To all of them a greeting, a grip, a grip. I want to tell all the Greeks that the P.S.D.G. is and will be aware of the circumstances in the face of such a major crisis. Secondly, I want to point out today also a satisfaction and a serene joy because, in the face of the demand presented by the General Administration of the State, justice has recovered the peace of Meirás to the public; an advance with historical memory, with democratic memory; an advance with the dignity of the reprisals of frankism and also a guarantee to continue building a better democracy. [[Applause]] I would like to acknowledge the work done by all the administrations, and in particular by the State Secretariat of Democratic Memory, which presented the demand with the Government of Spain, to which the various administrations of an autonomous, provincial and local nature were incorporated. On July 12th, the Greeks and the Greeks came to the polls. They were the elections of the coward, unlike any other who had been throughout the democratic stage. Elections in which the level of participation has fallen to 48% of the Greeks and Greeks who have the right to vote, 58% of the Greeks entitled to vote in the territory of our community. They were different elections and elections in which 253,000 Welsh and Welsh voted lists of the Socialist Party of Galicia. We want to tell them that we are going to comply with their message, that we know what they want from the Socialist Parliamentary Group and that we are going to act with responsibility. And to all the Greeks and Greeks, we say that the Socialist Parliamentary Group, that the socialists, we are going to meet the circumstances, putting the best of ourselves into such a complex legislation. The People\'s Party has won the election and we have transferred the congratulations to that political force and also to its candidate, with 627,000 votes, 50,000 votes less than four years ago; a most legitimate majority to rule, a majority that gives the People\'s Party strength to open a legislation for four years and a parliament in which there are three political forces: the conservative force, the nationalist force -- we have also transferred the congratulations to it for the result achieved -- and the force of the Socialists of Galicia. Most people have to manage it properly, because most people don\'t guarantee success in public policies, and that\'s why we\'re all going to have to be on time. Because there are many Greeks who voted, but there are also many Greeks who haven\'t been voting in such complex circumstances. And that\'s why we all have to do our best to build that Galicia better. We are the alternative to the policies of the People\'s Party. The 253,000 Galicians who voted for us made it because they ask us something different from what you\'ve applied over the past eleven years. We are going to be consistent with ideas, values and socialist proposals, and we are going to be because we defend the public for the fundamental to those who defend the private for everything, because we defend the struggle for equality as a benchmark and because we believe that policies are formulas to reform and change and not just to preserve from inaction. We will be and we are an alternative because we believe that the outcome of this crisis must be made in a different way than the crisis in 2008 and 2009. The policies of orthodoxy and austerity are already overcome, and this has to be a way out of the crisis with different public policies. [[Applause]] The crisis we are experiencing is the crisis of cowardice. This complex situation, of such magnitude, demands the best public policies, and that is why it has to be the legislated protection of people in the face of the economic, social and health crisis. The Galician Parliament and the Galician Self-Government must defend citizenship against this complexity, building a protective belt so that no one will stay behind and also looking for opportunities for the Greeks and for the Greeks. [[Applause]] We\'re dealing with cutting policies, we\'re dealing with public dismantling policies, we\'re dealing with policies that don\'t believe in the welfare state and public support for better recovery. Our project is alternative, because Galicia has been the worst, it has been less than eleven years of People\'s Party government. The Royal Galicia does not live in the happy Arcadia that transfers the People\'s Party to us. In eleven years of government Galicia lost population, lost employment, there are 70,000 less busy than before the coward crisis. The cowardly crisis has left the productive tissue weaker, more complex, in the primary sector, in the industrial sector, because, in addition, in the face of this crisis, we see as a lack of sufficient response by the German Government and as a lack of long and medium-term project for Galicia. Four years ago, Mr. candidate, you made commitments, and you failed many of your investment speech commitments. I promised a new Galician employment law and no one knows about that law. I promised that we would end the legislation with a unemployment rate below two digits and at the beginning of this year, in the first quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate was 12%. He promised rural legislation and didn\'t work in the rural areas of Galicia. He promised many infrastructures that are in his speech and did not fulfill it, for example, the extension of the Highway of the Coast of Death. He promised that we would make it to 2020 with the totally healthy Welsh streams and promise him again now in this investment speech. He promised multiple health investments in hospitals, from Gran Montecelo to so many investments in other cities, and he promises them again now. He has promised a programme to support older people who live alone and bring it back to this Parliament today. And he promised seven public residences, one in each of the big cities of Greece, and he didn\'t fulfill it. That\'s why we need a new approach and that\'s why we need a new challenge. [[Applause]] You asked yesterday, Mr. candidate, for government ministries to serve in Spain, but what the Greeks and the Greeks are asking themselves today is why it serves an Economic Counsellor who has not achieved the necessary measures to support our country\'s productive fabric, they ask themselves to serve a Social Policy Counsellor who exempts their responsibilities in so many areas of politics and asks whether it serves an Education Counsellor who has not taken measures to start the school course. And, therefore, they also wonder why a Government of the Galician Union should serve to discharge its responsibilities and want others to do their duty to it. And that\'s why we have to change that form of action. We cannot continue to face a crisis of such gravity, of such complexity, that we must govern and take action in complex circumstances. Of course, from an alternative position, we want to transfer to the People\'s Party that will have the tendon hand of the PSdeG-PSOE. Our vows are not necessary before an absolute majority, but we are going to put the best of ourselves to dialogue, to contribute, to seek agreements, to be able to accompany the political climate of the country and to make the best policies where the People\'s Party lacks content or lacks projects. That\'s why we assume that in this legislation on the protection of people we all have to be up to this time. And for that we want to address four major forward axes, which must lead the majority of the People\'s Party, but what you can count on is the vocation of dialogue and construction from the Socialist Party of Galicia. First of all, to make a ferocious defense of the social, of the priority of the social, in a legislation in which we have to give protection to the citizenship so that no one is left behind; a defense and strengthening of the public health system, the priority of social policies, a new model of residence and care for the elderly, to wager for a guaranteed education, for equality policies, for a defense of the feminist cause -- if you can also point to feminism in investment -- for policies that have to give opportunities to new people. [[Applause]] The priority of social policy will be the red line of the Socialist Party of Galicia. There can be no more setbacks, more cuts and more abandonments, a policy of citizenship protection must be made, and we want to work from the opposition by supporting the Government of the Union in all those measures that allow that advance. Secondly, we also want to talk about the country\'s economic reactivation. A Resolve plan for economic reconstruction, for the impulse of the productive sectors, for the creation of employment by the coward, is needed from sustainability and from the challenges of the ecological transition and digitization, also to bet on the rural environment and territorial vertebration; a second major line of agreement to work on the economic reconstruction of our country. Thirdly, we create a line of agreement that is fundamental to working on the regeneration and quality of institutions. And fourthly, the greatest agreement that can achieve this legislation on the protection of persons, the greatest agreement that we have to have the parliamentary groups represented in this Chamber is that Galicia has a status and has a self-government, and, in the face of Galicia\'s problems, we need a government of the Galician Union that exercises its powers, those of the Statute of Self-Government, in social policies, in industry, in economics, in health and in education. That\'s the biggest responsibility for the big deal there has to be in the legislation. The rule of protection of persons has the challenge of reaching an agreement for the Government of the United States to exercise and fulfil its responsibility. They apply the Statute of Self-Government as the greatest guarantee for this legislation. [[Applause]] During these eleven years of the People\'s Party\'s government, there has been evidence of a kind of health policy that is different from what the Socialist Party defends for our country. The cowardly crisis has shown that the priority of the public health system is fundamental, and it is up to us, even more so now. The eleven-year balance of cuts, the precariousness of employment and the dismantling of so many services of the People\'s Party\'s policies for us is negative, and for the Greeks and Greeks who vote for the Socialist Party, the balance of the people\'s health management is also negative. You are part of an analysis that is unreal, of a number of investments that are not met, because the budgets of the Galician Union, in real terms, this year, are inferior to those that were when you arrived at the Galician Union if you update the matches according to the IPC, something that any student of 1st Economy or any family knows. He bought 2,000 million euros in health care in 11 years in real terms, because there are 500 beds less in public hospitals than when you arrived in front of the Galician Union, because he cut in budgets, staff and primary care, because he eliminated services in many comarcal hospitals and because employment is more precarious. There\'s a falsity of reality when you want to sell that investment, that bet you haven\'t given. We believe that there must be a clear bet, and of course we believe that this crisis has highlighted the need for an amendment to the entire health policy of the People\'s Party. So we\'re going to put forward proposals, we\'re going to come up with ideas, we\'re going to work with what we have: a project for Galicia. Among other things, because there are new funds. At the first part of the bottom of the vault, Galicia receives €268 million to spend on health care, and the network of professionals and public health resources needs to be strengthened, a genuine plan to improve primary care is to be implemented -- which has been the great damage throughout its policy -- and a new primary care centre must be provided and commitments made to hospitals must be met. In addition, it is necessary to adapt the user ratios per physician to ensure that there is a lower load of patients per physician in primary care. And, of course, we have to set up an extraordinary human resource stabilization program, because there is room to do so, and you don\'t even meet the minimum that can be established, which is to generate the maximum of stable squares that allow for effective legislation. It is necessary to work on that line to convene 5,000 stable squares for health professionals in this legislation, and we must work with the other autonomous communities and with the Ministry of Health and with the Government of Spain to reach an agreement that will enable us to move towards the abolition of the replacement rate for the health system. We must summon these squares which have been covered by potential people in a continuous manner for so many years. There are many nurses and nurses who accumulate daily, weekly contracts and who are claiming greater commitment to this government and this autonomous chamber. You have to lower the eventuality below 8%, and you have to develop a Welsh mental health plan, which you\'re again working on now, right now, after you haven\'t fulfilled it in all the years they\'ve had of government. It is important, Mr candidate, to develop a catalogue of basic hospital services that ensure the permanent presence, in the comarcas hospitals, of the services of greater use and the needs of the population with stable staff in the centre itself, and it must be reinforced also in the face of the risks involved in this crisis of cowardice. We have to bet on the public, so that at the end of this legislation we can get the entire population of Greece to have as a reference hospital a public management centre and we have to raise investment in health research. We must also move towards a challenge which is complex, but where there are difficulties and which we must also collectively assume - I certainly agree with you in that intention - that we must progressively incorporate full oral care into Sergas for people with more difficulties. So we want to work on the cure. In his speech, candidate Mr. Feijóo, we agreed when yesterday he suggested that a reinforcement of the public health department should be done, or when he announced that a massive test line would be opened from saliva samples. Of course, we give all health professionals and also to those responsible all the congratulations for this going ahead, but the credibility of the People\'s Party is lacking in everything they could do in eleven years and they haven\'t done: their commitment to primary care, their commitment to mental health and their commitment to staff. That\'s a challenge; there are old challenges that have not met and that we hope they will now meet in the next four years. You promised yesterday, Mr. Feijóo, a new Greek health service, an integral renewal of Sergas. But what\'s the model? What\'s the project? What\'s going to change the organization, the operation of that system? Because nothing made it clear. He talked about improving health professionals\' conditions, but they didn\'t come true. And he also spoke of sending an organic health law these days to the Government of Spain; an organic law from which the rest of the parliamentary groups have no knowledge. I want to ask you whether you believe that each of the seventeen autonomous communities should refer their draft organic public health law to address the difficulties in the country, because you and the People\'s Party also have Members in the Government of Spain, and there is a commission, the Commission for Economic and Social Reconstruction, with a health area in which you, your deputies and your leader, Mr. Casado, can also carry it forward - firstly, agreed at least with the communities you govern - [[Applause]] The policies that you have applied, Mr Feijóo, in health matters, are not ours, and we are open to working together to defend public health and to do so with the Council of Health and the Presidency of the Government of Galicia in the face of the cuts and setbacks that have occurred in the past. We have to bet on public health, but bet on public health isn\'t putting up a poster in Verín that says, ""public hospital."" The Greeks and the Greeks who listen to us know about the waiting lists, about the problems of appointments in primary care -- especially in these summer weeks -- and also about the weaknesses of a telephone system that separates the type of treatments. The Galicians who listen to us also want to know which are the 6,000 trackers you know and which no one else knows. The Greeks who listen to us want seriousness and commitment to the defense of health, and there we will be with the Government of Galician Union. Secondly, within the social sphere, I would also like to highlight the importance of collective residences and social policies. The cowardly crisis has revealed the risks to majors and residences, and the truth is what is happening these days in the Incio residence, where there have already been seven deaths, which shows once again that the situation that is living is terrible, which is very complex. We must face a debate in depth on the issue of residences and take all necessary measures so that what has happened cannot be repeated. Almost half of the deceased in Galicia were higher in residences. Galicia needs a new residence model and a new adult care model, as you yourself recognized during the election campaign. The protocols failed, the inspection failed and we did not comply with the number of public initiative squares in Galicia in senior residences, where, according to the World Health Organization\'s barriers, 14,000 homes fail. We must comply with this legislation by moving forward. The Board of Auditors, in its 2016 report, pointed out that the forecast of inspections went down immensely in those years, that the system of inspections and sanctions was addicted and that it did not comply with the inspections of residences. The director of the DomusVi residence, in Santiago, made public a letter of enormous gravity before the first wave of the pandemic, pointing out that he had to be given priority over the hospital for the sick and not for those patients who were more serious; that is, the most serious had to be in residence in order of priorities. The public complaints of the workers and the workers of the residences and the family statements require an answer. I would like to ask you, candidate, Mr Feijóo, to commit itself to this Parliamentary House today to support a research commission to study what happened in residences, to learn from mistakes and, on the basis of those conclusions, to build a better model of residences in Galicia. We owe it to the victims, we owe it to the families, we owe it to Galicia, for dignity. [[Applause]] Mr. Feijóo, yesterday you announced a new residence and health protocol, and you also announced a new regulation that regulates the conditions for opening up and operating senior residences. Were the protocols and regulations that existed wrong? How will you develop that new regulation to regulate them? We want to contribute because we know it\'s a complex issue, because we all know that we\'re worried about what happens in residences and with our seniors, but we also want to have the information of that new regulation that you\'ve announced and that happened less in your investment speech, but that you have a huge political silence for what happened in residences, and that we have to learn to apply it in the future. This new model is necessary and it is necessary to audit and review compliance with existing regulations and protocols in residences. You have to bet on the public, and you have to make integrated residences, you have to see when they apply and why you don\'t look for those mechanisms in residences like the Incio ones, too, to give the best assurances. We are all parliamentary groups very concerned about what happened in residences, what happens and what can happen. Of course, all the criticisms that we make in management during this time we do them with the constructive character that we must have, knowing that every time there is a problem in each of the members of the Government and the People\'s Group -- they\'re also in the staff -- they\'re concerned, but we have to give the politician the best response, in the powers of the Government of the Union, and also with the responsibility of the opposition. Social policies are fundamental, because, according to different estimates and we will cut down, the number of Greeks who lived in poverty before the cowardly crisis may be between 540,000 or 622,000, or even something else. Now, with data from reports like Oxfam, it\'s announced that there are 44,000 more Greeks in poverty. We must strengthen the social contract, the protective belt to the welfare state. There is progress in the state, and we must also take responsibility. We have to defend, without a doubt, advances, such as the minimum vital income, but also assume the competences and responsibilities of the Board when there is a delay and a delay to recognize cases of dependence, or also to process risk. There are many problems, because the municipalities have to get there, where the Government of Galicia does not meet, and the priority of social is fundamental for anyone to stay behind. We must also develop a new housing policy - and then, if I have time, I will make a bigger reference - and also a youth policy based on three major axes: housing, employment and training. The Greeks and the Greeks are worried. In the media a neighbor says so. He\'s between two fronts: one for his grandfather, Imprisoned in Aldan\'s residence, and so he\'s starring protests on the street to claim better hieriac assistance, and another for his 11-year-old daughter, who has suffered a three-year-old stroke that has caused him hemiparesia, a paralysis of a whole side of his body and which depicts his muscle. He says this second battle is also playing with these little ones, and he doesn\'t understand that physiotherapy clinics can work on a private level and that they can\'t have social security, as before -- although it was scarce -- two sessions a week for 20 minutes. The families went to hospitals, but now they\'re not told anything or know anything about the reopening of physiotherapy. That\'s how I pick up a media today, and I move it here, because it\'s people\'s voice, people\'s difficulties, beyond the general discourse we can make of worry. That is also a matter of concern to you at the beginning of the school course, which is complex, but undoubtedly there was a radical suspension from the management of the Education Council. Ten major areas of action are needed. [[Applause]] It is necessary to be bet by more teachers to lower student fees by classroom classes by classroom, and while other communities have sought out recruitment formulas for special teaching staff staff to start the course, Galicia has stayed in line at the time of the course; because it was not studied either the possibility of using additional spaces to de-work classes; because there was no student\'s digitization plan to be prepared for all children and all children in Galicia if there is a problem of paralization of activity in their school centre if there is a problem of paralylization of work in school if there is a problem of health professionals and they are landing in such a complex situation; because it is necessary for everyone to have a computer computer, a device and data to be able to follow the school course in any situation; because it is necessary to provide prevention mechanisms for the prevention of masks, temperature control mechanisms for all children and all children in Galician children in Galicia, because there is a health care need to be strengthened and because teachers are not health care provided by health care and teachers and because teachers are not safe, because teachers are needed, because teachers are needed to be able to be able to provide the lines of the specific help, and to provide the practical, but they are the practical tools and to provide, to be they provide the practical needs and to be as they provide, to be as they provide as they provide, to ensure that they provide, to be as they provide the practical, to be as they provide the practical, to be as they provide the practical, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to be as they provide, to ensure, to ensure, to be able, to ensure, to ensure, to be as they provide the practical, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure, to ensure that the practical, and to ensure that the practical, to ensure that the practical, to ensure that the practical, to ensure that the practical, and to ensure that the practical, and to ensure, and to ensure that [[Applause]] In the funds of the Government of the Galician Union, it has just had EUR 93 million in order to be able to make more policies in the field of its competence. You\'ll have to see how many teachers will be hired, where they\'ll invest, and what\'s the virtual teaching plan. We have to. I also have to point out that it\'s important to advance in university politics, looking for no one to get access. There is a measure which we are asking for in this Parliament and which can be done without a great budgetary cost, which is to apply that the first registrations in the Greek university system are free for all and all students in Galicia. It can be done, it involves little cost and it can be addressed. And, of course, we would like to ask you, Mr. candidate, Mr. Feijóo, to make a clear commitment to the Greek university system and to the public university, that your government will not take any measure at risk, which threatens, the public university of all the Greeks and all the Greeks. With the public university system, we don\'t play and we have to work with the three principals to reach any agreement that will modify the titration map or, of course, the creation of any system. [[Applause]] We would also like to ask you, Mr Feijóo, to deepen your policies of equality, of course, in the fight against male violence and in the defence of women\'s rights, because that is a fundamental challenge. In all crises, women get worse off and more damaged in a situation. And we also want to tell you to try, in the configuration of your government, to meet a historical demand of the German feminist movement. You believe in an equal council to represent the power of women, to give impetus to the feminist commitment, and also to have a gesture that equates that situation. [[Applause]] [[Applause]] We want to expand the networks of information centres for the woman, which must be taken to all regions. It is necessary to develop shelters for all women who are victims of violence or who have been victims of violence. We have to sink into it. And, of course, in the matter of equality, we will lend all the collaboration and all the willingness to improve, because it is a challenge we all have to be at all. Mr candidate, if we have a fundamental concern in the field of social policies, I mean that in the face of an unprecedented crisis, with such a widespread collapse of economic activity, we are deeply concerned about your economic discourse. The workers who listen to that speech are more alert, the self-employed, who are full of difficulties, more worried, the unemployed, no line of action and the most concerned entrepreneurs. His speech worries because he lacks a realistic diagnosis and above all a plan of action. There is no roadmap in economic matters in the Government of Unity. For you, the big balance is that Galicia was going very well, better than the rest before the crisis and that Galicia is also better during the crisis. But the truth is that Galicia loses opportunities, that there is less capacity for employment, that it is a country where the possibilities for the future are smaller and that that is why the population also falls, because where there is employment there are citizens willing to be working, to generate wealth and to contribute. And here we lose the busy population and we have to see what the effect of this crisis is on the occupied population of the country. Its vision was partial and biased by certain indicators that try to prevent us from having a community with less income, less wages and a less dynamic and less competitive economy and that 70,000 jobs were lost from 2009 to 2020 - 70,000 are less occupied at the same time that in Spain 670,000 jobs were created -. This crisis of cowardice is a warning to all. Galicia suffered a very severe fall in the production level, in the second quarter, a drop of 17.9%, where 22% of Galician workers were affected by ERTE or redundancies, where industrial production fell by 42%, where business figures in the service sector fell by 19%, where exports dropped by 35.4% in the worst moments of the crisis. It\'s a historic recession in Galicia too. It\'s an economy with less cyclical behavior, with less peak behavior, but very strong, in addition to in inns, in leisure, in culture, in tourism, in transport. We need something else, because it\'s true that having an economy based on a certain level in the agri-food sector or also on the evolution of automotive, which depends on external factors, has implied that dynamism makes the fall not as deep as in other communities, where the level, for example, of international tourism is decisive. But it\'s true that in a poorer community, if we still have a crisis, what the Greeks and the Greeks receive is more risky, there\'s a deterioration in the living conditions of many people, there\'s more people affected by unemployment, there\'s a more complex situation for long-term unemployed, there\'s and there\'ll be more homes without income and damage to collectives and young people. There are problems. The European Union looked for a new time, moved on to the paradigm of orthodoxy and austerity, looked for new mechanisms: broadening debt, assuming new policies and extra funds of covid in agreements as never before. In Spain too, it has advanced in social innovations such as ERTE, such as minimum vital income, such as opening up to self-employed people. What is Galician model? What is the model of the autonomous community to face all these challenges? There is no programme, no measures or economic plan for Galicia. There is no diagnosis of the production structure or the cycle, no balance of the impact of the vault, no challenges to cover; and the most worrying, no measures or orientation. That is why we need to carry out this commission for the economic and social reconstruction of the country, where we are going to contribute, where we want to collaborate and give the best of ourselves in the face of this lack of projects for the country\'s economy in macro policies, micro policies and sectoral policies. Because you announced a reactivating plan of EUR 3,000 million in campaign that didn\'t involve anything, because you announced in campaign that 15,000 public employment squares would be created and I don\'t know if it was a fake news because yesterday in your investment speech you didn\'t even transfer the electoral commitment to generate 15,000 public employment squares. It was their commitment to the rules that exist and must comply with the growth, employment, for the defence of the productive sectors. [[Applause]] There is a need for a new economic policy that is linked to digitization, to the energy and ecological transition, because the generation of energy with fossil fuels has been abandoned, because these new working relationships are necessary that they study how they affect the telematics issue, and it is also necessary to meet the demographic challenge, because it is necessary that, after the last four years there has not been economic policy for the rural environment and there has been no progress, action is now being taken, and because a new industrial policy is needed. The powers given to us by the Statute are full in economic matters and, of course, they have a capacity to develop industrial policy, but there is none. In eleven years you throw balloons out, you get profiled; you have to move forward and you have to work. Who\'s got the chance to find an investor for a company like Alcoa in Lugo? Why hasn\'t the Joint Government been working since the first time? We want to ask you to commit yourself, to work everywhere for employment and industrial activity in Alcoa San Cibrao, and there will be a great deal of agreement to look for all measures to guarantee that job in the face of the lack of functions of a government of the Union that nothing has posed, that nothing has solved and that has had no chance; all measures, because our commitment is to Galicia, it is to the Greeks and to the Greeks. We have to work on reindustrialization of areas like The Bridges, like Cerceda; and of course we have to do so in collaboration with the Government of Spain. And, of course, we will support all those reindustrialization projects, those future projects that the Council of Economics and Industry presents to the Greeks and to the Greeks. We need to reformulate the Igape to make it an agency of genuine economic promotion, of industrial impulse, attached to productive tissue, not just like a liquidity agency. We have to look for these mechanisms too to give the workers of Navantia all the possibility of workload until the frigates arrive. This new sector policy is needed in tourism, culture, hospitality and also in R & D+i policies. Mr. Feijóo, it\'s also time for a great deal of agreement on regeneration and institutional quality in Galicia. That agreement has to go through different areas. Here, in Parliament\'s opinion, a great deal must be reached so that, after the absence of the President of the Chair at the parliamentary headquarters throughout all that goes on year, especially in the crisis of the vault, Mr President, the candidate for the presidency, undertakes to appear during the time of the crisis of the vault at least once every month in order to be able to share, discuss, analyse and propose proposals for our Galicia. The President of the Council of Galicia must be performing his duties in the Executive and also fulfilling such difficulties with accountability before this Parliament. We must also work for this institutional quality with a re-consideration of the use made by the People\'s Party of the Public Media of Galicia and the TVG. In this legislation there has to be a change and it has to be a change also for plurality, for impartial information, for the quality of the work of professionals who ask to defend Galicia continuously for so many weeks.', 'Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. The second half of 2019 is being prodigal in signals of a cycle change in the global economy. It has already been assumed that, at best, we will have to face a slowdown in the economy, if not an even greater blow. In October, the IMF generally lowered forecasts for major economies. For our part, the 2.2% growth expected by the Basque Government for 2019 is the lowest in our community since the end of 2014. And next year\'s forecast lowers this figure to 2%. These figures, without indicating an imminent recession, do indicate a clear trend towards slowing economic growth. After the great recession, this global slowdown is already underway, and it is the short-term economic framework of a more complex bottom-up global reality, which is starred by four fundamental vectors that define the structural evolution of the situation: two crises, one revolution and one disruption. The two crises, the ecological and that of inequality. The revolution, the feminist. Disruption, technology. We will briefly review these macrotendencies of global transformation, not by intellectual curiosity, but by the realization that these global phenomena completely determine reality, also our reality, and are the unspeakable framework from which any analysis that wants to be effective must start. We will start with the ecological crisis, as its satisfactory resolution is a sine qua non. The second major crisis is that of economic inequality. The struggle of the working class and the existence of an apparently feasible countermodel led to sustained economic growth in Western countries during the decades following World War II, accompanied by an unprecedentedly balanced distribution of benefits. The defeat of the socialist bloc in the Cold War and the subsequent neoliberal hegemony have reversed this distribution, and we again witness a brutal concentration of wealth, which translates into exponential growth in the number of billionaires and their power. While, as the OECD itself recently warned, the middle class is contracting for forced marches and increasing social exclusion. Societies become polarized, the majority lose rights and resources. Democracy is unravelled in the face of powers in the shadow, and the elites impose their agenda on a political class that is subject to: wage cuts, tax cuts for the rich, and the support of the dwindling public services in charge of pressure on the lower classes. The prevailing malaise makes the discourses facing the poor stronger, supported by an economic power that encourages these ultra pseudo-solutions as an antidote to an analysis that proposes to reverse the unjust distribution of wealth. The feminist revolution, on the other hand, is something that makes sense at this time. The most important phenomenon that has affected us to live to whom we are alive today. The deepest socio-cultural change in the history of humanity, because it affects the status of half of its components, which has become aware of its absolute and irrefutable equality and of the need to apply that equality to all facets of life. This struggle empowers women and challenges men, because it forces us to renounce acquired privileges. But it forces all to make an effort to detect and deconstruct the social, mental, economic and other structures generated under the framework of patriarchy. A revolution that still faces many battles until it achieves the ultimate and radical goal of equality among all people. And finally, in the field of technology, it should only be noted here that we are facing an imminent future in which technological changes will be so profound that they will alter the productive processes and generate new opportunities. But also dangers and challenges of a dimension never seen: artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, quantum computing, biotechnology, new energy sources, will change our way of understanding the economy and society, of understanding the world. These global phenomena affect us, they have an immediate translation. And we have to make decisions about these phenomena here and now, also in the context of the budgetary debate. Because they ask us to choose our place before the dichotomies that pose us. Will we fight climate change and the ecological transition or will we fall into negationism? Or in that light form Not that paradigm changes happen, but that change is the new paradigm. This obliges us to a permanent exercise of adaptation, resilience, foresight and proactivity. The situation requires analytical capacity to detect problems, capacity to formulate strategies, with medium and long-term vision, and ability to articulate the plurality of actors involved in shared dynamics. It requires, in short, leadership. An attitude diametrically opposed to that of a Basque Government that strives to deny problems while it can, attributing responsibility to others or claiming that in Spain they are worse, when problems are already undeniable, and to appear to do things instead of facing the underlying problems, with the intention of not touching their neoliberal dogmas. The crisis in 2008 has been extremely important. During crisis time, the remunerations have multiplied. And when the crisis is over, these resolutions continue to work. We can\'t recover the ethovnat, we won\'t recover the previous state, with all its deficiencies, just for the sake of mere growth. The growth has returned, but not the rights, because they have changed the rules of the game. This new reality demands new answers, and politics must give proper and effective answers. Otherwise, the answers will be sought elsewhere in rage and self-discipline, but not in democracy. PNV believes in the theory of the minimal state: The economy thinks it\'s business. And he also uses old conceptions, which are not already useful in a world that has changed. We\'re in a real reality, we\'re in a new reality, and we can\'t play ostrich. The mere economic growth will not contribute to the improvements of the economic elites, because they have sabotaged the pay and taxes, and consequently it would have to be the work of public power to activate the dynamics of reconstructing those systems. But unfortunately, that\'s not the way we do it. It\'s disappointing to see that after the social tax has been lowered, the sectors of the right Basque have already started trying to deactivate the tax. It\'s disappointing to see you run away from the conversation of your wages, get ready to keep the minimum pay of 1,200, so that you won\'t push the Factic. Instead of looking for arguments, instead of looking for gaps to set up. The weight of Soldate has descended 1,8 points from 2012, that is, from the entrance of Urkullu into the government to 2017. We\'ve been robbed for 1,8 points on the sod. That\'s what I\'m talking about when the rains are in the glass, or when Machadok (the great Machado) wrote, ""Motonía de lluvia los cristales."" In the season of the Urkullu, we have receded in several strategic respects. Four significant examples: The medical investment in the EAE budget, 2012, was the 5th,17 of the raw internal product, 2020 in budget, 483. Back in health. Education investment in 2012, 3,89, 2020 funds, 3.53. Back in education. In research and development, 2012, 2,09, 2020... Excuse me, this is the date of 1,85, 2018. Back in research. And the weight of budget, as a whole economy, repels it: In 2012, budgets were supposed to be the 14,4 of the raw internal procedure, and in this budget project the 13ths. Back in public expense too. There are more troubling data. We\'ve often accused him of comparing our community\'s data to other communities. We believe that the most developed countries are needed socially and economically. But doing this is also dangerous. It is dangerous to take the state as a reference frame, when you choose a pattern, because you will eventually resemble it. And that\'s what\'s happening to us. Our historic leadership has already disappeared into various areas. Madrid\'s ahead of us, per capita. Not only are there bad results in comparison with the state; there are many other indicators that are illuminated with red light. The government emphasises that the unemployment rate of the VAC is 9,2 % – the councillor has stressed it today – that the unemployment rate of the VAC is 9,2 %. But that 9.2% is a very high rate for the European Union, very high. The European Union has an average unemployment rate of 6.3, an average. Only Greece, Italy and Spain are behind that Basque 9.2%. Worse still, even worse, while in the European Union the current unemployment rate is the lowest in history, in the CAV we tripled the best record we achieved in 2007 with 3.1. And then they tell us that ""I have fulfilled the goal of the legislature"" – a small objective – and that is not to mention the increasing precariousness of the labour market. In 2018, more than one million contracts were signed, but nine out of ten were temporary; half with a duration of less than or equal to one month. Big way. All negative indicators – unemployment, poverty, precariousness, temporaryity – are aggravated for women, who have a personal income of 23.5 % lower, a difference that is multiplying among pensioners. According to the Poverty and Social Inequalities Survey, poverty and the risk of poverty are rising. There are already 172,000 people at risk of poverty, 14% more than in 2016, despite years of growth; and 41% more than in 2008. Do you remember the story of the three pigs? One made his house of straw, another of wood and the third of bricks. Something like this has happened with the impact of the crisis on the different economies of the different states. Everyone has felt the wolf\'s breath, the hurricane of the crisis, but the degree of impact has been different depending on the strength of the pre-existing economic structures. The strongest economies, after the 2008-2009 cyclone, were recovering GDP as early as 2010-2011. The Spanish State did not do so until 2017. His economic house was straw. Our wooden one. The worst is that we are now gathering the timber to rebuild a house of boards and sticks, instead of taking advantage of the 2008 catharsis to rethink the country and make bets to strengthen our model, moving towards a productive fabric based on the cutting-edge industry and knowledge, which does not leave behind people or regions. But for that to happen, political leadership was needed, and that was not the case. Here tourism grows more than industry. And the government is fine with it. We have a government that pays more to its police than to its scientists or its teachers, that rakes the salary and denies stability to the research staff, that keeps its university public in minimums, that sends predoctoral students abroad with scholarships of misery, so that they are both doctoral students and waiters. We have rents higher than many wages. We have come down to the third European innovation division. And in R & D effort we are closer to Spain than to Germany. We are leading the loss of purchasing power of wages in the state. We have a country where its rulers work harder in what Chomsky called ""making consent"" than in the actual resolution of problems. A country in which the ubiquitous presence of the government in the media and the concatenation of properly magnified inconsequential events seeks to generate the image of the ""Euskadi goes well"". In this country, young people are mobilized to have a planet on which to live their future, while the backpack we put their elders on their backs is Glovo\'s yellow backpack. Demography challenge is as disturbing as an example of failure. Don\'t pay attention to all the warnings and warnings, the situation is over, without making any definite diagnosis, without any appropriate focus, without applying any form measure, without educating the productive complicity with the socialists. While they call us Euscadi va bien, we have ceased to be children, and returned to the womb after the war. But as they\'re short-assed in this government, the budgets of this year have collected and grafted in a speech like veneer, not in budgets. Three disguises have been tried to put on the budget. green, purple, and red. I believe that the social pessimism of these budgets is proved by all the data which has hitherto been given, for the same economic policies which have hitherto been developed are collected, and we have just seen the results. Mozorro moreaz beasts eztabaidetan hitz egiteko aukera izango dugu. Azter\'s disappointed in the Berdean Mozor Orin. 20% of the so-called green package falls from withdrawal: 510 million. Of the 510 million, 100, who are dedicated to VAD, contrary to what the councilwoman expressed in the committee. And beyond the discussion of whether these investments are climate friendly or not, what is clear is that they are not investments to compute to the Basque Government; in any case, to the Madrid Government. And if the Basque Government is to be reckoned with, it would have to be agreed that there have been much more ambitious budgets in this legislature to respond to climate change, such as in 2017, when the departure of the TAV – this ecological, supposedly ecological departure – was 355 million. It is not normal to include a Renove plan to cover the purchase of diesel and petrol vehicles as a part of the climate change agenda. And there are many other games of very dubious lace, such as those designed to organize industrial soils or to support slopes. The thing about supporting slopes was about sustainability. It is not acceptable to include consignments for the exploitation of hydrocarbons, such as those dedicated to Shesa. It\'s not a green budget. And squandering the contribution that We can make to the section that they themselves have called adaptation to climate change The main contribution of Podemos to the green budget is truly glorious, because it has been to endorse a cut in the funds intended to finance the energy transition of the administrations. We may not have achieved 100 million to finance the energy sustainability of public administrations, what we may have achieved is that the government can postpone the implementation of a legally binding mandate. They have reapplied a twisted version of the foral pass with the Law on Energy Sustainability of Public Administrations. I am not going to say that you have applied the foral pass, because this concept of foral pass is clothed with dignity. What you have done can be called the ""forral step"", because you pass through the lining what the law collects. They again deactivate, as they have done with the RGI, through the Budgets Act, the improvements achieved in the fight for ecology, and they inapply an article of the law, which, strictly, determines the creation of a financial instrument that will be constituted with 100 million in this exercise, and not in 2027. They are helping the Government to do things wrong in the fight against climate change. They are supporting their strategy of turning into a political marketing issue, which is a matter of survival for the planet. They legitimize the government\'s false green speech and facilitate it to evade its responsibilities. And since we\'re talking about cuts sponsored by Podemos, let\'s move on to the one registered in the RGI. Imagine that they have an employment agreement in force that includes a 5% wage increase. The company, although having profits, unilaterally decides to raise their salary by only 1 %. How would you consider that decision, an ascent to celebrate, even if not all that was agreed upon, or an illegitimate cut in your rights, which requires a mobilizing response? In Podemos they have celebrated the cut of the RGI. So I guess for them the valid answer is the first. The reduction of the rights contained in the income guarantee law, approved by the PNV and endorsed by Podemos-EQUO, does not correspond to a moment of budgetary tension or economic tightening, but to an ideological decision. It is cut and the Urkullu government cuts down on the most needy, because it believes that they are given much. And that\'s the key. You believe that they are given, because we are faced with a almsy logic and not a logic of rights. The society conquered, after a popular struggle, culminated with the partial institutional acceptance of the demand, the right to a guaranteed minimum income, not subdued, guaranteed for all people. And that seems too much to this government. They have transmuted a right into an obscene annual auction, in which it seems that the income of the most needy people can be referred, not to their basic needs, but to the policy of budgetary alliances of the Government. We can have a bad deal with the PNV, not because it\'s agreement or because it\'s PNV, but because it\'s bad. In exchange for 100 million in two years, the other 100 million, as has already been shown, are those that are bound to comply with the Energy Sustainability Act, and are tied to the PNV for the rest of the legislature. It is a lower negotiating capacity than that of the People\'s Party, which took 40 million; but, in addition, a fiscal reform of its taste and support for Rajoy\'s budgets, which seems to me to be a much more consistent baggage than its own. But that\'s not the worst. The worst is that we can, to justify a political decision, change your orientation, I don\'t know if tactical or strategic ""The PNV representative was talking about a change of strategy,"" but to justify his changes, he is washing his face to the PNV. They are collaborating in legitimizing the policies of the PNV, scrimmaging a supposed ecological, feminist and social shift in budgets, which no one sees. Idoia Mendia settled the debate with roundness, when asked about this supposed turn that, by the way, the journalist in the question itself, described as deception. Idoia Mendia says The ELA union wondered what has changed, budgets or Podemos. I do not think there is anyone in this House or in the whole country who doubts what the answer is, even if some do not have the political maturity to recognize it. For the irresponsibility of Podemos, by granting the label Fortunately, everyone has the credibility he has, and the Basque left have done more complicated things. EHGGA gives rise to strong public policies, to accommodate to the new and fundamental reality which we have as society, and to provide for protection and opportunity, and to secure a fair distribution of wealth. This requires changes; in some cases structural. These, in our opinion, are some which must be underlined and answered: The first, the new attorney and financer of the course, in response to the romances which we have as a people, is to abandon the extreme political policy and to force new economic policies. Strengthening social motion, adapting the production model or applying the challenge produced by the ecological transition. We have opportunity and need to strengthen public expenditure, the financial situation of the EAE Administration allows us to take other measures in the attorney and financial policy, while the other is defending this dogma of the limits of deficit zero. It is therefore necessary, therefore, to agree and put on the new course of debt and defence, designed here for new revenues. Second, high-quality employment. It is necessary to make a step forward in this strategic artery, to give a firm answer to the extended preventive predominance of structure. It is also necessary that we should have a model of works closely connected with our social social reality and the model of production, and for this purpose receive new powers immediately, in cases of passive employment. But right now, I\'m sure it\'ll take initiative, even in so short a time, to make it work, like the commitment to a minimum salary of 1,200% of all public contracts and contracting with public money, or 1200 dollars at least EAE\'s minimum salary de facto. Third, where we can face climateal emergency, we need to force the transformive local projects. This is why it is important that bold and modern measures should be established in this area, and that, among other things, a financial instrument to promote local administrations, as has been defined by the law, with 100 million a year. Four, the change in the production model. To win the future in this strategic bet section three percent of raw internal procedure and three percent of development, strengthening the funds for the root of the main companies, and linking their commitment or carrying digitalization to small and average companies if there are some leading initiatives to perform. Five, the public care of confessing and regulating the work of care. In particular, the state of the care-makers is pitiful and denounced: feminised, pretor and rejected, often rendered invisible. There is no way forward in the way of equality without adopting any changeable decision about the watch pattern. It is therefore a duty to assume the responsibility due to public institutions, to value the condition of the sector, and to guarantee the social services of care. Six, backup system compact and complete. The uncertainty and insecurity of new reality make direct opposition to our defense system, and exposes its privations and gaps. It is therefore necessary to adapt to the new state that the development of public systems is necessary, for instance, to prevent the reduction of the revenue, to bring back new resources to strengthen the level of security, the security of society, in order to do something in order to defray the pensions, or in order to do something more, or to provide for money to develop significant policies, such as the housing policy. And strengthening reference services of quality. When we have been in the object of reduction for years, weakened, and, in respect of quality, public services fall into decay. The workman has also been reduced, either by obedience to the promise of the state, or by using it as an excuse. The rate of provisionalness is also terrible, within 40 percent. Changing the course is urgent, paying special attention to the survival of the workers during the production of generations. Even in education, a change of direction is indispensable, and a preference to an advanced pattern. Not forgetting that we\'re in a budget argument, it\'s very important to put them in place and join the other files in the public policy puzzle. As a matter of fact, there are budgets that have the most significant public policies that have been developed in the year, but not the only one. If we really want the political subject that wants to protect and protect its own people, the Basque Republic is our wager, and all the elements of politics must be in the hands of that subject. For we cannot forget that to be significant public policies is to have adequate rights, since in the case of EAE it is necessary to get news. And in conclusion, today\'s tool for being significant public policies is also indispensable. In our case, a new political state, founded on the mutual relations of the same. It\'s not a whim. The absence of these instruments in the sobarian world, for example, is serious. Many times the coherence and efficiency are lost, and we have no power to reach what unjust circumstances there are, without these functions. And often, too, there\'s that handful of handbags that don\'t give you any trouble about the chances that are in your hands. But, in any case, when we look into the state we have, by the associations of strength, and by the strength and dymism which are in society, there is no doubt but that it would be to improve the conditions of men\'s lives. The draft budget for 2020 is a clear exponent of the short-term and inertial vision of the Basque Government, and, more than ever, is an exponent of its commitment to political marketing, above real policies. We are faced with the same product in different wrapper. They have redesigned the boat, and painted some green, purple and red traces to direct it to a new market segment. But if we read the composition, we see that the product is exactly the same. The ingredients are the same and in the same proportion. We have not yet returned to the 2008 situation, even with all the shortcomings that, of course, also existed at that time. But we have missed five years of strong global growth to close the socio-economic wounds left by the crisis. With this budget, we will also miss another year, 2020. We need yes, we need a shield to face the times ahead, a shield to protect people, but not a shield of words and headlines, but a shield of determined economic resources and policies. We need a public service system that involves a shared security network, which guarantees basic rights and material resources to the entire population, the best health and education system that allows everyone to deploy their capacities, regardless of their socio-economic status. We need ambitious green transition policies to address climate change and the biodiversity crisis. We need public institutions to increase their efforts for effective equality between men and women. We need a boost to the productive system so that our industry can cope with the colossal process of disruptive transmutation involving globalization and technological development. Through social struggle, mobilization, denunciation and proposal, and also from institutional political action, we are gaining hegemony in the discourse: ecological transition, business roots, R & D, disadvantaged regions, defence of small trade, equality... The terminology of people who want change and future is being imposed. Now it is necessary to put numbers to these letters, but this draft budgets does not take that step, and we are presented as a clone of previous budgets. That\'s why we say no to these budgets, because we and we don\'t drink with marketing or cuts. We want real commitments, not words. The firmness of the present is the seed of real changes in the future. Thank you.', ""Thank you very much, President. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. By chance, today, July 14, coinciding with the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille, an essential milestone of the French Revolution, considered the beginning of the Modern State, the triumph of the Enlightenment and the Republican principles of freedom, equality and fraternity, is the date on which this House raises the full debate on the law of climate change and energy transition. It is a law that aims to transform our economy and society in an important way, to lay the foundations for a more just and inclusive future, a better use of resources, taking into account the best knowledge, warnings and recommendations of illustrated science. We want more freedom to innovate on the basis of knowledge; we want more equality, equal opportunities and access to environmental benefits; we want more fraternity, that third republican principle that is often forgotten. Fraternity, solidarity between generations and between those who share the present time, a non-cruel revolution that must allow us to lay the foundations for the Spain of the twenty-first century that the citizens ask, for justice between generations, to act according to the sciences and to promote an industrial revolution that allows us to lead production and employment within the environmental limits. Although fortunately, they are a minority, there are still those in our country who do not listen to science, who for decades have known and warned about the causes and consequences of climate change and whose conclusions are increasing and confirming with the passage of time and the continuous finding of factual evidence. It is surprising that citizens, whether young people on the streets or organised civil society, trade unions, who have been explaining opportunities for creating green jobs, or international consensus, are not listening either, but it is perhaps particularly striking that they also show deaf ears to industry, investors, businesses, the productive fabric of this country, from the third energy sector to the automotive industry, which see in electrification, efficiency, digitalisation the keys to sustainability in the time of each of their sectors; the primary sector or the tourism sector, which in the first line of the coast, depending on water and time, is already suffering from changes in climate change. No, ladies and gentlemen, there is no climate alarmism or a new religion, as the parliamentary group that has convened this debate points out in the introduction to its amendment. It is pure physics and chemistry, alien to ideologies and religions. No, ladies and gentlemen, the IPCC forecasts are neither alarmist nor denied over and over again by reality, as you say. On the contrary, they are unfortunately confirmed by the facts and the change of weather patterns settled in time. On the contrary, quite the contrary, the question of national survival is not to reject this law, but to take the climate threat seriously, more at a critical time for our country in which we are discussing together what model we want, what we need to carry forward, what we need to adapt to be more resilient to emerging risks. The recovery phase we are in represents a propitious moment for a change of course and the next decade is key to the transition. The Government brings to the House a project that responds to the warnings of science and to the demands of society; a very participatory, solid, comprehensive, fair and balanced project; a bill that offers an institutional response consistent with the challenge posed by the climate emergency and with the aim of achieving emission neutrality in Spain no later than 2050, as we have committed ourselves to Europe and the world. You, ladies and gentlemen, are called to improve it, to strengthen it, but you are confused if you think it is patriotic to reject it or, as you point out in your amendment to the whole, to return this law is a matter of national survival. We cannot ignore the warnings of science; on the contrary, we must integrate them into decision-making in a timely and effective manner. We cannot shut down decisions that affect our health and well-being from those that affect the environment. We cannot be defeated by short-term options that ignore environmental costs and compromise our future capital. Anticipation, based on scientific knowledge, and the application of the precautionary principle must be our response to the uncertainties and challenges we face. Therefore, we want to bet on a change in the productive, energy and consumption model that strengthens the industrial and business fabric, generates decent employment and reduces inequalities, allows us to live in more habitable, safe and healthy cities, empowers and recognizes the value of sustainable rural development, protects biodiversity, our ecosystems and our health; they are compatible and complementary objectives. The text presented today by the Government puts on the table principles and concrete solutions that show how the action of State institutions can have a real transformative role for society in the short, medium and long term. Betting on climate action is betting on our economy and social progress. The commitment to the environment is aimed precisely at preventing society and businesses from unabated costs arising from environmental degradation and the impacts of climate change. Different economic actors, companies, international bodies such as the OECD, the European Union, the International Monetary Fund, the International Energy Agency or the World Economic Forum stress the imperative of a green and inclusive economic recovery; the proposals of the European Commission and the European Central Bank are working in this direction. The European Green Pact becomes the pillar of the recovery strategy for a Europe that is preparing to generate opportunities for the next generation. It is no coincidence that energy and climate policies are a clean engine of economic growth. In terms of GDP, value added, wealth generation and employment, all proposed measures and impact projections are positive; it is estimated that two or three of these developments can be returned for each euro invested. Leaving fossil fuels behind and replacing them with renewable energy generates skilled employment and strengthens our business and industrial fabric both in the production of equipment and services goods and in the energy savings it entails, liberating resources for more innovation, more entrepreneurship, more training and more solidarity. The deployment of renewables will also help to meet the challenges of emptied Spain and the depopulation of rural areas, bringing territorial balance. The proper management of water, soil, coastline, introduction and recovery of value in our economy will preserve its potential and articulate new industrial and service sources for employment and wealth generation. Housing rehabilitation, investment in infrastructure that requires sustainable mobility, ecological restoration and the promotion of ecosystem-based adaptation and recalibration of infrastructure to adapt to new climate scenarios are also sources of economic development and job creation. This law provides a framework for industrial modernization and innovation, a reference for solid infrastructure and, above all, for working together to build a better country. Thanks to the energy transition, thanks to climate action and the expansion of renewables, our economy will be more competitive, reducing energy costs will generate savings for families, increasing disposable income and promoting wealth distribution, while facilitating innovation in industrial processes and services in many sectors. All these investments, as I said, have a powerful multiplier effect on GDP and employment. They're not chimeras. As Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz or economist Nicholas Stern point out, green projects compatible with the fight against climate change create more jobs, generate more short-term return per euro invested and bring greater long-term savings than traditional fiscal stimulus measures, and it is time for Spain to benefit from all the potential this offers. The law, aligned with the objectives of the green pact and the European recovery framework, will help us get out of the crisis, proud to know that we are nurturing the future of young people. They have heard me say repeatedly in this House and in other forums that we must put the future of our young people at the centre of our response to the current crisis and to the systemic crises that generate climate change and the loss of biodiversity, and it is that to a similar conclusion the Banco de España comes, in whose report on intergenerational labour trends in Spain in the last decades, published last May, underlines the disturbing prospects that the lack of adequate response generates for the under thirty-five years. It is our greatest responsibility, to turn events around and offer solvent answers. This commitment to our present and future is reflected in the very purpose of the law: to facilitate the Spanish economy to be emission neutral, to promote the implementation of a model of sustainable development that is resilient to the negative impacts of climate change. The project that I am presenting to you today has different objectives. The first is to establish a predictable framework, to send out a clear signal to induce climate action and to attract investment into the productive economy and the infrastructures and services that welcome us in our daily activity and well-being. To this end, quantified targets are set for both 2050 and 2030, which can only be revised upwards, as proposed by us. Complying with the Paris agreement, the law is set to achieve emission neutrality by 2050. Much sooner our electricity system will have to be 100 percent renewable and much more involved, placing the citizen at the centre and posing interesting technological, innovation and market challenges and opportunities. The law also sets national targets by 2030 of binding compliance consistent with the increased ambition set by the European Union and with the Paris agreement, which requires us to present new revised commitments upwards in this year 2020. In 2030, therefore, we propose that Spain reduce its emissions by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels, which represents slightly more than 33% of current emissions. For this year 35% of the final energy consumption will be renewable, 70% of the energy generated by the country will be renewable, and with this objective, we think, will be activated the deployment of clean energies, which are already the cheapest source today. It is an industry that will act as a lever in recovery and it is important that it does not lose the speed it has been acquiring. Also by 2030 we will have significantly increased our energy efficiency, that is, we will have reduced the amount of energy we need to produce goods and services. The aim is to reduce primary energy consumption by at least 35% thanks to efficiency measures, which are particularly important and have a great social impact when it comes to the building rehabilitation sector, another important vector of stable and future employment generation, as I say, with great advantages from the point of view of social impact. We need to facilitate the survival of industrial and economic sectors by adapting them to new challenges and demands in order to lead international markets for clean technologies, and we are well positioned. Spain has patents on innovations, equipment assets and complete value chains. There is a need to mobilize all available resources for technologies that generate employment and sustained progress over time. Resources need to be led for industrial innovation in materials, in services, in clean energy. This explains why fossil fuels must have a specific treatment in the law, which allows us to leave behind their use. They have contributed enormously to progress for decades, but today we know that their side effects force us to facilitate the entry of alternatives and the progressive exit of their weight into the economy. It won't be overnight, but it's also not responsible to look elsewhere and let it happen alone. The planning of energy and climate policy, facilitating anticipation, the identification of objectives, scenarios; understanding, anticipating and promoting where we are, where we want to be and how we can reach it is the second of the objectives set by the law through the forecasting and regulation of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan and the decarbonization strategy by 2050, both of which are the tools of the Community framework in which we operate. They will have to collect sectoral objectives and policies and measures to achieve them, ensuring that all sectors of the economy participate and contribute in advance in the process of decarbonisation and resilience of our economy, both the sectors covered by the European trading and emission rights regime, large industries, the electricity sector, and the diffuse sectors: agriculture, forestry, transport, residential, institutional and fluorinated gases. A third extremely important objective is to facilitate the correct identification of the main decarbonisation tools. Here the common recipe in our environment goes through the deployment of renewables, the boost to energy efficiency and sustainable mobility and electrification of end-uses. In the energy part the law contains different elements, many of which we have had to anticipate in Decree-Law 23/2020 that I will present to validation before this plenary tomorrow. It includes the enabling of a new auction framework for renewables that allows us to anticipate and benefit from the reduction of their costs at a time like this. It includes the definition of new figures in the regulation of the electricity sector, such as storage, independent demand aggregator or hybridization; the extension of the National Energy Efficiency Fund until 2030; the promotion of renewable gases, such as biogas, biomethane and hydrogen, key to the decarbonization of industry and an important potential in our country for large renewable hydrogen generators at competitive prices. It also includes enabling the Government to require regulated actors in the energy system, the market operator, the system operator, the carrier and distributors to develop and present decarbonisation strategies within their scope of action. The significance in the economy of these actors does not allow us to run the risk that they have not foreseen, anticipated and prepared sufficiently in advance the evolution they are facing. In the area of energy efficiency, the law also sends out a signal that sets medium-term targets and links the long-term strategy for building renovation, ensuring coherence between the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan and urban rehabilitation. And in promoting sustainable mobility, progress is being made on different lines of work: by 2050 we will have to reach a fleet of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles without direct CO2 emissions; in line with European standards, social demand and technological development, by no later than 2040 the vehicles will have to be zero grams of CO2 per kilometre travelled. Industry in our country must lead the future of sustainable mobility with the necessary support, and not remain anchored in technologies without looking, without evolving in the direction that the regulatory frameworks mark but also the demand that they face. We will have to work in the urban transformation, and the municipalities of more than 50 000 inhabitants, the islands will establish low-emission zones no later than 2023 to facilitate walking, cycling or other means, improving public transport and adapting to what has already become an increasingly frequent and intense reality in European capitals. Urban adaptation to the scene of new normality requires giving more space to pedestrians and cyclists and facilitating safe mobility and coexistence in public space. The deployment of charging infrastructure at certain service stations or on the public road obliges us to establish a minimum of charging points, which is expected to be extended as electric mobility gains market share; to facilitate the detection of charging infrastructure, a national access point is established. Finally, we cannot forget air and sea transport, facilitating its progressive decarbonisation and actions at ports and airports linked to reducing emissions from ships and aircraft when they are moored. The fourth objective is to build climate resilience, how to make a country safer and able to anticipate the risks of climate change. For the first time the law incorporates the need to activate policies to adapt to the climate risks with which we already live. It is such an important area of action as mitigation, such as emission reduction. It is essential to reduce the vulnerability of society and the economy to the impacts of climate change, to territorial vertebration and to social cohesion in our country. The essential elements of the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan are regulated for the first time, such as the identification of objectives and their basic content. Their approval, approval and further development should be made in accordance with the various work programmes that are being agreed in each critical sector. But the most important thing is that it is addressed with a sectoral treatment, identifying some of the key areas, such as hydrological management, coastal, territorial and urban planning, building and infrastructure, agrarian, forestry and, of course, biodiversity conservation. This sectoral treatment ensures the integration of the horizontal adaptation perspective in key areas for economic and social development and in sectors vulnerable to impacts, according to climate projections and scenarios. It also includes elements necessary to strengthen our response, research, development, science, observation, the establishment of a system of indicators of impacts and adaptation to climate change that facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of public policies, as well as their success and impact, and includes the need to draw up regular risk reports on decision-making by public officials who can guide public and private sector investments. What is not measured or known is not improved or managed, and therefore we need to follow up. The fifth objective of the law is to provide a compact view of the social dimension in the transformation policies of our system, solve short-term problems, while preparing professional skills and acquiring knowledge for today's and tomorrow's job demands. On the one hand, we have a fair transition and, on the other, education and training for employment. The project envisages instruments to ensure that the transition leaves no one behind, fair transition strategies or fair transition agreements that determine with all local actors instruments to ensure employability and the generation of new economic opportunities in areas affected by the transformation, as is already the case with the closure of coal mines and thermal power plants. And in education we want to promote the inclusion of environmental education in curricula and training catalogues, relying on training in future jobs, young people having employment opportunities and an improved career, adapted to the demands of society on a regular basis. The sixth objective is to improve the weight of national accounting and the assessment of public and private spending, as well as investment decisions and their compatibility with climate risks, a State administration consistent with new requirements in the development of legislation, taking into account from now on the impact of climate change in terms of mitigation and adaptation in the use of revenues obtained through the auction of allowances, in the evaluation of bids in public procurement or in the search for solutions to international financing and our models of development cooperation. In particular, it is proposed, inter alia, that the percentage of the general budgets of the State contributing to the climate and energy objectives be equivalent to that agreed within the multiannual financial framework of the European Union. It is proposed to review fossil fuel subsidies or also, depending on the risk dimension in each of the private sector's decisions, to facilitate decision makers and business strategies to understand and share information in a transparent manner as to what their exposure to climate risk represents for the financial sector and large companies. To this end, an obligation is introduced to submit an annual report on non-financial reporting obligations, assessing the financial impact of the risks associated with climate change generated by the exposure of its activity, including risks in a context of transition to a sustainable economy and the measures taken to address those risks; nothing new, many other countries in our environment are doing so and we already have an important body of reference in the European and international financial sector. Financial institutions should publish specific decarbonisation targets for their loan and investment portfolio aligned with the Paris Agreement from 2023, an international agreement ratified by this House incorporating the obligation that all financial flows be progressively compatible with the fight against climate change and compliance with climate neutrality and security by 2050. The Banco de España, the CNMV and the Directorate-General for Insurance and Pension Funds will draw up a report on the risk assessment for the Spanish financial system derived from climate change on a regular basis and will send it to their colleagues. The last of the dimensions of this bill aims to improve governance through the establishment of a committee of experts and the promotion of public participation in climate matters; an independent committee responsible for evaluating and making recommendations on energy and climate change policies and measures, including regulations, which will have to prepare an annual report to be submitted to and discussed by the Congress of Deputies with the participation of the Government. In short, with this project we present an institutional framework for coordinated action to facilitate in a predictable way the progressive adaptation of the country's reality to the requirements that regulate climate action. In other words, conditions are laid down to achieve climate neutrality in advance, offering certainty to all public and private actors, facilitating spaces for debate, improvement and periodic updating. I would say, ladies and gentlemen, that Spain complies with this law; it fulfils as a country, increasing its contribution to the fight against climate change, as we committed ourselves to ratifying the Paris Agreement; it fulfils the ambition that Europe has set itself, since we want to be a neutral continent in emissions no later than 2050; it fulfils the international community, facilitating the multilateral response of all countries to ensure that the planet moves as quickly as possible and with the necessary capabilities towards a decarbonized economy, but the most important thing is that it gives answers to the demands of Spanish society, which demands immediate action, without neglecting intergenerational social justice, accompanying the most vulnerable groups in the present and with the gaze placed on future generations, to which we cannot bequeath the mortgage of an unstable climate. We offer a flexible framework, but committed to the generations of today and tomorrow. That is why I ask your ladies and gentlemen to make this proposal yours, to work on it, to improve it and to facilitate its rapid adoption and its validity. Thank you very much.

The construction of a sustainable transport system for the future requires a wide range of different mobility options, as what works at the same time may not be possible elsewhere. In cities it is best to travel in public, walking and cycling. Longer journeys are the most comfortable and ecological way to travel by train. In sub-regions and rural areas, there is a need for functional parking and charging points for electric and biogas cars. About one fifth of all emissions in Finland are generated by transport, and that is why we Greens are calling for such ambitious reductions in emissions in transport. Finland's target of halving transport emissions by 2030 is just the way we are heading towards the first carbon-neutral welfare state in the world. The improvement of the transport system is an important part of this package, and at best sustainable forms of mobility make transport services available to more and more Finns. This week Parliament was briefed on the annual climate report, according to which emissions from domestic transport fell by six per cent in 2020 compared to the previous year. This was particularly affected by corona pandemic, as the kilometres driven decreased sharply. Mr President! The message of the Annual Climate Report is clear: carbon neutrality in 2035 will require further urgent action even after the pandemic. If it is not possible to cut emissions from traffic, it must be done from somewhere else. In these efforts, each sector must play its part. The Greens' starting point throughout the Transport 12 work has been that the preparation of the transport system plan must go hand in hand with the road map for fossil-free transport and the reform of taxes and charges for sustainable transport. The Committee on Transport and Communications also stresses this in its report. It is clear that the transport system can no longer rely on fossil fuels in the 2030s. We must not only electrify transport in a sustainable way but also increase the share of bio-based fuels in transport. In terms of nature or the climate, it does not matter how and from where biofuels for transport are produced. Whether we use virgin biomass or whether we talk about, for example, fourth generation carbon neutral biofuels and circular economy — the differences in the environmental impact of fuels can be great. Mr President! Transport sustainability, energy efficiency and accessibility of regions. These are the main objectives we set in the steering group for this plan. They bind the development of the transport system across party boundaries and over parliamentary term. We are committed to these objectives together. If this parliamentary, careful preparation is not to be wasted, the Government must genuinely commit itself to the guidelines of the national transport system plan. This means, among other things, that the appropriations necessary to implement the plan will be taken into account in the budgetary plans and in the state budget proposals. In its report, the committee rightly draws attention to the greatest challenge of transport policy, namely financing. It is important that the proposed co-financing model does not alter the basic principles of the financial responsibilities of transport projects. Contract cooperation between the state and municipalities must continue to rely on trust and partnership with a view to building a better transport system for the common good. Another major challenge for transport policy has been the lack of long-term sustainability. The transport system plan also provides solutions for this. The Committee stresses the use of new services and digitalisation in the further development of the transport system. The world around us is changing rapidly and so is transport and the need for mobility. The transport system plan must be adapted as new, more sustainable modes of mobility emerge. Mr President! Social and territorial justice are the cornerstones of fair change and have also been taken into account in the planning of the transport system, and this must continue to be the case. In addition to climate change, we must actively combat transport poverty. People must be able to move to the services within a reasonable time, with reasonable effort and cost, regardless of the income level or postal code. We Greens want more and more Finns to be able to choose a train as their means of transport instead of the most polluting alternatives. Workable and well-served rail transport is therefore a key element of a sustainable transport system. Mr President! We warmly support the objectives of the national transport system plan in the Green Parliamentary Group, and as a member of the steering group I would like to thank you again for your cooperation and wish everyone a good summer on behalf of the Green Parliamentary Group."", ""A respectable president. There's a second round here. for a long term transport program on a committee committee. There is a detailed perspective along with a change in a greater part of the Environment and Transport Committee, which is the opinion and proposed changes I support. Then I too supported and shared in making adjustments. paritaprevir Jón Gunnarsson set out for the day. 890. The nominee is a proposal for the resolution of a five-year transport programme for 2019◯023, which is a plan of action. The Commission then deals with the proposal to consecrate transport programmes for the 2019-2333 period, and that is the 15 - year plan. I'm going to start with killing on a number of things, both in the Commission opinion and in the suggestions they made in the fall. In summary, the contribution of the majority of the Committee is due to the proposed minor changes in implementation for 2019 and 2020, leading primarily to changes in the progress of the road generation. In addition, proposals are offered to continue working on transport expenditure. There is no suggestion on the extraction, which is what I'm about to start reading, but I have to take a little more time to find it. I'd like to be surprised by the misunderstanding presented in some cases about the President's conference board. Although more money is being given in transportation than ever before, visitors met up with the committee that it was not enough. If we are to reach an acceptable location for security, environment, transportation, and transport, we must find ways to speed up projects in the coming years. This means that there are other methods of financing other than those currently available. As I have previously stated from this platform, I do not get tired of achieving that transportation is important and affecting everyone. They are the largest community, as well as health, education, welfare, environment, culture, and employment. In fact, for decades we have been focusing on ever improving transport across the country, I believe that one of the important reasons that we have made a success of building up the well - being we live in here is the only reason we have been able to live in this country. The plan we are discussing was and is fully funded in financial planning and more money is estimated to the road system than ever before. Yet, the conclusion of conversation with the members of the Committee is that there are too many years until we reach an acceptable location in the maintenance and innovation of the road system. In fact, no matter what part of the land, territory, or roads are considered. The work of winter has taught me that we have to find ways to travel faster than financial resources allow us to do so, and for this, there is certainly more than one way. When a transport program was submitted, the secretary of transport, including the secretary of transport, was introduced. working on a full reimbursement of the road system and estimated that the transport bill would be submitted by spring. In these policies it is important to focus on the overall picture, the impact of energy exchange, the ways to speed up progress and control traffic. We are at a critical milestone, and it is important that we discuss these events at the same time. The export is so important that there will be equality and transparency in the implementation and use of funds, as well as technical instruments. It is important, then, that public and possibly specific remuneration, such as taxation, do not add a charge to individuals beyond the benefits that individuals enjoy from better roads. Over it went wrong. paritaprevir Ari Trausti Guðmundsson very well. When reimbursement is completed, new transport plans and rapid implementations, now in the second and third periods according to priorities in the 15 year schedule, and when projects associated with the urban line have been prioritised, both those already planned and those who may be added. In the Committee, the more part will depend on the purpose of the transport plan, i.e. The aim of transportation to be easy, safe, economic and environmental sustainable and clear targets for positive urban development was not established by the Committee to criticize those objectives. Visitors before the committee were unanimous about the need for action and maintenance in all groups of roads. A accumulated problem would be great and insist that the speed of construction be exceeded. Iceland is populated, and the road system is extensive, and its structure has always been much behind neighboring countries. The overall need for investment is 3,350,400 billion. Of course, we have to look for a number of tourists to be multiplied in recent years as well as for the development and development of industry to require more use on the road system. Work territory is increasing, and urban areas are increasing. Therefore, I believe that there will be a rapid response to the problems that have been raised over the past few years, and I have been determined to improve the road and transportation system as rapidly as possible in terms of the practicality, climate targets, equality and safety issues. It has been noted that according to Iceland's Economic Institute for Economic Growth, economic growth declines as early as this year. Thus, there are ideal conditions to enter the infrastructure and thereby build up for progress in social and economic affairs in the country. I'm going to keep further coverage on the road system and I'm gonna go to public transportation and start there on the city line. As we have seen, we are at a critical time. We are developing significant changes in transport, and as reflected in a special discussion of the city line last week, there has been extensive agreements between the state and the local community in the capital area to shape plans for the forward development of transportation in the capital area. Certain stages have been reached in the work together, and there is a declaration of will, but more work is ahead of us. Travel habits have been changed so that more people use public transportation, wheels, or walk more automobiles, however, by 24% to 2033. If travel habits do not change much more, or up to 40%, the transport rate will increase. Thus, it is very important for all who travel across the capital area to develop a transport system that ensures easy and secure traffic with the least environmental impact, regardless of the way humans choose. This requires a definition of road transport with the emphasis on public transportation, walk-and-wheel footpaths, as well as the car traffic. All these routes need to be well connected between areas and those of the stockways outside the capital. Public transport in the country must form a unit on land, in the air, and at sea. The city line is a basis for real choice of public transportation in the capital area, i.e. there is a high quality system separated from another traffic. In order to meet the need for further changes in transport programmes, it is certain that the planning and implementation needed between 2019 and 2020 will ensure that cooperation can provide further definitions of the project, common objectives and funding will be implemented in order to achieve further priorities, which would then be ready for a further review of transport plans later in this year. But then public transportation outside the capital area. It was noted to the Committee that great noises were on the implementation of public transport within and between parts of the country. In my opinion, that situation has lasted as long as the oldest men will, since we tried to establish public transportation. In 2012, treaties between the road generation and the national part of the network began to allow them to receive the money previously set aside in the districts to organize public transport in their part of the country. The work was widely carried out, and the number of passengers increased by about tens of them. As progress continued, the business began to grow quickly, and they have been growing. The number of passengers has decreased as a result of lack of financial resources and problems has been observed, including ... whereauthority has not been established, and other operators have actually blown a cream off the road and have been missing the system all over the country. Thus, the entire organization has issued its contract, but temporary resolution has been completed in 2019 and the development of a complete policy in land, air, and sea transport is now being developed. That is the key to building a future arrangement. One of the possibilities that the national part of the network has been considering is the willingness to establish one common society to hold on to public transport in the national stocks. A new arrangement is scheduled for the next year. It was explained to the committee's meeting of the importance of national flights to Northern, Eastern, and Western countries. A greater proportion of them will agree with the aim of a transport program that allows citizens of the country to reach the capital area over about three and a half hours of integrated travel time. Then I'm just gonna get in touch with my country partner and the Road Make-up. It was found that relationships between road generation and rural society need to be established in a fixed format so that specific protocols will be established in order to ensure close consultation between the road generation and rural society in order to prioritate projects, plan and implementation, agreed on the requirements for e.g. Service, such as snowcapped, slippery, and deep watering projects at ports, and other factors might be counted. Part of what has been said there is that road service in most of the rural areas is really not the same as getting people into the urban area without exception. A lot of traffic security has been discussed in connection with priorities, but traffic security is all over the top of the section and is being discussed. I'd like to introduce a point of view about the safety of young traffic that we received a special presentation on, that it was worth considering the way drivers are taking their first steps in traffic, going on their way to high school. There are many dangerous places where youths have been gathering. We received young advice from the Southnes, who discussed the subject with us, and this was an interesting discussion. This made it clear that winter service is a key factor in the traffic security of this group, as well as the driving of all other groups. The majority agree on traffic security. Also, I would like to agree with the 15 - year plan to ensure the correct and consistent registration of transport accidents, which I believe are significantly lacking. Much is yet to come, but the talk period is getting shorter. I think I'll take the next flight. The number of flights in Iceland has increased over a few years, so air security has never been more important and much more important to us than just a short time ago, such as the setting for teaching flights in which a growing group operates on flights in Iceland. There has been an extensive development at the Cheflaví airport, but there has been significant reductions in donations for building at other airports. To ensure their ability to serve as a reserve airport for a growing flight to and from the country, therefore, it is very important to improve the network of international airports. At the beginning of December 2018, the task force returned a report. The group was assigned to offer suggestions to change the management of international flights with the aim of achieving a more efficient international approach and a more efficient flight route management, which yields to consumers. At the same time, a proposal to make the international flight a practical advantage for the inhabitants of the country and to continue to be inhabited throughout the country. In short, the committee agrees with the suggestions offered by the staff and suggests that adjustments are made in the direction of their implementation. It consists of the international airports, the Cheflavour Airport, the Eagle Island Airport, and the Lampground Airport being defined as a system of flights with a common base of cost, and Isavia entrusted financial responsibility for operating, maintenance, and building. By doing so, Istavia can contribute and collect services according to the financial cost of the system's operation. The Ministry of Transport and Regional Affairs should initiate a discussion with Istavia about changes in the service contract taking into account the new arrangements and measures needed, such as increasing the volume of the flying system while maintaining the required service level. At the same time, negotiations between the Department of Transport and the Ministry of Economic and Economic Affairs will be rejected for the shape of the Istavia ownership policy as agreed by the government's agreement. That approach, I think, is very important. At the same time, the new management structure of these flights has to lead to the maintenance and renewal of the 2020-2023 projections on the international airport and other flying systems in the bases where maintenance and renewal have become urgent, including the need for a return to the network. Based on safety considerations. It is also important to find ways within the Istavia service contract to respond to the need for superficial maintenance and to increase the need for the reception of passengers on a international flight to Akureyri. This needs to be done immediately this year. Then, in the opinion of the committee, what is actually presented in the program, as it was suggested, is that Reykjavík's airports need to be maintained and built up to the point that he performs the role he requires in a safe and acceptable manner until a comparable reconstituted solution is found, transporting the airfield from the Hydrosm. Then, as mentioned earlier, it is important to connect the airport to other public transportation. The structure of the national airport can contribute to the growth of the distribution of tourists across the country. It enhances the facilities for teaching, guarantees many security, such as by means of a medical flight, and in other ways. It is finally time for a talk. In the next talk, I will include. deals with subsidies on domestic flights and road projects."", ""V.E.G. President. We'll discuss a future transport program, one on five years of transport, and then a multi-annual arrangement for a 15-year transport program in 2019-52033. There has been a great debate in society over transport and mainly on the ideas of remuneration and how we see changes in the economics of the future. Many times, I feel that the discussion has come quite far from what is discussed here, i.e. from the transport program we're setting up here. In the opinion of the greater part of the arraignment. The environment and transport committees are certainly expressed as terms of remuneration in relation to an important project that is requested to speed up, but they are actually just at the level of ideas. These are changes in the progress of projects for the next two years, the development of projects, and the budget between periods, which, of course, step forward but, in itself, are less variable when considering. No matter where the discussion of transport is covered, the reviews on this big issue and on the case of the committee's guest, that action is needed in road work on all parts of the country, both that are involved in the maintenance and implementation of all roads, as it is said, and it is also considered extremely important to increase the pace of the projects we see ahead of time in the programmes we are considering. A cumulative problem is great and has occurred in recent years. In the wake of the collapse, financial contributions to the seminary and financing were not in accordance with the need at all. Thus, to form winter services and road markings, a gathering of country's maintenance needs is a great need, as well as a need for new and expanding services. During the same period, traffic has increased substantially, including Due to the increased number of tourists, but last year's traffic increased by 11%. As a result, the demand for easy and safe transport has increased substantially throughout the year, and it constantly makes for greater success. About this position all political groups were aware of over a year in their campaigns and the highest. Government and supreme. A secretary of transportation, Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson, has certainly set in motion a significant improvement in the seminary and will launch into the necessary structure, necessary new projects, such as twice the capital and the capital areas, through the Westway, through Kjalarnes, on the Southland road, on the Smokey Way, but at the expense of them alone, some 60 billion dollars are considered. In comparison, the 2019 transport funds are nearly 42 billion. With that amount of money, it takes 10 years to meet the estimated total investment needs, and it shows up in the members' list of the total holdings of the sector, 3,50,4400 billion bucks. It's a simple balance bill that I cross over to control, for of course it's not that simple, because all projects bring up expensive maintenance. It's a lot of money, a respectable president, and I think we have to bury the discussion. As noted, Iceland is a rural country, so the road system is vast, compared with the population population and we don't live anywhere near neighboring countries. To figure out the scope, consider the 2017 GPA. This first-time road system, in addition to some of the dockers, is introduced into the process of international accounts allowing for, i.e. to make investments in transport edifications. The road system is thus moved into the books of the Roadmaking and then moved as part of the holdings of a government fund and is evaluated by groups with varying lengths of extensions, but major groups are considered for possession, such as. Lands and fills, subsidies, farms, and fences. In addition, there are sewers, signs, and carved gates, along with corridors and bridges, so it is pretty well listed in the individual property. It says that a reevaluation of the founding value of the road system is some 800 billion dollars. and the unwritten portion of that 565 billion francs. For 2017, copies were 9.4 billion. Such accounting is a big step forward, providing a clearer picture of the composition and the appropriate scope, and especially the need for the maintenance that is made up of such assets. The pressures on the system have increased, and heavy shipments have increased - the greater the number of cars, the greater the number of road breaks - and the number of tourists traveling around. Jóhannes Þór Skúlason, director of the Association for travel service, has pointed out, and rightly so, that in recent years, tourism and the increase make it possible for a discussion of speedy progress and the level of projects to be funded faster and earlier. He points out, as many have done on the Havenan tunnel to support it, but it was paid earlier than anticipated, but less than 3 million road users pass the road but not 340,000. We tend to talk about this growth in a negative tone, in terms of growth, but I don't think that's the case. Of course, we rejoice in the growth and prosperity of the article, and it is vital that we achieve a solidarity in the process of making progress, with a specific exchange if necessary. It is important to achieve a solidarity over such things. It is important that we provide these ideas in this regard in order to facilitate traffic and to increase traffic security and thus speed up projects. Because I mention the tourism service here, it must be prepared properly in cooperation with the sector, but one of the nuclear factors in tourism is transportation. I rejoice, therefore, that the organization of tourism is taking the initiative to work out solutions with the government. The transport services organization has already taken the initiative to cooperate with the transport and rural management department for these factors and is not advisable unless the time is taken. It may be most important, before the beginning, if ideas of rapid implementation become reality, to give everyone the opportunity to realize things and work together in such solutions so as to make peace with such decisions and to make them work. In fact, I feel as if the number of road costs, increase taxation, and the extra taxation of automobile owners has exceeded the proposals we discuss in this transport program, while at the same time in the leading branch section, it can address that these ideas can be established before careful implementation of a specific bill from the highest level. A secretary of transportation will be here for the council. For transport funding, energy exchange and future development need to be considered and taken into account. It has to be that we will not be left behind with such transitions when the income of gasoline and oil costs inevitably fall together, and the revenues will be down to the effort to take place, for what we have seen before in the past decade is that the problem will increase to the future and we will not be able to reach the tail with the abundant need for maintenance, let alone obtaining needed needs and urgent innovations within the time frame called. Thus, it must be possible to agree with the trial presented in the leading committee list by permission of the president: ▪ The more part feels that there will be a rapid response to the problems raised over the past few years that will be targeted at improving road and transport as rapidly as possible in terms of the practicality, climate targets, equality, and security issues. It is important to look for ways to speed up the most urgent road to transport. More is being done here than making up what everyone agrees to do, the transport program before the council. It also points out that based on economic growth, it is less relaxed to develop in the economy, which causes situations to be carried out without stability and the demand for normal economic growth to be disturbed, thus building on economic and economic economic economic economic growth in the country. Under these circumstances, a respectable president can be taken. The majority, in turn, take an important and convincing argument that it may be wise to speed up the process being proclaimed in a transport program, which suggests that it is wise to make progress. on the commitment between Iceland and climate change, the importance of energy exchange, which is designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as it says. Thus, specific currency, moderate tax costs, can speed up the progress of such projects into better, more efficient roads, thus driving and driving with less spending and cost. Perhaps it is most important to consider the overall price exchange, the general expenditures such as oil and gasoline, and the price of automobiles, i.e. that there is no excess in the benefits of such projects. Such an overall review is inevitable until later, that work is already under way under government guidance. The schedule is now, in contrast with what has often been done, in accordance with budget, policy, and therefore is up - to - date and there are no changes between discussions. Is it good and positive that the government budget is working in the process of communicating plans, that there is a harmonization between policy plans, implementation and funding, as agreed upon when these laws were adopted here at the General Assembly, i.e. of long - term thinking, stability and discipline in the implementation of budgets, as well as the trust of the International Parliament to set the goals of government and government funds that are fundamental to the making of budgets. The current plan, as it is available here, is fully in line with an agreed financial programme at the highest level. Governments. And if such ideas are needed, they must be done more quickly and they need to be thought of other ways to do so. There is nothing wrong with discussing it, as the discussion has been, setting the basis for such discussions, as is done here on the part of the section, and in full agreement with the work as the highest level. A minister has started with groups of work to recommend solutions and to discuss the challenges facing everyone in transport. In fact, it's exemplary, I mean, looking to the future and thinking in terms of the present challenges as well as discussing it with the council, through the process. Environmental and transport committees, in relation to the transport programme as it has been done, in order to ensure the establishment of the Council as necessary. It is well built, and on this basis the more part contributes to a change in policy objective for a five - year transport program, making it clear that a new financing process will continue to be accomplished. This will be done by a special bill that will appear before the council and, of course, must submit to the laws we have set for government policy and planning. A respectable president. Each of us agrees on the importance of speed-up projects to improve driving safety. And here we need to assess the benefits for car owners or road users beyond the expenses they require, assess the costs accordingly to the individual and to society. I rejoice at the emphasis made by the greater part and must express myself as a Southwestern senator that it is urgent to try out on every route and with all means to complete earlier with the Elphani's final legion, the leg between the Stepway and the Breinholt Way, which has been repeatedly delayed, and must be completed sooner than in the original program. The design and design are completed, as mentioned in a committee list, and there are mainly safety reasons there and increasing traffic that weigh heavily. There is a delay in response due to medical transport, and fireman's demand is inadequate, and there is an urgent improvement to be made and with all available measures to speed up. In Kópavogi, the east of the country is rapidly built, and the community has done well in the general service that has been carried out. There is now an abundance of flourishing areas and a blending of jobs in the lakelands. Traffic through the waterfront today is cracked, and we feel it well in times of stress - many of which are busy, over 12,000 cars per day. [[Up front.]] The majority of them focus on promoting public transport by land, air, and sea throughout the country, covering the situation and developing later years, and testifying even. to work in 2018 at the Department of Transport and Regional Affairs to shape the overall policy of public transportation. I'm celebrating the work as the highest. A minister has established a city line as part of a public transportation. There is an important step in the organization of transportation within the capital area, a system reported from another traffic. It is important to import it, create a future structure and a declaration and consult the rural areas in the capital area and the State in order to improve options, reduce predictable traffic expansion and the environmental impact. There's a good report behind these traffic plans. If nothing has to be done, things will get worse. I also welcome the work as the highest. A minister has arranged for a group of personnel to operate on air transport. Hv. paritaprevir That work has been covered by Njáll Friðbertsson, who studied the flight program in his earlier speech and, in particular, the domestic flight as a practical option for the inhabitants of the country. The inquisitive route was mentioned, but to her we have spoken and hoped that it will become a reality, as foretold. But it's moving fast. Actually, I didn't mean to talk for so long, a respectable president, but it's a big deal and a lot to talk about. I want to be at the end of this article to point to the obvious subject behind this important subject and plan: In all coverage and work, we have a problem. The Environment and Transport Committee did a very good job. I thank you for the careful work and the foundation for the discussion we've been through here. I agree with what. My associate, Anna Sævarsdóttir, who's sitting on the bed. Environment and transport committees and have worked hard and hard on this committee's list of aspects. It often speaks of transportation as being about many things and touching our whole community. They are the largest community in the world, health, education, sports, welfare; environment, culture, and are huge, natural, professional. Emphasis on natural and safe transport around the country is the key to using resources around the country, promoting a wide range of employment, and thus building under the well - being and standard of living that we have blessed with a relatively rapid improvement. In spite of everything, at least in international comparison, I'm talking about standard of living. Then we must have been able to do some good about transportation, but we want to do better. We have extra stress to deal with. To cope with climate change, we have made international commitments. All this matters. A respectable president. It is important that we accept this transport program as proposed and then accept the discussion of change of budget and future changes that will take into account these factors and the urgency of projects. Let us continue this discussion and try to make the most of it.""]","<|system|>

The policies that flow from the Bill seek to strengthen our agricultural and horticultural industries and protect the long-term future of food production in this country. They will help deliver a fairer return from a fairer marketplace for food producers Financial assistance will be provided for protecting or improving the environment and will allow the environmental land management—ELM—scheme to provide financial assistance for the delivery of outcomes such as cleaner air and water and thriving plants and wildlife. The Government will also provide financial support in connection with managing land or water to help mitigate flooding. There will also be support for action to improve animal health and welfare, reduce endemic disease, keep livestock and soils healthy, and support public access to and enjoyment of the countryside. Farmers and land managers will be rewarded for their vital work in enhancing our environment and looking after our landscapes The Government and food producers have important contributions to make when it comes to tackling climate change. These provisions will put our farmers at the heart of an ambitious enterprise: to meet the goals of the 25-year environment plan and achieve the Government’s world-leading commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. The National Farmers Union has already shown admirable leadership in its work on seeking net-zero emissions The Bill recognises at its heart that food production and a flourishing natural environment can—and must—go hand in hand. This is explicitly demonstrated in Clause 1(4), which places a duty on the Secretary of State to have regard to the need to encourage the production of food by producers in England, and in an environmentally sustainable way, when framing financial assistance schemes. It includes provisions for financial assistance to encourage farmers, foresters and growers to improve their productivity in a sustainable way. The Government will provide grants so that they can invest in equipment, technology and infrastructure I know that Ministers sometimes receive reports from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee with some trepidation, but I am most grateful to—indeed, I thank—the committee for its consideration of the Bill, its overwhelmingly positive report and its commentary on an improvement to an earlier Bill. Of course, we will consider closely any residual issues and concerns raised by the committee In setting a seven-year agricultural transition period from direct payments to a new system, the Government wish to ensure a gradual move so that farmers can adapt. Over the past few months, the role of farmers and food producers in feeding the nation has quite rightly been on everyone’s minds. Working as I do at Defra, I particularly want to record my gratitude to all who have worked so hard, from farm to fork, to ensure we have access to the food we need. The importance that the Government place on food security is recognised in the Bill, with a duty placed on the Secretary of State to lay a report on food security before Parliament at least—I emphasise at least—every five years. We would certainly not intend to wait five years before publishing the first report, which will of course take into account what has been learned from the current pandemic The Secretary of State will have the powers to act in truly exceptional market conditions, such as those we are enduring at present, or in extreme weather conditions if these result in a severe disturbance in agricultural markets. As we move from area-based payments towards payments for the delivery of public benefit, we must also make sure that our farmers are fairly rewarded by a fair marketplace for the food that they produce Part 3 of the Bill contains provisions to strengthen the position of farmers in the food supply chain. Fair dealing provisions will introduce statutory codes of practice to regulate those buying from farmers; we will look at the dairy and red meat sectors first. Farmers’ position in the supply chain can also be strengthened by allowing groups of farmers to form producer organisations, which can access derogations from competition law, giving them the power to co-ordinate activities and become more competitive. The Bill contains powers to collect and share data, allowing the Government to strengthen existing market reporting services, and to provide information which will help farmers to make clearly evidenced business decisions and manage risk. The Bill will enable the streamlining and modernising of the regulation of fertilisers. It also sets up the new multispecies livestock information service in England, which will provide the best livestock traceability. As a Minister with biosecurity in my brief, I think it essential that we enhance traceability The Bill also attends to a fairer distribution of the red meat levy, which I know has been an issue in Wales and Scotland. It will make pragmatic modifications to tenancy legislation, introducing more contemporary arrangements that will work for both tenants and landlords. It also contains powers to amend existing marketing standards, and to make new organics regulations and amend the existing regime so that these can be modernised to work better for domestic producers Part 6 provides powers to ensure the UK’s compliance with its obligations under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture. Regulations made under this part will allow the apportionment, between the nations of the United Kingdom, of agreed limits on certain types of financial support. I should note that this clause refers only to the Agreement on Agriculture and not to other WTO treaties, such as GATT, which the United Kingdom is bound to as a WTO member Clauses 43 to 45 and Schedules 5 and 6 have been included in the Bill at the request of the Welsh Government and DAERA Ministers. I am pleased to present them on their behalf. The Scottish Government have chosen to introduce their own agriculture Bill The Government have made it clear in the joint letter from the Environment Secretary and the International Trade Secretary published on 5 June, which I asked to be circulated to noble Lords yesterday, that they are alive to the issue of trade standards. My honourable Friend the Minister for Farming in the other place has stated: “In all of our trade negotiations, we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards. ” I can confirm that all food—I emphasise all food—coming into the country will continue to have to meet existing import requirements as the withdrawal Act transfers EU standards on to the UK statute book. This specifically means that the import of chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-fed beef, for example, is prohibited I realise that this is a brisk run-through of some elements of the Bill but I want to keep my remarks fairly short, so that we have plenty of time for other contributions. The Agriculture Bill is the beginning of a journey that we acknowledge will take time. We will put farmers and land managers at the heart of that journey. It needs to be their project too; it will not work if it is not. We will support them through the agricultural transition by adequately rewarding them for protecting and enhancing the environment, while enabling their businesses to prosper in the production of outstanding British food and drink for domestic and international consumption In this context, given the immense challenges that this planet faces—an increasing world population; climate change and its impact; the imperatives of enhancing the environment; and sufficient food production—how should we best use scientific advances to aid us? We have to wrestle with all these challenges. Innovation has been part of agricultural history, as have the traditions of good husbandry and custodianship. We clearly seek a blend of succeeding generations of farmers and new entrants. Coming from farming stock, I say that we ask much of the British farmer—as usual, at the very beginning, in contending with the weather. As some of your Lordships will know from an earlier consideration on derogation, this year had an exceptionally wet winter and spring followed by an exceptionally dry May I look forward to this debate because, by coming from all parts of the country, noble Lords will be well aware of the dynamics of their local farming sectors. I beg to move.', 'Madam President. It is a keen discussion of this important matter and is well available, not only to handle and communicate, as it is quite clear that they are diverse. This is one of the things that have been made clear. Many things have been written, and we have discussed these livestock contracts that we have been considering today and have realized that they seem to be on their own. Criticism in making these contracts, of course, is due to poor consultation. I think it\'s the highest. the leading agricultural minister Sigurður Ingi Jóhannsson made a more important mistake when he did not have any more members in this process, including a council member, since it was clear and has long realized that this would be a divided opinion, both in the community and particularly at the council. So no wonder, these are the large sums of money from our common funds. It would have been strange if such sums and agreements had not caused some controversy when it came to a discussion about him both in the community and when the Allied Council is putting him down, as we have seen today, and it became evident immediately to 1st. The point. Of course, it has to be critical of how late the start was. During the final days of the council, we are doing as much as we can in practice when the time of the present agreement was long ago seen. There is nothing but a path that has not been started before about going through these contracts. What is the livestock contract, and what is it for? The aim should be to promote Icelandic agriculture and improve agricultural quality, especially when we look at food safety, improve the supply of farmers, and, in fact, the competitiveness of the whole agricultural sector. We want to promote innovation and investment both in the early product and in its entire agriculture and processing. I think we\'d like to promote the environment of the wand companies and contribute to the value of food at home in the district. Above all, to ensure food security and to place high environmental importance on the environment, i.e. The carbon tracks. And perhaps most important, it is the obligation to forbid the introduction of animal products produced under less circumstances and to reduce the requirements of equipment than we do here in the domestic product. That\'s one of the things I\'ve felt were missing a bit during the discussion. However, the matter has made some changes to a professional committee. Most of them are improvements. The members of the left green have done their part there. The unscrupulous accounting regulations now in 2019 are of great importance, as well as to postpone the subsiding of the milk industry\'s evasion committee and to adopt some form of income market, which was not well prepared and is, of course, controversial. It is lacking in our left green opinion that the agricultural treaties serve the aims of sustainable agriculture and domestic food production in the interests of our community, where we base on environmental, animal protection, welfare, and loyalty views. A wide range of the origination and the transmission of information to consumers should be considered, and should be considered as important, including to achieve the social peace we need so much in this big matter and that there is trust between the manufacturer and consumers. There, effective and reliable information is important. The agreements have been criticized by many, and the council received many reviews. It seems as if the most criticism has been on the length of time, i.e. These ten years, the contracts being established far into the future. As was the case with the people before me, that\'s a big difference in opinion. Criticism has been just as much about the amount of money to go into agriculture and this contract and criticism of the plan to put down the production management of milk production, especially from farmers themselves. They were to build for the future on a highly creative system, but they developed a revised law. The sheep contract was considered to be a fine object, especially to the major sheepfolds, where people have almost completely secularized. The concern was that production could include Moving to an area where bait land would not be particularly good, and especially that an increasing force for production could create overproduction of lamb. But sheep farmers did not come out as well from these contracts as from cow farmers. They did not get the same kind of right to choose for the rest. However, there is now a change, therefore, in view of the recommendations made on the job committee, and we are all being revised in 2019 C.E. This is important, especially for sheep and gardeners. They get that right, i.e. to choose for yourself from now on. As we discuss the agricultural system and its policy, we need to discuss the entire chain of value and consider the cost and cost. Our review by a representative of the work board is presented, with the permission of a president: The most efficient movement ▪ green tenders highlight sustainable agriculture policy and consider it important to support government contributions in such goals. Self - destructive thinking, in fact, hides. In the absence of renewable resource use, it is lost or disappeared. The usefulness of renewable resources is therefore important to set baits to avoid harming the Member States so that the resource of this resource goes right into the courtyard. The agricultural agreements on the use and protection of vegetation would need to be more clear, and it is important to plan for land healing and to map crops in terms of its use capacity to succeed and become new in government agricultural policy. Where there is a need to ensure that the use of natural resources will be sustainable, whether products are consumed within the country or in the foreign market. This, of course, is very clear. You may feel that you are not far enough at the contract under which you live. We have stressed that there will be a clear agrienvironmental policy, and public agricultural contributions will be conditioned to follow up the objectives of this area so that we will achieve them. We consider agriculture to be very important in the context of environmental and climate issues. The use of renewable and environmental energy has only been developed here, which, of course, is of great importance. We need to promote such use, and in this arrangement more is needed. Although some progress has been made in the content of the work programme, this need to be clearer to the market agreements. It\'s into bioproducts. Its support is only to be increased and adaptability is to be provided, but as is often stated, it can be better if sufficient. We need to do this as well as others to shape manufacturing policies. If we are going to aim for the production of organic farm plants to match the demand, we as consumers need to be aware that such production will always cost much more than the standard. Sadly, the situation is that people who are involved in such sceptres, i.e. is experimenting in organic production, whatever it is, running into walls after a certain period of time and not receiving adequate support. We have an example from my district where people are engaged in unconventional agricultural equipment, in Charles\'Bases in Bergerald, Havari with food production. There, the system has been fortified, e.g. Do not come together as if it had to be done to make such a wand grow fairly fast. That\'s one of the things that would have had to be handled better here. Even though these things are being added, I worry that people are being pushed into something that support is not going to cover when they need them. I think we need some kind of immune funding. We also need to make plans to see how the land can depend on domestic food production much more than is currently available. It is important that the domestic food production and agricultural production of an alien demand for these products. We need to ensure the national food and food security. In this regard, we can look in many directions - whether for crops or just traditional breeding or gardening. So interesting and a need to examine the pros and cons of environmental expenditures, e.g. exported agricultural products. Because the following talk may not sound too good to many, but I thought it would be a reason to consider it so that as consumers, we might understand the supplies involved in bringing in different products and wonder if we were really willing to pay the price that matches it. There is, of course, little more important than increasing consumer environmental awareness as we strengthen the position of domestic agricultural products. The source label is important in the marketing of Icelandic agrienvironmental products, whether here at home or abroad. But it is also part of a more powerful consumer protection. We need to ensure proper meanings of products and resources whether they are imported or not, e.g. in view of the use of genetically modified organisms in the production process. Today is not, of course, a follow-up. I think 25. improve the well-being of animals, e.g. Never was used, but it is about the limitations of imports from other countries. We have heard examples of buying products around the world, and they are even repacked in the North countries or something, and they are sold as such to this land and many parts of the world. I\'m asking myself, "" How can I be sure the products we bring in are not coming from countries where, for example? \' Child labor takes place. We\'ve been discussing some of the Asian chicken jokes. Other factors have been mentioned in this regard. We know how to do so in many areas in poorer lands, these larger countries, and children as well as adults work in an unhealthy environment. There\'s one thing that I think we\'ve done really well, that\'s the antibiotic gift. We severely limited the use of antibiotics in feed. I think it was an important decision that has set us among the top nations in food production because the use of such drugs is absolutely minimal in this country. It affects our human health. Not long ago we read in the news that large amounts of antibiotics were found in Danish children. I think that at the same time we have to face the fact that we\'re making these high demands, there are many ways in which Icelandic agriculture is less effective than the person we compete with. But I believe that\'s what they\'re doing. I think it\'s very important to have our product as clean as possible. In this regard it was interesting that I was told, although we may not produce much apples, but I had no idea that about 90% of apples are coming from China.', 'Good afternoon, Madam President. Ladies and gentlemen, I come today to note the strategic lines that the board I have the honour to address will address in 2016, according to the action of the Government and the administrative work line of the Rural Council for the forest, agricultural, livestock and agri-food sectors. I have to say, in addition, that the change that has taken place to give the importance that rural environment has in Galicia with the creation of this council is due to global recovery and wakes up with the intention of giving strategic impetus to the sectors most hit by the crisis. Thus, the designation of the Directorate-General for Agriculture and Agri-Food is not capricious; livestock is the main generating sector of activity in the Greek countryside and its problem is complex. Since my arrival, I have focused my efforts on reaching out to Galician gainers with more acceptable conditions. For this reason, and without taking another two months in this responsibility, I had the opportunity to make different meetings with the sheep on foot, with the representations, with the tractor also, and even with the minister of agriculture, to demand consistency in the follow-up to the dairy agreement promoted by the ministry, which came into force last October, so that it has a positive impact on prices. Honestly, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that this agreement will offer a future and for the first time the possibility of giving stability, sustainability and transparency to such a strategic sector, I would say of the most strategic for Galicia. For now it has already been achieved to brake something very important, which was to continue to lower prices, to curb the fall of those prices and to increase them very slightly. So I\'m going to come by and tell you the main lines of work this board is going to address in the next few months. On the one hand, the 2014-2020 Rural Development Plan, which, as I had before my colleagues in the Commission 3rd and in the appearance of budgets, was approved last 18 by the European Commission, and which will entail for our rurals a public investment of no less than 1,180 million euros for the period between now and 2020. Our efforts will focus mainly on three ways of action: The improvement in the quality of life of the rural population, promoting the provision of basic services that help to set the rural population, create employment and reduce the risk of poverty. Secondly, the promotion of the competitiveness of Greek agriculture by modernising agricultural and forestry holdings; the incorporation of young farmers into market-oriented farms with a capacity for economic diversification; and the management of the territory and improved productivity of the agri-food and forestry industry, promoting the production of high added value that we now lack. The conservation and re-evaluation of Galicia\'s natural and cultural heritage in rural areas, the promotion of sustainable management of natural resources and the fight against climate change. The measures are intended to empower the primary sector as a fundamental part of the Greek rural environment, ensuring that agricultural holdings develop productive models compatible with the environmental and territorial functions inherent in agricultural activity. I believe that by taking part in the development of a balanced and sustainable territory, we are going to promote the achievement of a sustainable rural area. In the course of well-being, we will also act to increase employment and improve the quality of life of farmers and workers in the agricultural sector, and to support their incomes as a basis for preserving the family character of Greek rural life. For this reason, it is essential to provide the population with access to safe, healthy, diversified food of good quality, thus contributing to the protection of public health and also in this way of farmers and workers in the agricultural sector. And not only for people, animal welfare and health is an undeniable goal in our agricultural policy. The same is true of the strengthening of the food industry in Galicia. We\'re going to approach it by working to increase the added value of our products, facilitating their export capacity. To that end, we must contribute to the collective organisation of farmers, encouraging the territorial relationship of production, processing and marketing of agricultural products, particularly through the promotion of short chains of marketing and support for research and innovation and the development of new agri-food products. Ladies and gentlemen, the Government of Greece considers the fight against rural depopulation to be irrevocable, so we mark ourselves as targets, on the one hand, to contribute to the renewal of farm owners and consolidate their agricultural activity; on the other hand, to promote the transfer of farms between family members and outside families and, like not?, to encourage the diversity of sustainable production systems in different agricultural areas to generate employment and also added value. Given the cross-sectional nature of the fight against depopulation, another objective is to design and promote among the competent advisors training in practice in the centres of work of the Greek agricultural and industrial agri-food farms and outside the autonomous community of students undergoing regular training studies, as well as to encourage their recruitment in different farms and industries. In the same way, we will favour the incorporation into agricultural holdings and their transmissions by natural or legal persons who justify their ability to carry out a viable project on an individual basis or integrate it into an associative exploitation. Through aid for the modernisation of agricultural holdings financed by the EAFRD funds, worth more than EUR 48 million, we will increase the funds devoted to improving agricultural holdings and also aid for the incorporation of young people. We added two new lines of action: aid to the first installation of small farms and service and counselling, as well as management and replacement, and we kept payments, the early cessation of agricultural activity and the aid for the recruitment of comprehensive agricultural insurance. All with the fundamental objectives of, on the one hand, numerically and geographically dispersal aid, focusing on the rural areas of the interiors of the provinces of Lugo and Ourense, improving the socio-economic weight of the agricultural sector and raising the percentage of women who access the ownership or quota of agricultural holdings, reaching and even hoping to exceed 50%. Diversifying the agricultural sector, given the productive potential of the Italian countryside, by incorporating aid into small farms. We will encourage the restructuring process to achieve a greater dimension of agricultural and livestock holdings, which is a more than fundamental issue. We will provide full protection for farmers and farmers, by hiring agricultural insurance lines, subsidized, adapted to the productive needs of agricultural activities and farmers in our rural areas, a real tool for dealing with natural disasters or other types of incency. We will promote the use of alternative energies for the moderation of costs on farms. Agricultural production represents the main asset of rural economic activity, measured both in terms of gross domestic product and in terms of employment. In this sense, it is a key element in the fixing of rural populations. This requires the application of sustainable approaches, geared to the production of quality foods, which meet the demand of a demanding and competitive plural market. Ladies and gentlemen, as I said, the achievement of a sustainable rural environment must necessarily start from the development of a balanced and sustainable territory. To that end we will focus our efforts to avoid the abandonment of the Greek agricultural model; also to promote both agricultural and complementary activity within the framework of sustainable economic and social development in the rural world, avoiding deforestation; to improve agricultural structures, in order to obtain decent incomes for farmers; to defend silvopastoristic systems of mountain use; to promote reuse and recovery and improvement of homes as well as facilities linked to agricultural holdings, and, like not, to maintain natural heritage and the protection of landscape. That\'s why training is so important. In Galicia we have six training and agroforestry experimentation centres, which will develop a comprehensive offer directed especially to youth and active population, integrating the different vocational training subsystems, professional initiation and continuing training of professionals in the sector. Actions are being designed to bring a more comprehensive and diversified training offer to all the Galician regions, especially the most disadvantaged areas. The permanent contact between this training system and the productive sector ensures an offer tailored to the needs and priorities of the different regions and production systems. In these six centres dependent on the Council, there is a lack of training cycles of medium and higher vocational training of agricultural specialities. Given the practical nature of this training, it is essential to provide the necessary equipment and media centres, taking into account the needs of infrastructure renewal to provide quality education in line with company demands. To achieve these objectives, the budget for forestry training will be increased by 103%, with the aim – as I said – of improving professional skills, with a particular focus on youth and rural women. In addition, we will open new lines of help for exchange actions, technology transfer and training activities. I am particularly interested in the exchange of good practices between farmers and farmers from different European countries and regions. We will also develop measures to bring training closer to the most disadvantaged high mountain areas with a mobile unit that will facilitate the improvement of professional skills. We know it\'s not an easy task and we must add effort by all those involved; by our administration, ladies and gentlemen, by you as people who will undoubtedly contribute to improving this sector, as well as by the inhabitants of the territory and society as a whole. It is very important that we realize that the sustainable development of rural areas is essential for the protection of land, with its own economic, environmental and social idiosyncrasy. For this, from the part that we belong to, we will try to take advantage of the potential of the local characteristics of agricultural space, to achieve the improvement of the demographic balance between urban and rural. In addition, we place ourselves as a duty the development of agricultural, livestock and forestry productions, ordering their coexistence with non-agricultural activities and integrating social and environmental functions, including here the fight against the greenhouse effect through the placing in value of biomass, the storage of sustainable vegetable carbon and the control of gas emissions. As for the well-being itself, directed both to the health of people and animals, and even plants, these days I had the honour to inaugurate the Fourth Animal Food Congress. From this congress we draw many conclusions, and also ideas for the future, but above all the certainty that both our food and that of our animals are perfectly secured, thanks to the comprehensive controls that are being carried out in the elaboration of thoughts. Although we always defend and defend the consumption of pasture and forage, it is also true that feeding through thought is essential in animal nutrition, by vitamins and nutrients, as well as many others. Galicia is Spain\'s first producer of controlled and quality food for cattle. In addition, it is the fourth autonomous community producing general thinking in the country. Intensive and regular systems of thought throughout the production chain provide both safety for animals and for the final consumer, and high quality food is produced in Galicia and, above all, safe from the point of view of controls. Animals produce better quality of milk and share better quality meat, complementing the fiber that provides the fodder of our farms with the properties of thought, which cannot be lacking in food to achieve a balance. Therefore, the guarantee for animals and people through comprehensive controls and nutritional balance are the keys to the excellence of animal nutrition. It\'s no coincidence, then, that they are like ""Terreira galega"" or ""Pig Celta"" among the first brands recognized by distribution and consumers as a guarantee of quality, and even better, security. We will continue to work in that direction, but also in the protection of plants, in the double prevention aspect to prevent the arrival and spread of pests and the management and integrated fight of pests to avoid the development of harmful organisms of plants and similar ones. Consumers, and more and more, demand quality food production, which is environmentally friendly and animal welfare and which is subject to a system of control and traceability. In this sense, the European Union is moving this demand into Community legislation in all its aspects: production, health, economic, environmental and social, so that food safety requirements become a reference for compliance. On the other hand, animal health does not consist solely of guaranteeing food security; it is a basic element both in the defence of public health and in the profitability of gainful production. In order to obtain safe food, we must ensure a proper level of protection of animal health and food chain. I am referring both to the identification of farms and animals, such as disease control and eradication programs, such as the hygiene of primary production, the quality of raw milk or waste treatment. Even so, vegetable health is also a fundamental axis of agricultural health policy. We will strengthen the lines aimed at maintaining and preserving the health and vitality of forest ecosystems, with special attention to the phytosanitary state of the Greek mountains and on a new line of work, which will be directed to the conservation of genetic, forest resources and the improvement of forest reproductive matter, to enhance the development of different varieties of forest species, ensuring that our mountains contribute to all environmental and social objectives. With regard to forest management and production, whose name is not random either, we will do special fincapé in forest development societies as an instrument to make the management of mountains sustainable and thus overcome the enormous fragmentation and the multitude of owners that hinders viable management and profitable exploitation. And I don\'t want to forget to mention to you that we are in a process of reviewing the Galician Forest Plan, within a working group made up of members of the Forest Council, who is already finishing their meetings, from which they will derive the post of guidelines that will serve as the basis for the review and thus count on a model of mountain updated and accepted by the Greek society, and which is supposed to point out our forest wealth. In the field of forest, we will also try to respond to demand for research and transfer, which will mean the continuous increase in the quantity and quality of forest products such as raw materials from Galicia\'s first and second transformation industry, to contribute to the improvement of its competitive position. In addition, we will intensify fire prevention techniques through the development of forestry treatments, which will reduce the vulnerability of forest masses, fires of cup and high intensity, fuel control techniques in slaughterhouses and techniques of extinction, control and safety in the fight against fires. I repeat the quality and I would like to stress the substantial improvement in the promotion of the marketing of our products, with more assistance to the operating costs of regulatory councils, especially for the smaller ones, and also for the promotion and marketing of our agricultural products, which come from small producers to industry and regulatory councils. In addition, quality controls will be strengthened, which is very important for the work of regulatory councils, since the control programs that apply are very expensive and even more so with the current obligation to believe in Enac, which requires more and more rigorous continuous controls. As you know, ladies and gentlemen, despite the prestige that Greek agri-food products have in the markets and also among consumers, the agricultural sector has important deficiencies and structural difficulties that make access to these markets difficult. The small business dimension and the lack of integration are the factors that limit their access to national and international markets in a competitive way, so it is essential to develop actions to promote the marketing of Greek agri-food products. And despite everything, we\'re talking -- even though we\'re saying it\'s a girl -- about an industry that makes 4,721 million euros a year and employs about 20,000 people in Galicia, which means 16.4% of the total billing and 15% of the total employment of the Galician industry. We will give more impetus to the Special Agri-Food Promotion Plan to carry out the promotional actions directly carried out by the Rural Media Council, advertising campaigns, fair attendance, organization of various events such as wine tastings, watermarks or complaints, and also those carried out directly by both regulatory councils and sectoral associations. These actions will mainly be based on the defence of the prestige of Galician agri-food production, the promotion and increase of the share of these products in the whole of the Greek food production. As a measure of support for modernization, internationalisation and improvement of competitiveness, innovation and productivity, we will focus on investment promotion strategy, which has a benefit for the Greek producers, as well as those with regard to incorporation and innovation to technological improvements, giving priority to areas in the process of depopulation or disadvantaged, with the aim of creating jobs and empowering sectors of industry and services. Also in aid to the Greek companies, in order to improve the marketing of their agricultural and agri-food products, we will increase aid for investments aimed at obtaining eco-products or aid also increased to investments made by associative base companies, so that the added value that comes up to the agri-food processing itself returns to the producers. Ladies and gentlemen, we found ourselves, in addition, in a crucial year for the launch of the new Leader 2014-2020, of which we hope to achieve even better results, which we will soon get to know and which are about to finish. The implementation of the program will once again bet on participation, through which the rural population will be the protagonist and define its own line and its local development strategies. The projects developed in the future of Plan Leader are today a source of vital importance for consolidation and job creation in rural areas. Only during 2015 will the program enable the consolidation of more than 1,500 jobs and the creation of more than 200 new jobs. Making rural population and improving its quality of life is an unattainable goal without improving rural infrastructure. The rush to irrigation and progress in the partial restructuring processes are one of the axes that this board will work on directly. We will help the Greek municipalities to make improvements in their basic infrastructures in rural areas, specifically within the Rural Road Framework Plan, which will benefit...']","<|system|>

COP21 has delivered an historic new global climate change agreement that takes a significant step forward towards reducing, on a global scale, the emissions that cause climate change. For the first time, nearly 200 countries have made a commitment to act together and to be held accountable. In doing so, this agreement will help to protect not just our environment but our national and economic security, now and for generations to come. As the Prime Minister said in his speech at the start of conference: “instead of making excuses tomorrow to our children and grandchildren, we should be taking action against climate change today. ” I am proud to say that there are no more excuses. With the Paris agreement, we have shown that the world has committed to action This deal is unequivocally in Britain’s national interest. It moves us towards a level playing field at a global level within which the UK’s society and businesses can thrive, as we transition to a low-carbon economy. This is a deal we are wholeheartedly committed to, recognising that action by one state alone cannot and will not solve climate change. It is what we do together that counts This is a moment that all parties in the House can take significant credit for. Together, we passed the Climate Change Act 2008, which set an example to the world of what ambitious domestic climate action looks like. Together, since Copenhagen in 2009, we have supported a long, difficult and complex negotiation, which has brought us to this point. I want to pay tribute not just to the Prime Minister and my colleagues across Government, but to my predecessors as Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change for all the hard work they put in to bring us to this point As a country, we should be proud of the role we have played, leading in the European Union, working closely with major global players, including the US and China, and leading many of the negotiations. My Department, with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development, has worked tirelessly to build the political conditions and the capacity to enable countries to act. The UK team in Paris last week showed commitment, passion and resilience. When Laurent Fabius asked me to chair the finance session at 4 am on Friday morning, I was well supported, and when I left at 6.30 am, they stayed to write up the conclusions and send them to the presidency. That, Mr Speaker, was commitment The UK played a key role in building alliances and shared positions, especially with the most vulnerable countries, to ensure that pressure for ambition could be maximised. The deal in Paris was not done to us; it was done by us. Indeed, it reflects many of the elements that we as a country have already committed to as part of the Climate Change Act. Of course Paris is not the end of the road. We cannot sit back and say, “Job done. ” Far from it: Paris is the beginning. Now the hard work to implement the agreement begins. Let me turn to what the nearly 200 countries have agreed. First, we have set out a clear long-term goal for the world to achieve net zero emissions by the end of the century. The long-term goal sends a strong signal to investors, businesses and policy makers that the shift to a global low-carbon economy will happen and it provides the confidence needed to drive the scale of investment required. We have confirmed our collective ambition to limit global temperature rises to below 2° C. We have agreed a further aspiration of 1.5°. However, the current level of commitments by individual countries will not meet this ambition, so crucially, countries will come back to the table to assess overall progress towards the 2° goal in 2018 and every five years thereafter As investment grows and the costs of low-carbon technologies come down, the Paris process will provide not just the opportunity but the political pressure to step up individual countries’ emissions reductions targets. Starting in 2020, countries are expected to update their own plans to cut emissions, and will be legally obliged to do so again every five years, thus providing regular political moments to scale up ambition This agreement is not only comprehensive in its scope, as it also recognises the role of both developed economies and emerging economies in helping the poorest and most vulnerable countries to protect themselves from the effects of climate change as they transition to a low-carbon economy Over the last five years, the UK’s £3.87 billion international climate fund has been helping millions of the world’s poor better to withstand extreme weather and rising temperatures. At the UN Secretary-General summit in September, the Prime Minister announced a significant uplift to increase climate finance by at least 50% with £5.8 billion-worth of climate finance over the next five years to support poor and vulnerable countries to adapt to climate change and to curb emissions. This is part of a global commitment to mobilise $100 billion a year from both the public and private sector to protect the most vulnerable and support economic growth from 2020. Other developed countries, including Germany, France, the US, Japan, and Canada have all recently announced increases in their climate finance Important as the Paris agreement is, we will achieve our ultimate ambition only if it acts as a catalyst for transformational action from all parts of society. That is why it has been so important to see real action over the last month from business and civil society. A new initiative, for example, called “Mission Innovation”, will see some of the biggest global economies—including the UK, US, and India—doubling their investments in clean energy research and development. Crucially, it is private investors who will join us in this endeavour to bring down the costs of low-carbon technologies Here in the UK, we have committed to doubling spending in clean energy research and development, so that by 2020 we will be spending in excess of £400 million. That pledge has been matched by 19 other countries worldwide. This is in recognition of the fact that we will tackle climate change effectively only if we find technologies that are both clean and cheap. Let me emphasise that the announcement I made last month—that I would set out proposals to close coal by 2025 and restrict its use from 2023—added to the momentum at Paris. The Paris agreement truly marks an historic turning-point. It builds on the Kyoto protocol, and for the first time ever provides the comprehensive framework in which not just developed countries, but nearly every country of the world has committed to take the global action needed to solve a global problem. Of course, it was hard fought and of course it required compromise to bring everyone with us. Of course, too, it has not solved every problem in one go Now we have to set about implementing the commitments made, but we should not underestimate the significance of what has been achieved. All parties have recognised that economic and global security requires us to tackle climate change. All have come together to commit to a single goal—net zero carbon emissions by the end of the century. All have agreed to set out plans to curb emissions and to be held accountable for their actions. We have made a huge step forward in meeting our responsibilities to this and future generations. As the excellent Executive Secretary to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Christiana Figueres, said: “I used to say we can, we must, we will. Now I can say we did. ”', 'My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Parminter for initiating this important debate, and for her excellent and informative speech. This has been a fascinating debate from which I have learned a great deal, not least from my noble friend Lady Suttie in her powerful speech on the domestic and international impact of plastic waste, and also from the noble Baroness, Lady Jenkin, on the importance of conserving resources—something my mother certainly instilled in me from a very early age, although I confess that I bought a new suit for my wedding The noble Lord, Lord Marland, remembers the coalition Government fondly. I am sure that he was hugely committed to tackling climate change as a Minister in it, but my recollection, as the then Deputy Prime Minister’s chief of staff, is of a constant and debilitating battle with the staggering myopia of George Osborne as he tried to undermine almost every significant effort to tackle climate change, squandering the economic opportunities we could have seized and wasting time that we could not afford to waste Having said that, I welcome the Government’s commitment to a net-zero economy by 2050, but I hope that the Minister recognises that this ambition will be meaningless unless it is backed up by concrete plans to reshape our economy in a way that promotes resource efficiency and can deliver net-zero carbon usage. There is no point willing ambitious ends unless we are prepared to will equally ambitious means To do that, we must shift our thinking so that, instead of being overwhelmed by the challenges of reaching a net-zero economy, we are able to inspire people by its opportunities. The noble Lord, Lord Browne of Ladyton, made the important point that we have to be honest with people that the changes required will mean us having to change the way we live our lives. Part of our job is to make sure that that is a positive prospect rather than purely seen in negative terms. As the special report of the LSE Growth Commission, Delivering Strong and Sustainable Growth in the UK, notes: “The pathway to net-zero must be perceived across the UK as a whole-economy opportunity to deliver material benefits to communities, as opposed to creating costs and inconveniences for households … Done right, in 2030 the UK could have higher living standards and improved health and wellbeing, with UK businesses innovating and adopting cutting-edge zero-carbon technologies and practices fit for the mid-21st century. ” That is the prize on offer, but we will seize it only if the Government have the courage to lead by example, not just in setting world-leading ambitions, welcome though they are, but much more critically in showing that they are willing to take the complex and urgent decisions needed to realise them. Britain has a particular obligation to show this leadership as host of the 26th UN Climate Change Conference taking place later this year. That is why, as the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, highlighted, yesterday’s Budget was deeply dispiriting. The noble Baroness also made the critical point about the importance of a just transition to a green economy—something noticeably absent from the Budget While there were some welcome measures, they were offset by a complete absence of action in critical areas such as home energy and other building efficiencies and highly counterproductive actions in areas such as the £27 billion road-building programme and the ongoing fuel duty freeze while public transport fares continue to soar. I hope in his summing up that the Minister will be able to explain why the Government missed the opportunity in the Budget to take action on energy efficiency. It is such a critical area, contributing a significant proportion of carbon emissions, and it must be tackled. As he knows, the Domestic Premises (Energy Performance) Bill, introduced by my noble friend Lord Foster of Bath with cross-party support, is a modest but important measure in this regard. I hope that he will tell us that he will press the Government to support it At the moment, the chasm between the measures required to meet the Government’s 2050 net-zero target and the measures set out in the Budget is jaw-dropping. It is as if someone told Rishi Sunak, “Don’t worry about the net-zero target. We don’t really mean it. ” That is not just a disaster for the climate but a massive missed opportunity for our economy. It has the twin impact of introducing uncertainty while failing to inspire innovation or investment. We should be taking advantage of the 2050 target to support and galvanise business with a vision of Britain as a world-leading green economy able to boost our competitiveness internationally and deliver comparative advantage to our economy. We need to set out a comprehensive road map to that new economy so that businesses and entrepreneurs have sufficient confidence in the direction of travel to assume the leading role they will need to play in this transition So much needs to be done and we cannot afford to wait. We should be investing now in the modern energy and transport infrastructure that we will need to underpin this new green economy. We should be reshaping regulation of the financial system now so that it is incentivised to support cutting-edge green industries, is transparent over the climate risks of its investments and is required to hold appropriate capital reserves against loans to fossil fuel industries that may well become non-performing. My noble friend Lady Sheehan and the noble Lord, Lord Gadhia, also raised the important issue of the dangers to the financial system of stranded assets The Paris conference committed the world to limiting the rise in global average temperatures to well below 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the increases to 1.5 degrees centigrade, yet it is estimated by the research and campaigning organisation Positive Money that the financial system is currently financing warming of more than 4 degrees centigrade. Its executive director, Fran Boait, said that that “represents an existential threat not only to finance and the economy, but to life on earth”, so we have to take action today, not at some distant point in the future, to ensure that we have a regulatory system that can bring these financial institutions into line with our net-zero objective. I hope that the Minister will be able to indicate how the Government plan to start going about doing that. We must not allow a situation to occur where the taxpayer ends up having to bail out financial institutions once again for reckless investments that end up damaging the global environment and the integrity of the financial system A number of authoritative bodies, such as the climate change committee, have set out the sort of measures that will be required to transform our economy if we are to meet our 2050 objective, but very little of it is happening, and every effort to propose practical steps is rebuffed with the assurance that a new strategy or review will be published shortly. The Chancellor was at it yesterday, shunting off urgently needed decisions until the net-zero Treasury review that we were promised ahead of COP 26. We do not need more distant strategies or reviews. We need action plans. We need progress reports. We need accountability. What we chose to do or not to do now will determine what our children and grandchildren are able to do in the future The coronavirus has taught us the severe dangers of getting into a feedback loop where delay is all we are left with. We are, we hope, still in the containment stage of catastrophic climate change, but if we do not act soon, if we do not give global leadership now, if we do not move on from the talk and start rising to meet the challenges and to exploit the opportunities, we will miss the containment window and all we will have left are delay and mitigation. That would be a gross betrayal of the obligations to the generations who follow us. Despite the disappointments of the Budget, I have to have faith that the Government will shift their approach and match their actions to their ambitions. I have to have faith because we cannot wait five years. We do not have the time to waste on despair. If faith can move mountains, then surely it can move the noble Lord, Lord Callanan, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues. Perhaps it can even move Dominic Cummings, but perhaps that is asking too much I shall finish on a positive note. I welcome the fact that the 2050 target has established Britain as a global leader, at least in its ambitions. I believe that the Government can also make us a global leader in our actions, but if they are to do so, they will have to show that they have the moral courage to lead, the vision to inspire and, most importantly, the determination and commitment to deliver concrete action. Global Britain leading the world in tackling humanity’s gravest threat is a global Britain I would sign up to. I hope that the Government will rise to the challenge.', 'With permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a statement on the net zero strategy and the heat and buildings strategy—but first, if I may, I will congratulate my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary and his wife Harriet on the birth of their daughter on Friday. I can report to the House that both mother and baby are healthy and doing well, as is the Secretary of State. I am sure that the whole House will join me in offering our congratulations. [Hon. Members: “Hear, hear. ”] The statement is all about future generations as well, because we know that we must act now on climate change. The activities of our economies, communities and societies are changing our environment. If we do not take action now, we will continue to see the worst effects of climate change We have already travelled a significant way down the path to net zero. Between 1990 and 2019, we grew our economy by 78% and cut our emissions by 44%, decarbonising faster than any other G7 country. Since 2010, the UK has quadrupled its renewable electricity generation and reduced carbon emissions in the power generation sector by some 70%. In the past year alone, we have published the Prime Minister’s 10-point plan for a green industrial revolution, the energy White Paper, the North sea transition deal, the industrial decarbonisation strategy, the transport decarbonisation plan, the hydrogen strategy and more. Earlier this month, we unveiled a landmark commitment to decarbonise the UK’s electricity system by 2035 But there is still a substantial length of road to travel. We must continue to take decisive action if we are to meet our net zero goal, so today I am pleased to announce two major Government initiatives: the net zero strategy and the heat and buildings strategy. This is not just an environmental transition; it also represents an important economic change, echoing even the explosion in industry and exports in the first industrial revolution more than 250 years ago We will fully embrace this new, green industrial revolution, helping the UK to level up as we build back better and get to the front of the global race to go green. We need to capitalise on it to ensure that British industries and workers benefit. I can therefore announce that the strategy will support up to 440,000 jobs across sectors and across all parts of the UK in 2030. There will be more specialists in low-carbon fuels in Northern Ireland and low-carbon hydrogen in Sheffield, electric vehicle battery production in the north-east of England, engineers in Wales, green finance in London and offshore wind technicians in Scotland The strategy will harness the power of the private sector, giving businesses and industry the certainty they need to invest and grow in the UK and make the UK home to new, ambitious projects. The policies and spending brought forward in the strategy, along with regulations, will leverage up to £90 billion of private investment by 2030, levelling up our former industrial heartlands The strategy also clearly highlights the steps that the Government are taking to work with industry to bring down the costs of key technologies, from electric vehicles to heat pumps—just as we did with offshore wind, in which we are now the world leader. Those steps will give the UK a competitive edge and get us to the head of the race We have spoken often in this place of late about the importance of protecting consumers, and consumers are indeed at the heart of the strategy. Making green changes such as boosting the energy efficiency of our homes will help to cut the cost of bills for consumers across the UK. Switching to cleaner sources of energy will reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and, again, bring down costs down the line This plan is also our best route to overcoming current challenges. The current price spikes in gas show the need to reduce our reliance on volatile imported fossil fuels rapidly. Although there is a role for gas as a transition fuel, moving away from imports quickly is in the best interests of bill payers. With our ambitious set of policies, the strategy sets out how we meet carbon budgets 4 and 5 and our nationally determined contribution. It puts us on the path for carbon budget 6 and ultimately on course for net zero by 2050 We are now setting up the industrial decarbonisation and hydrogen revenue support scheme to fund these business models and enable the first commercial-scale deployment of low-carbon hydrogen production and industrial carbon capture. We have also announced the HyNet and East Coast clusters as track 1 economic hubs for green jobs We have previously announced that we will end the sale of all new non zero emission road vehicles from 2040, and the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. The strategy explains that we will also introduce a zero emission vehicle mandate that will deliver on our 2030 commitment to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans To increase the size of our carbon sinks, we will treble the rate at which we are planting new trees in England by the end of the current Parliament. We will be a global leader in developing and deploying the green technologies of the future. The strategy announces a £1.5 billion fund to support net zero innovation projects, which provides finance for low-carbon technologies across the areas of the Prime Minister’s “Ten Point Plan” We have also published our heat and buildings strategy, which sets out our plans to significantly cut carbon emissions from the UK’s 30 million homes and workplaces in a simple way that remains affordable and fair for British households. We will gradually move away from fossil fuel heating and improve the energy performance of our buildings through measures such as grants of up to £5,000 towards the costs of heat pumps, a further £800 million for the social housing decarbonisation fund to upgrade social housing, and a further £950 million for a home upgrade grant scheme to improve and decarbonise low-income homes off the gas grid The year 2021 is a vital year for action on climate change. In just two weeks’ time, the UK Government will host the crucial United Nations COP26 conference in Glasgow. As the Prime Minister has said, it needs to be a “turning point for humanity”, the point at which we pull together—and pull our socks up—to keep 1.5 °C in reach. Hosting COP26 will also give the UK a huge opportunity to showcase our world-leading climate credentials and set an example to other countries to raise their own ambitions. The net zero strategy will take centre stage in our display, setting out our vision for a UK that is cleaner, greener, and more innovative Mr Speaker, we are ready for Glasgow, and I commend this statement to the House.']","<|system|>

Mr. Marshal! Prime Minister! Ministers! High Izbo! Dear Friends of the Diplomatic Corps! Ladies and gentlemen! It is a great honor for me that as a representative of the government of the Republic of Poland, I can present today to the Sejm, gathered guests and citizens of our country information about the tasks of Polish foreign policy in 2016. Thank you for the presence of the President, who, in the field of foreign policy in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, cooperates with the President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Harmonious cooperation between the President and the Government regarding the difficult tasks facing us today is extremely important. This cooperation strengthens Poland\'s position. This is the first exposé of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the new cabinet. So it is my task to define the goals of Polish diplomacy not only for 2016, but also a broader vision of foreign policy, which we would like to pursue in the next four years. This is so important that, due to technological and social changes, armed conflicts, economic crises, migration in front of our eyes, the erosion of the old world order reaching the roots of the end of the Cold War or even further - the end of World War II. At the heart of this global uncertainty and instability, Europe, weakened by the recession, divided against the background of the various visions for the development of the European project and surrounded by wars just behind its threshold. This negative experience has also become a part of Poland, which is part of Europe and which since the beginning of its history shares with it the bottom and the misery. In the case of our country, this situation takes on a particular pronunciation, because despite the passage of a quarter of a century since we were freed from the communist system imposed on us, we cannot say that we have achieved all the goals that led to the Polish society in 1989. When we first joined NATO and later to the European Union, it seemed that we stood on some ground that we could forget the difficult dilemmas of a country located between the East and the West. Today, more than ever, we feel that we have been overly optimistic about our position. We have entered institutions that, although they are built on the strategic interests of the Member States in the community, do not remove the differences in national priorities, but only the debates around them include the civilised rules of the political game. Therefore, it is not enough to be a member of one international organisation or another, but it is important to actively, in a sense of subjectivity, shape its policy, pursue the interests of the Republic of Poland, ensure the real security and conditions of development for all citizens. The current government is determined to achieve these goals by leading a courageous and realistic, and above all, an effective foreign policy based on four premises. Firstly, we will seek to root foreign policy into the political will of sovereign states which, if they are united by a deep community of values and interests, are ready to work together jointly and severally to achieve common objectives. NATO and the European Union are growing from these sources. Secondly, we will base policy on the primacy of international law on brutal force, on the idea of a concert of powers dividing the world into zones of influence against the will of societies. Hence the Polish attachment to the principles of the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. We will act in the spirit of the motto formulated by President Andrzej Duda in the UN: Peace through law, the power of law above the law of force. [[Applause]] Thirdly, we will find a community of values of the democratic world, which creates a space uniting society around peaceful development and cooperation, regardless of cultural skills and historical experiences. This means that for the Republic of Poland the basis of common interests is above all the values which constitute the heritage of European civilization. These values are primarily Roman law, Greek philosophy and Christian ethics, rationalism, common good and respect for human rights. Defending these values and principles of our civilization will make sense of our diplomacy. [[Applause]] In this context, it should be recalled that Warsaw was and will continue to be the centre of dialogue on human rights and democracy. Here in the capital is the seat of the Community of Democracy, here is the International Conference of the Warsaw Dialogue for Democracy held annually, in our capital we host ODIHR, the Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, which organizes annual human dimension review meetings. The promotion of human rights and democracy was and will remain one of the priorities of Polish foreign policy. Fourthly, we are convinced that international relations, although sometimes seen as a sphere of brutal and destructive competition between countries, also create an area of economic exchange, mutual understanding of societies, including those very distant in terms of tradition and history. The idea of strategic partnership with non-European nations is emerging from this imperative. High Izbo! In 2016, the Council Poland will have to face three major crises that have hit Europe: the security crisis on our continent, the neighbourhood crisis and the crisis of the European project itself. Each of them can have very serious and far-reaching consequences for our country. This dimension of international relations, which is most worrying, is security. For several years we have seen a gradual, dramatic deterioration of the situation in the eastern and southern neighbourhood of the European Union, including directly at the borders of the Republic of Poland. The current international security system is being marginalized. Institutions such as the OSCE or regional organisations set up to release tensions through dialogue, conflict prevention or resolution on the basis of generally accepted principles shall be disregarded and ignored. This creates a policy-friendly ground for strength, which has brought so much misery to European societies in the 20th century. Our great neighbour\'s policy in the East, which aims to revise the post-war European order, raises the greatest concern. The new Security Strategy of the Russian Federation allows the use of force in the pursuit of its interests. The illustration of this logic is the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the war, which in fact has already been going on in this country for the second year. Russia is moving towards expanding its own sphere of influence and halting the democratic transformation of those Eastern European countries that are seeking closer relations with the West. It is a policy supported by the expansion of Russian military capabilities and hybrid activities, including propaganda. I regret to say that the naivety was the faith that one of my predecessors showed a few years ago, that Russia respects democratic values and principles of international law. Then he asked her to join NATO. Secondly, the deterioration of our security is strongly intertwined with the crisis of the European neighbourhood. Although Russian policy plays a destructive role in Eastern Europe, it is not the only one that is a source of concern. Corruption and the lack of consistent political and political and market reforms also have a negative impact on this region. In the southern neighbourhood, the same or similar phenomena have led to the collapse of countries such as Syria and Libya and have affected the stability of many other countries. The Middle East is in chaos, and the Middle East peace process suffers. To the south of Europe, the greatest problems are armed conflicts, terrorism, the distribution of state structures. The growing problem is the massive wave of labour migration and refugees. Action is needed to adapt Polish foreign policy and security policy to these challenges too. However, I would like to stress that Polish diplomacy, also using the development aid instrument, actively involving itself in solving the problems of Africa and the Middle East, will seek to maintain a proper balance between the involvement of our partners, allies from NATO and the European Union, in preventing and resolving problems in the eastern and southern neighbourhood. The third challenge for Polish diplomacy and Polish authorities in general is to face the crisis of the European project. We are a member of the European Union and our security and prosperity are directly affected by its condition. The Union\'s crisis is reflected in the Greek debt crisis and the prospect of leaving the UK. Mass violation of the rules at the external borders of the Schengen area threatens to unleash the entire system of freedom of travel within this area. Polish diplomacy will oppose the internal diversity of the Union, the idea of mini-Schengen or discrimination against Polish citizens living in EU countries. We will also oppose any solutions that would affect the interest of economic security of Poland and Polish companies. We hope that the Dutch Presidency will see these problems. The most important problems I have identified are complex and long-term. They impose an obligation on Polish diplomacy to increase activity so that Poland can eliminate emerging threats. That is why I will repeat what the Prime Minister said by presenting her exposé to the High House in November. The priority of the Polish government in the coming years will be to provide the state and citizens with a broad sense of security - understood both as classic military security and stability of our borders, and more broadly as economic security. [[Applause]] Mr. Marshal! Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, The North Atlantic Alliance remains the basis of Polish, European and transatlantic security. Due to the deteriorating situation in the eastern and southern flank, the role of the Alliance will be to strengthen the deterrent function and the ability to collective, solidarity-based defence against external assault. We hope that, as in the past, NATO will also be able to adapt strategically today in changing security conditions and geopolitical realities. Polish diplomacy does not spare efforts and initiatives to actively influence this process. The involvement of the President in this area is particularly valuable. This was shown by his participation in the successful November meeting of the leaders of the Eastern countries of NATO in Bucharest and his recent visit to the NATO Headquarters in Mons in Brussels. In the coming days, a number of visits by the Prime Minister to the capitals of our most important European partners are planned. The security of our region will be an important element of the Prime Minister\'s consultation before an important NATO defence meeting in February. Also rich is my international consultation calendar. The military reinforcement of the eastern flank of NATO, as advocated by Poland and other countries in our region, should remove from the calculation stormers of European peace the feeling of disbelief in the cohesion of the North Atlantic Alliance. The achievement of this goal will therefore eliminate the temptation to test NATO cohesion and will be a step towards reducing the risk of conflict. The strengthening of the Alliance should be of a lasting and long-term nature, as allies are a common collective obligation. This principle should be reflected in the upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw in July. [[Applause]] It is in Warsaw that we want the Alliance to confirm with practical steps the credibility of security guarantees, also in relation to the countries of its eastern flank. Our proposals in this area are now subject to alliance agreements. They tend to compensate for the obvious disparities between the so-called. old and new NATO members in terms of the state of defence infrastructure. In our discussions with allies, we stress that we do not demand privileges. We seek a level playing field for all NATO members throughout the Alliance. There is no and there can be no going back to the grey zones or the security vacuum in our part of the continent. Our allies, as well as our partners outside NATO, are clearly communicating and reminding: the Alliance\'s military infrastructure was not, is not and will not be a threat to anyone. Similarly, sovereign decisions by countries on future integration into the North Atlantic Alliance are not a threat. NATO\'s attractiveness and effectiveness also manifests itself in the power to attract possible new members. In this spirit, we are in favour of the Alliance maintaining an open door policy, provided that the expansion process serves to strengthen NATO\'s defence functions. Our goal is to further develop security cooperation with the United States, both bilateral cooperation and multilateral fora and, above all, NATO. [[Applause]] 2016 is the time of the transition to the implementation of the Polish-American missile shield agreement and the beginning of the construction of the missile shield base in Redzików. It is also another year of increasing the military presence of the United States in Poland, among others. for the purpose of military exercises of Anaconda. We will strive for a more permanent anchoring of elements of the U.S. armed forces in the territory of Poland. Such an opportunity is created, among others. U.S. weapons storage project in our country. In preparation for the NATO Summit in Warsaw, we expect strong support from the United States to strengthen the security of the Eastern Alliance flank. [[Applause]] Solidarity in our Alliance should apply equally to all directions. Once operations in Haiti, Afghanistan or Iraq needed support, today the Eastern NATO flank needs special attention. [[Applause]] Not only are the members of the Alliance, but also NATO partners face challenges and threats to the modern security environment. We want to develop and cultivate cooperation with these countries, strengthen their sense of security. In these categories, we think of partners from the nearest NATO environment, such as Finland, Sweden, Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, but we also think about Lebanon, Jordan or Iraq. It is no less important to maintain a relationship with politically close, strong partners located a little further, such as Australia, Japan and the Republic of Korea. High Izbo! Recognising the primary role of the Alliance in maintaining transatlantic security, we are in favour of closer and more effective cooperation between NATO and the European Union in solving complex international problems. Poland will engage in efforts to strengthen the common security and defence policy of the European Union. The more defensive elements, the better. From the point of view of the Polish state, it is necessary to develop common rapid response mechanisms within the Union. We are talking about the possibility for the European Union to carry out peace and stability missions and to ensure adequate civilian and military capabilities for this purpose. However, it is important that these solutions do not duplicate, and all the more so that they do not compete with the existing Atlantic Alliance. Regional cooperation with our Nordic, Baltic and Visegrad Group is particularly important in the current security environment. Through this cooperation, we should make both NATO and the European Union more sensitive to the north-eastern dimension of Europe\'s security. This year, together with our partners, we put at the disposal of the Union a fighting group capable of rapid intervention. It consists of less than 4 thousand. soldiers, including half from Poland. Focusing on the problems in our part of the continent, we also see the importance of the threat from the so-called. The Islamic State. Poland is a member of a global coalition fighting this criminal group. We support allies and partners in the fight against international terrorism. We remind in this context that the defence is also due to religious minorities, especially Christians. [[Applause]] We are also involved in providing humanitarian aid to the victims of the terrorist war. I\'ll mention a plane with humanitarian aid to Jordan before Christmas. We will continue this process. Next week, the Prime Minister will also make an appropriate contribution to the London Donor Conference for Syria. We intend to respond in a concrete way to requests addressed to us by the United States and France. The Minister for National Defence has already conducted appropriate consultations. Our ambition is to expand our commitment to the safety of the international environment. In this spirit, we are seeking a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council in the years 2018 and 2019. This status involves responsibility, but also prestige, an opportunity to promote more extensive experience in the area of democratic and systemic transformation. We are working on increasing Poland\'s participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Poland has been an active participant in peace missions for many years and we want to return to this good tradition. However, possible decisions in this area will be taken with caution and responsibility for the lives of our soldiers and the security of the mission. Ladies and gentlemen! Far-sighted and ambitious Eastern policy is one of the most important dimensions of the foreign policy of the Polish state. The challenges posed by the Eastern direction for our and European security fully justify this point of view. It is in Poland\'s interest that Eastern European societies, in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Charter of the United Nations and the OSCE, should have the right to have a sovereign choice of way of development, political system and alliances without fear of their own security. Only in this way will Eastern Europe cease to be a source of concern and become a stable region on sound foundations. Our aim therefore remains to support the stabilisation processes of those countries that wish to do so and to establish a proper relationship with partners who do not always and not always share our point of view in every area. One way of implementing such a outlined policy is to make effective use of the available European instrument. In this area, the idea of creating a new instrument for the positive impact of the European Union on its eastern neighbourhood remains crucial. Together with regional partners, we will take into account all the positive aspects of the Eastern Partnership and add new elements that will contribute to increasing regional cooperation. I have already started talking about this with my partners from Sweden, Finland, Lithuania and Romania. We hope that the entry into force of the Association Agreements with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine and the green light on the part of the European Commission for the visa waiver for the citizens of Georgia and Ukraine will contribute to the stabilisation of the region and will encourage the development of regional cooperation. In line with the spirit of an individualised approach, we will also support Europe\'s cooperation with Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan. High Izbo! In the interest of Poland and Europe there are pragmatic and factual relations with the Russian Federation. This is not an easy task, given the different approaches to international relations, which our neighbours consider not as a sphere of cooperation, but as a sphere of geopolitical competition in which the use of force is entitled. However, we believe, like our Western partners, that even under these conditions it is in our interest to maintain open channels of communication with Moscow. Such an approach is manifested, among others. consultations at the level of the foreign vice-ministers which took place a week ago. However, cooperation with Russia should be built not on the basis of unilateral concessions, but in a spirit of constructive dialogue, respect for bilateral agreements and international law. That is why, in relations with the Russian Federation, we aim to balance relations and also to take into account our interests and expectations. Mutual trust, so needed in relations between countries, is built up through concrete gestures. From a Polish point of view such gestures can be: reliable cooperation in explaining the causes of the Smoleńsk catastrophe, returning the wreckage of the presidential aircraft and declassifying to the end the archives concerning the crimes committed by Stalin on Polish officers. [[Applause]] The bilateral agreement on these matters would be a positive step and would prevent the need to seek international solutions. For Russia, I will repeat the words of President Andrzej Duda: Poland has no eternal enemies. Despite the difficult history, we managed to build friendship relations with Germany. In Poland many believe and hope that a similar process is possible in relations with Russia. We are therefore ready to resume contact with Moscow in substance, which would lead to the resolution of some specific issues. We have shown our readiness by recently sending a diplomatic mission at the working level. Experimental meetings, e.g. The civil dialogue forum could also improve the mutual atmosphere. Polish diplomacy will participate in the creation of a joint and consistent policy of the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance towards Russia. Our consistent position should take into account the Russian behaviour towards both the Union and NATO as well as the individual Member States and our strategic partners. We do not oppose the convening of the NATO-Russia Council, provided that one of its topics is the Crimean issue and the war in the east of Ukraine. [[Applause]] High Izbo! It is in Poland\'s interest to promote the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. The democratic, politically and economically stable Ukrainian state is an important element of European order and security built after the transformations of the years 1989 and 1991. In the last two years, the independence of our eastern neighbor, as never before in the last quarter of a century, has been severely tested. The scale of pressure, pressure, attempts to destabilize is also consistent with the scale of freedom and democratic aspirations of the Ukrainian people. Pro-European reforms, for which the Ukrainian people voted for in Euro-Maidan, need support for the Western world and the active involvement of Poland. This commitment was declared by President Andrzej Duda during his first official visit to Ukraine in December 2015. Mr Antoni Macierewicz also paid a visit to Kiev in December. We will help Ukraine, but at the same time we will require effective use of this assistance. We support our Ukrainian partners in the most important areas of modern state organization, such as the creation of a system of local self-governments, deregulation, the fight against corruption, the construction of efficient state administration, but also the settlement of difficult and painful historical issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs advises and assists in the preparation of draft legal acts, as well as the training of officials. We provide assistance to those who have forced their war efforts to leave their former homes. In 2016, we plan to continue the implementation of humanitarian and development projects for victims of the war in the east of Ukraine. Poland has wide open the door to hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens who, for material reasons or because of lack of security, want or must seek their place outside their homeland. We will seek consistent implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement and the Deep Free Trade Agreement. Closer economic cooperation and competition between Ukrainian companies and European companies on the same basis will be the best incentive to implement reforms that permanently modernise the Ukrainian economy. They will also be a realistic response to attempts to destabilize the situation in this country. An additional instrument for building our solidarity with Ukraine will be the introduction of visa-free travel to the European Union for the citizens of the country. In support of Ukrainian reforms, we also work with non-European countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. High Izbo! We look with hope at the revival of the European Union-Belarus relationship. Polish diplomacy does not intend to interfere with any country\'s policy. However, we expect, especially from our neighbours, only compliance with the standards set by law and international organisations. The release of political prisoners by the Belarusian authorities is a step in the right direction - respect for international standards. However, if we want to go further this way, we will need further joint action. We are counting on the activation of cooperation in the field of infrastructure, including improving the capacity of border crossing points and simplifying passenger traffic rules, in particular through the implementation of the Small Border Traffic Agreement. At the same time, we are aware that we will not avoid difficult issues in the dialogue with Minsk. The problems of the Polish minority in Belarus will remain high on our agenda. I hope to discuss these matters soon in Minsk. We do not lose hope of success in the reform process in Moldova. An important area of economic and political cooperation is for the Polish state of the South Caucasus, whose diversity requires a well balanced activity from us. Georgia is consistently taking further steps towards closer relations with the European Union and NATO. We are definitely helping Tbilisi in this regard. We maintain our interest in launching the Tbilisian Conference launched in April 2015, which is based on the model of the Utrecht and Kopi Conference, with the aim of transferring experiences for the European integration of Georgia with the European Union on the basis of an association agreement. We will also work on further development of dialogue with Armenia and Azerbaijan. High Seym! The debate on the future of the European Union - the European Union in shocks - is of fundamental importance today, where integration projects, such as the single currency, excessive regulation and economic governance are not always relevant. This is where the causes of the Greek crisis must be sought and the idea of increasing integration by the United Kingdom is questioned. In both cases, unity and coherence of the Union have been put into question. Poland is a beneficiary of European unity. The cracks that have appeared on the structure successfully built for decades are undesirable and dangerous. We want to create a Union of free nations, equal states, jointly and economically competitive, with authority in the world. [[Applause]] However, we believe that the EU does not have a two-speed path to this end, i.e. the strengthening of economic and political cooperation by the countries of the euro area. An alternative to the efficient and respectful subjectivity of all the Member States of the European Union is the system of concerts of powers with which Poland has historically bad experiences. At the same time, we see and point out what is flawed in the European project. It is difficult for us to accept the departure of the Union from the Treaty rules in search of ad hoc results, to delegate decision-making and enforcement powers in various policies to informal bodies, to decisions taken without consulting other partners. We see attempts to shift some of the effects of these decisions to countries that did not participate in the process of drawing them up, and which are then faced with facts made. The lack of respect for equality and the subjectivity of non-powerful Member States is a wrong way - it weakens the will of European nations to continue the process of integration and undermines its achievements so far. It is in the interest of the Republic of Poland that the European Union is coherent. However, this cohesion must be supported by the citizens of the Member States. A practice based on the principle: more Europe, less democratic control of its activities, leads to erosion rather than strengthening the integration process. [[Applause]] In our reasonable concern for his success, we must urge our EU partners to see the danger behind it. The echo of the dispute over the future shape of the Union is the criticism of changes in Poland by some European politicians. In fact, the dispute is not so much about the content of this or another law adopted by the Polish Parliament, but rather about the extent of interference by the European institutions in the internal affairs of the Member States. [[Applause]] In other words, it is the extent of sovereignty of the Republic of Poland and other Member States. In this case Poland\'s right state is unambiguous - it is in Poland\'s interest to have a lasting and strong sovereignty, harmoniously entering into the Treaty-based European construction. It is worth to understand the essence of this dispute in Poland. The European Union should return to its roots, to four fundamental freedoms: freedom of movement for people, services, goods and capital. Supporters of close integration of the euro area want coordination of economic governance and de facto political union. Unfortunately, there is no fair and democratic way of identifying reliable authorities for such a political union today. However, we still have much to do in implementing these very fundamental principles of the common market. After all, we are far from the common market for services, the principle of freedom of movement of goods is difficult to implement with regard to energy raw materials, the question marks appear with regard to the freedom of movement of persons. It may sometimes be felt that the idea of political union, referred to as the English term ever closer union, is treated as a way of escaping forward, as if they wanted to hide the mistakes made in connection with the common currency and recently also with the migration crisis. The principle of subsidiarity is the victim of such an attitude. This is how some European politicians want to impose mandatory amounts of migrants on Member States and even intend to set up a European border guard, acting independently of their will. Our aim is to restore in European policy the right place the principle of subsidiarity, which is the best guarantee of balance between the prerogatives of the EU institutions, often suffering from a clear democratic deficit, and the competences of the Member States whose governments draw their power without exception directly from their citizens\' electoral decisions. [[Applause]] Mr. Marshal! Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, Regional cooperation is an integral part of Polish European policy. We have high hopes for her, but we also see the problems we will face. Central Europe has fallen victim to the migration crisis. Rational and appropriate actions from today\'s perspective were initially criticized by many European politicians before they were considered justified. The idea of closer European integration, i.e. the so-called. Small Schengen is addressed primarily to the countries of the old Europe. Our region is not considered. We will protest against such solutions. The current government will run a regional policy emerging from the special position of Poland in Europe. Our country connects large European areas - a widely understood region of the Baltic Sea and Central Europe with the Balkan countries, to the Adriatic Sea. Not only will we be present in different formats of cooperation within different regions, but we will also strive to ensure that through our country north and south Europe is closer to each other in order to create a new regional identity within the European Union. In the political sphere, this is reflected in the summit of nine Central European leaders organised in Bucharest on the initiative of Poland and Romania, our important regional ally. In the economic and communication sphere, we will endeavour to ensure that Via Carpatia becomes the buckle connecting the various parts of Europe in the area of infrastructure development. We will also pursue, promote further infrastructure initiatives in the countries connected by the Carpathian massif. The Visegrad Group, built as a model and benefiting from the Benelux experience, is a proven element of European architecture and a format of joint representation of the interests of the region of Central and Eastern Europe. This year\'s anniversary, the quarter-century of the group\'s existence, makes us aware of the scale of our region\'s success. Poland will take over the annual presidency from mid 2016 onwards. Within this framework, we will seek to make Europe\'s agenda, defence, energy security, cohesion policy and infrastructure more effective and cooperative. We will be looking for synergies with the efforts of the Slovak Presidency in the Council of the European Union, e.g. on the review of Union budgetary issues, the development of the digital market, the Energy Union, the migration crisis or the situation in Ukraine. Cooperation with Visegrad partners will also be developed in the bilateral arrangement, among others. through the organisation of a number of intergovernmental consultations with the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Close cooperation with the third important partner of Visegrad, Hungary, will find expression, among others. in a joint celebration of the 60th anniversary of the events of 1956 - in June in Poznań and October in Budapest. Thanks to the decision of our parliaments, we will also celebrate the year of solidarity in relation to the events of those days. With equal energy, we will engage in cooperation with our neighbours in the north, especially in the area of security policy, the European agenda, as well as in extensive sectoral cooperation. We are also working together using multilateral channels, which is supported by the current Polish Presidency of the Baltic Sea Council. Poland wants to be a responsible partner, which combines, unites around common values and ideas. That is why we value dialogue in the format of Visegrad Group, Nordic and Baltic States. Poland is currently chaired by the Baltic Sea Council of States. The Forum increasingly serves as a platform for exchange of experience between countries with varying potential and degree of economic development. We also attach great importance to bilateral cooperation with the countries of the region, as evidenced by, among other things, the fact that we are working together on a bilateral basis. my first visits to Stockholm and Helsinki. High Izbo, we will maintain dialogue and regular consultation at different levels with the most important European partners. First of all, with Great Britain, which brings us not only to understand many important elements of the European agenda, but also to take a similar approach to European security problems. The common perception of European problems has been confirmed, among others. during my recent visit to the United Kingdom. At the same time, I would like to stress with all my power: there will be no agreement by the Polish authorities to violate one of the foundations of the Union, i.e. the right of citizens of the European Union to move freely within the Union, [[Applause]] also because of the importance of labour mobility for a strong single market in global competition. We will not accept solutions which would result in discrimination against our countrymen in any Member State of the European Union. [[Applause]] High Izbo, Poland will continue friendly relations with Germany, our most important neighbour and economic partner. This year it is 25 years since the signing of the Treaty on good neighbourhood and friendly cooperation between Poland and the Federal Republic. This is a good time for a positive reflection on the common interest in Europe, because, contrary to some opinions and stereotypes, we have a great deal in common. But it\'s also a good opportunity for a little neighborhood repertoire. [[Applause]] Polish-German contacts will be even better if they are accompanied by honesty and openness, not pretended, sometimes superficial co-ordination. [[Applause]] Such a spirit of sincerity and openness to cooperation was accompanied by recent visits by President Andrzej Duda and mine in Berlin, as well as a visit by Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier in Warsaw. We will also maintain a good atmosphere during the next visit of Prime Minister Beata Szydło in Berlin. The 25th anniversary of the Weimar Triangle was also celebrated this year and will be the basis for summing up the cooperation with France and Germany so far and setting new directions. Paris will continue to remain an important reference point for us in European and political and military matters. Italy, Spain and the Netherlands, which started the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in January, will be among the most important European partners of the Republic of Poland. High Izbo, I just mentioned the immigration crisis and its European dimension. However, the reasons for this should not be sought in Europe. Polish foreign policy does not ignore the problems of the South. We view the region of Africa and the Middle East as an area with both opportunities and serious challenges. Political instability, regional conflicts, terrorism, uncontrolled migration, the activities of large organised criminal groups - these are just a few of the main phenomena, the problems of this region. Because of their scale and nature, they pose a direct challenge to European security, thereby involving the European Union\'s forces and resources. The migration and refugee crisis is one of the most serious challenges for Poland and Europe. It should be assumed that further weakening of the state structures and poverty of the societies there will generate further migratory waves to Europe. These issues will involve Poland both globally, within the UN, the Union and NATO as well as bilaterally. In order to combat the negative effects of the current crisis, the European Union must first and foremost regain control of the movement of people arriving in Europe. The effective protection of the Union\'s external borders is a prerequisite for reducing migratory pressures. This will allow you to exit the permanent crisis response mode. We will therefore examine the European Commission\'s proposals for the management of the external borders of the Union while respecting the principle of respect for the competences of the Member States. We will also stress that improving border protection can also be achieved by fully implementing and improving the existing cooperation mechanisms of national border services. Not only does Poland play an important role in the protection of the Union\'s external borders due to its geopolitical position. In addition to the obvious tasks carried out on its own territory, more than 100 border guards served in other countries of the European Union. It will be no different this year. Polish bordermen are also working in Slovenia and Greece. In order to effectively combat migratory pressures, well-targeted cooperation with third countries is also needed, among others. Turkey. A package of actions agreed at the end of November. between the Union and Ankara offers opportunities to temporarily halt the wave of refugees. Poland will contribute financially to the implementation of this agreement. However, strong action is also needed in other sensitive areas of the southern neighbourhood. The measures and decisions taken so far to relocate refugees within the Union have not produced the expected results. They were merely a response to the increasing influx of refugees into Europe without affecting the causes of the phenomenon outside the Union. Poland has consistently implemented migration policy. As I have already mentioned, since the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, our country has received more and more citizens from this country. There was a double increase between 2014 and 2015. As regards the relocation of refugees, we do not shirk the commitments made by the previous government, but we will consistently maintain the fundamental principles of security. The necessary condition for receiving refugees in Poland will be full verification of the identity of the persons concerned, as well as maintaining the principle of full voluntary choice of Poland as the destination country. Ladies and gentlemen! In a modern international environment, the importance of an economic factor is growing as an element influencing relations between countries. It has a strong impact on the assessment of safety conditions and on how the national interest is perceived. Today Poland is strongly linked to the European market, which accounts for more than 60% of our foreign turnover. On the one hand, it is pleased that Polish entrepreneurs are doing great on one of the most difficult markets in the world, on the other, that we are so strongly dependent on the economy of one economic area. The current government will therefore consistently support the development of economic cooperation with partners outside Europe. It will also support entrepreneurs operating outside our country. It is estimated that in 2016 thanks to their hard work and talents, the growth of Polish exports can be up to 10%. Together with the Ministry of Development, the Ministry of Agriculture and other central offices, we will improve the instruments of economic diplomacy. The implemented business satisfaction research system will help us to identify the needs and preferences of Polish business. The promotion of technological cooperation will be an important feature of the activities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Polish economy needs partners to optimally involve one of the most valuable capital - intellectual capital. Building a knowledge-based economy requires the support of Polish companies and research and science institutions in relations with countries that have achieved spectacular successes in commercialization of highly advanced technologies. We will continue training to increase the participation of Polish companies in tenders and projects of international organisations. We note with satisfaction that more and more companies participate in such trainings and workshops. Our intention is to use these organizations to support the foreign expansion of our companies. At the same time, I declare the openness of Polish diplomacy to initiatives of Polish economic environments, if they are interested and focused on strengthening Polish economic presence abroad. I plan meetings myself in the near future, a series of meetings with representatives of the most important Polish business organizations. Several geographical orientations deserve particular emphasis here. In relations with the United States, our partnership increasingly includes the economic dimension, energy cooperation and a promising area of innovation and the development of high technologies. Polish-American economic relations are part of the European Union\'s economic partnership with the United States, which we intend to develop for the benefit of our parties in the framework of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, so-called. TTIP. The current government is taking action to maintain the dynamics of expansion of Polish companies towards Asia. It will be particularly important to strengthen cooperation with the countries with which we have established strategic partnerships - with Japan and Korea. We are successfully developing cooperation in this partner format with the People\'s Republic of China, also as part of the 16+1 initiative, i.e. between the countries of Środowo-Eastern Europe and China. A recent visit by President Andrzej Duda was an important event for the development of relations with this country. Initiatives of a regional and global nature, such as one belt, one trail, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, can bring tangible benefits to Poland through the handling of freight exchanges between Europe and Asia and the inflow of investment. I hope that we will continue to be able to implement our initiatives during my first Asian visit to China and during the Chinese President\'s visit to Warsaw. Among the important partners on the Asian continent are ASEAN and India. We also want to expand economic cooperation with Asia by restoring diplomatic posts in countries such as Mongolia and the Philippines. We will strengthen economic cooperation with Latin American and Caribbean countries. Democratic change, economic and social stability, the progressive liberalisation of trade with the Union and the strong and well-established presence of Polonia should foster this in this region. Economic cooperation in this direction may also be conducive to the restoration of our facilities in Panama and Ecuador. In the area of international economic cooperation, we will attach particular importance to energy policy. In December 2015, the LNG terminal in Świnoujście started operations... [[Voice from the room: Ah, yet he began.]] ...a project initiated by the Government with the participation of the Law and Justice in 2007... [[Ha, ha, ha, funny.]] ...making Poland more energy independent and opening up new opportunities for cooperation with exporters of this raw material. A breakthrough in the diversification of gas supply lines does not mean that the Republic should attach less importance to energy policy in Europe. The Polish strategy involves two-track actions on investment projects in the country and steps taken at EU level. The Energy Union project from the conceptual phase must move into a realization phase. Following the December European Council conclusions in the coming weeks, we expect an ambitious legislative package in the area of security of gas supply. We\'re critical of the project. Nord Stream II, [[Applause]] an economically inefficient idea to increase the European Union\'s dependence on supply from the same direction. This pipeline, reducing the transit importance of Slovakia and Ukraine, would undermine not only the economic interests of our southern ally, but also our eastern partner. In this sense, it is contrary to the international commitments of UN and OSCE Member States not to support aggression in any form. In fact, Nord Stream II is therefore not a business but a political undertaking. Poland will be actively involved in shaping European climate policy. This was already apparent at the recent Paris climate summit. The agreement adopted does not run counter to our national interests, and in particular it does not, in our view, provide a basis for increasing the EU\'s reduction target by 2030. Poland will seek first accession and ratification by the world\'s largest economies. Following the COP21 conference, EU-wide negotiations on previously agreed emission reductions by 2030 are becoming a priority. [[Applause]] Economic interests, as well as efforts to gain support for our candidacy to the UN Security Council, require an increase in the activity of Polish diplomacy in Africa and the Middle East. Depending on the developments, we are considering reopening our facilities in Baghdad, Damascus and Tripoli. Using close relations with the Israeli and Palestinian authorities, we will also support international efforts to resume dialogue in the Middle East peace process. The continuing interest of Polish tourists in trips to Egypt and Tunisia puts these countries among our important partners. As an important economic partner, Algeria maintains its position. We deserve greater interest in the politically stable and influential countries around Morocco and Jordan, countries with privileged status in relations with the Union and offering concrete benefits for Polish companies. Poland will also remain an important partner for the Gulf countries. In 2016 we will take steps to obtain serious investments for Poland from the countries of the region. The main tasks are to deepen cooperation with Saudi Arabia and Qatar, countries of importance for diversification of energy supplies to Poland. We see great potential in the development of relations with Iran, against which the European Union has recently abolished economic sanctions. A special place on the map of Polish interests in the Middle East is preserved by the United Arab Emirates, our most important contractor in the Arab world. We are going to continue and develop the program ""Go Africa."" We will strive to increase the Polish economic presence on the African continent. This should be facilitated by the restoration of the network of Polish diplomatic offices in Africa. First, embassies should be launched in Senegal and Tanzania, and perhaps in the near future in Zambia. In 2016, relations with four priority countries for Polish development cooperation will be strengthened, namely Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia and Senegal. South Africa will remain an important partner in Africa. High Seym! Today, as it is estimated, even 20 million of our compatriots or people with Polish roots live outside Poland. Of course, we do not want more hundreds of thousands of Poles to leave Poland in search of their life chances, as it has been in the last few years. We want them to have the right conditions to live here. I recently appealed to the Polish community in Edinburgh to return to the country. [[Voice from the room: What do you think?]] At the same time, in the presence of such a large Polish community outside the country we see an opportunity to actively promote Polish interests. We want Poles living outside the borders to be spokespersons of interests of the Republic to meet the challenges we face today. [[Applause]] We expect that, through close cooperation with Polish diplomatic and consular offices, our compatriots will be an important ally of the government in promoting the Polish state, Polish culture and national memory, Polish historical narrative. Polish institutes abroad will actively support Polonia in these activities. I appeal to Poland: respond, please, when the good name of Poland is slandered, when our history is misconstrued or even lied, when it is written about Polish extermination camps, and it is silent about thousands of Poles of the Righteous among the Nations of the World. [[Applause]] Please be ambassadors of Poland and Polishness. I particularly appeal to Poland in allies to support Polish efforts to improve our level of security. Polish policy will be implemented not only for Polonia, but mainly with the participation of Polonia. We will develop a network of Polish consultative councils operating at Polish institutions abroad, we will support Polish organizations, but above all we will support Polish media and education, which are carriers of Polish culture and national tradition. This year we intend to support the activities of the Ministry of National Education, so that more teachers are addressed to Polish communities in the East. We intend to make important changes to the Polish Charter. We want to make it much easier for people who claim to belong to the Polish people and who have Polish roots to settle in Poland, integrate with the country of ancestors and obtain Polish citizenship. [[Applause]] We intend to prepare a new act on repatriation, which not on paper, but in a real way will enable Poland to fulfil its obligations towards those whose homeland was taken by force. [[Applause]] Our fellow countrymen in the East, especially in Lithuania, Belarus, can count on our special support in Kazakhstan. We will ask for the rights of Poles wherever they are not properly respected, using, if necessary, multilateral forums. We want Polonia and Poles in neighbouring countries and everywhere where there are large national communities to gain all the rights that result from bilateral agreements and European standards. This includes: increasing the availability of Polish language teaching, especially by children of school age. Poles abroad, once again, must be treated like all other citizens of the European Union. [[Applause]] Mr. Marshal! Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, A special mission for Poland and Poles is carried out by the consular service under my command. For years, it has carried out rapid and effective evacuations of our citizens from many distant countries. Ministry of Foreign Affairs also supported the Ministry of National Defence and Internal Affairs. Due to the war activities in the east of Ukraine threatening the lives of the residents of Donbas, residents of Polish origin last year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the support of the MON and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs organized a group of 178 people to bring to Poland. In November 2015, another 180 people from Mariupola were brought to Poland. The last 7 people are expected to arrive in the coming days. The successful release of kidnapped Poles in several places around the world was also a success. These examples confirm the effectiveness of the consular service and strengthen citizens\' confidence in the state. Action in the area of visa policy was a significant success for the consular service. In 2015, Polish consular offices issued a record number of over 1.5 million visas, of which over 900 thousand. It\'s in Ukraine, and it\'s in 400,000. Belarus. Responding to the growing interest in Poland, we will take care of the correctness of the process of applying for Polish visas. An effective visa policy is an important tool to support the development of economic and trade, cultural and social contacts in our immediate neighbourhood. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, In 2016 Poland will host major international events with significant promotional potential. I already mentioned the NATO summit in Warsaw. An important task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also be the promotion of Poland related to World Youth Day organized in Krakow. We will show Poland as an important, inspiring and significant country in the history of Christianity and Europe. Let the involvement of the Polish state in this event be part of what could be termed diplomacy of values, defence and promotion of the values of Latin civilization, which brings together the citizens of our continent. [[Applause]] We also remember that this year Wrocław is the European Capital of Culture. This is another opportunity to remind the Polish contribution to the development of Europe, to its heritage. I will also strive that close to my heart Łódź also wins the right to organize the so-called. a small Expo exhibition in the near future. [[Applause]] In 2016 we will strengthen Polish historical diplomacy. We will effectively promote the history of our country, nation and state in the perspective of this year\'s 1050th anniversary of Poland\'s baptism as well as the forthcoming 100th anniversary of regaining independence. Reformed Polish institutes will play an important role in this process. An equally important priority is to strengthen the fight against negative stereotypes and slandering Poland. An example of the actions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in this field will be promotional and media support for the upcoming opening of the Museum of Poles Saving Jews. The Ulm families in Markowa near Rzeszow. [[Applause]] We will inform the foreign public more effectively about the most important Polish issues. Currently we are dealing with attacks on the image of Poland and the government of the Republic of Poland, with misinformation of foreign readers and attempts to create in them a belief that democracy is threatened in Poland. Therefore, for the sake of our country\'s good name, we will be conducting active media diplomacy, which was a good example of which the recent publication of my article ""What Europe does Poland want in 26 most important opinion-making European journals"" was a good example. This will also be served, among others. Poland information portal. en. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to develop a mechanism to support the local and civil dimension of Polish foreign policy. Thanks to it, cooperation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and regions is improving, and this in turn brings the priorities of Polish foreign policy closer to local communities, contributing to the development of civil society. We will continue to provide citizens with direct access to information on foreign affairs and international activities through the network of regional centres of international debate. High Seym! Polish foreign policy regains its subjectivity, which has been missing for the last few years and from which some of our partners have become accustomed. This is where we should look at the sources of polemic opinions about Poland, which have recently come from various European politicians. However, Poland\'s foreign policy will remain an assertive policy, which does not mean that it will be a conflict policy. Poland does not intend to strengthen relations with any foreign partner. Her policy will be firm, but also open to dialogue. The necessary correction in foreign policy, which this government will carry out, will be carried out for the benefit of Poland, for our region and for Europe. We are facing difficult challenges. In times of dramatic change, uncertainty and instability in international relations, strengthening the position of the Republic requires particular care and effort. To this end, harmonious cooperation between the most important centres of power - the President, Parliament and the Government is essential. There\'s room for the opposition here, too. [[Thank you.]] The sovereignty of the country is created not only through activities carried out abroad... [[Grace.]] ...it is also forged, and maybe mostly in its own country. I ask the High House to accept government information about the tasks of Polish foreign policy in 2016. Thank you very much. [[Long-term applause]]', 'Mr. President! Mr. Marshal! Dear Prime Minister, Fellow Ministers! High Izbo! Excellency! Ambassadores! Ladies and gentlemen! When I presented the government\'s information about the tasks of Polish foreign policy for the first time a year ago as Minister of Foreign Affairs, there was no lack of concern in my speech, pessimistic assessments of the international environment. I was talking about three crises which Poland must face: the security crisis, the crisis of the neighbourhood and the crisis of the European project. It was a good diagnosis. These three issues were at the heart of European policy in Europe in 2016, creating an extremely complex and unfavorable situation for Polish interests. In these difficult conditions, however, Polish diplomacy passed the exam perfectly, we fully accomplished the tasks put before the government a year ago. After 12 months, we can safely say that Poland has become more secure. The policy of the nearest neighbourhood, including Eastern Europe, has also taken on positive dynamics. In the Union itself, in the debate on the future of the European project, our voice is heard and our arguments are taken into account. We could see that during the last visit of Chancellor Angela Merkel in Warsaw. Polish foreign policy has also changed its nature. We have restored its subjectivity and the right hierarchy of priorities, taking the broad interests of our country as a starting point. It is to them that we have devoted a lot of attention and action. Instead of standing on the sidelines and rooting for the main players, we ourselves entered the international game on the international arena. Turns out we can develop tactics... [[Soccer games aren\'t everything.]] ...to make arguments and convince them to be right. We can withstand the first wave of resentment, attacks, even assaults, build coalitions and win. [[Great Britain.]] This was the case with regard to the missile shield, the presence of NATO-Wskie troops in Poland and the problem of migration. But I want to be well understood. The subjective treatment of Polish interests does not exclude concern for the future of a united Europe, for the security of its borders, for the stability of the European neighbourhood, and finally for strong and strong transatlantic relations. There is no contradiction between these goals. Our foreign policy is a citizen\'s policy. The point of this formulation is to recognise the aspirations and needs of Polish citizens in a foreign dimension. The strength of our foreign policy lies in our social mandate. In international matters, as in national cases, we have set out the objectives for which our citizens care and we are defending them. In order to achieve the goals of Polish foreign policy, we make effective use of bilateral cooperation mechanisms. Would our voice in NATO be equally audible without the close relations we have with the United States and Great Britain? Would the development of our economy be stable without Germany\'s great economic partner? Would we have a greater impact on European issues without active and dynamic regional policy? In no case would this be possible without our allies both in Europe and on the other side of the Atlantic. In the 21st century, security is becoming the common good of all mankind. The effects of crises even in the outermost regions are rapidly known in Europe, at the borders of the Republic of Poland. Therefore, Poland is involved in security initiatives not only of our country or of the region, but also of Europe and the world. This is why we are present in NATO-EU and EU missions in Afghanistan, Kosovo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Our soldiers serve as part of the global anti-terrorist coalition. Polish policy is jointly and severally responsible. International stability and mutually beneficial relations with other countries are fundamental conditions for international economic activity. The support of Polish entrepreneurs belongs to the priorities of Polish diplomacy. Gentlemen today, but also ladies - I had the opportunity recently to listen to the debate between Prime Minister Beata Szydło and Chancellor Angela Merkel - talk about money and devote much more time to it than golfing. It is with the aim of expanding Polish companies that we strengthen and expand our diplomatic presence in the world. We try to be present also in these parts of the world, where memory and love for the family country is present in the hearts and minds of the Polish people and Poles abroad. We build partnerships with them, support Polish education and teaching Polish language. When necessary, we defend their civil rights. Polonia is and will remain part of our collective consciousness. [[Voice from the room: Doubtful.]] We are still too often dealing with cases of intentional or unintended deception of facts from the history of Poland, especially cases of presenting victims of World War II as perpetrators or accomplices. We will strive to put an end to the lies and historical manipulations and the atmosphere of their consent. There would be no success of Polish foreign policy if not for harmonious cooperation between different state institutions. Therefore, from this point of view, I would like to express my thanks to the President, the Prime Minister and the Ministers for their assistance and support. High Izbo! Last year brought decisions beneficial for the international security of Poland. The July NATO summit in Warsaw decided to strengthen the eastern flank militaryly. The Alliance has thus confirmed its readiness to fulfil its core mission, collective defence, also in our region. These decisions represent a real strengthening of Poland\'s security. Our boundaries are safe, we don\'t have to put fences on them. However, we have set up warning signs with the inscription ""Attention!"" The territory of the Republic of Poland. Thousands of soldiers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and Canada along with modern military equipment will support the defence efforts of Poland and the Baltic States in the event of a possible threat. In mid-January this year, the first U.S. troops reached our country. Allied obligations under Article. The 5th Washington Treaty is thus gaining credibility. NATO and the European Union have decided to step up their cooperation. The declaration signed in July Ub became the expression of the will to cooperate. R. here, in Warsaw. Polish diplomacy has made an important contribution to building bridges between these organisations. An example of this is the conference organized from the Polish initiative in November ub. in Brussels, with the participation of Vice-President Federica Mogherini and myself and my recent participation in the panel on European security during the World Economic Forum in Davos, together with Federica Mogherini and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. Polish diplomacy took an active part in all discussions concerning not only the Euro-Atlantic security but also the future of the European Union. Despite initial doubts, the Polish vote on the migration crisis and the need for reform of the Union has been recognised and recognised by our partners. In response to the United Kingdom\'s intention to leave the European Union, we have taken successful action to maintain enhanced cooperation with this country. Relations with Germany were extremely intense, as demonstrated by five meetings of presidents, three meetings of heads of government and my constant contact with a German colleague. We have revived relations with our closest partners in the region - within the Visegrad Group, with the Baltic and Nordic countries. We started an intensive dialogue with countries located between the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea. Organized in August Ub. On the initiative of the presidents of Poland and Croatia, the summit of the Tri-marine states in Dubrovnik showed significant political and economic potential of the entire region. A similar sound was given by the November meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Central, South-Eastern and Balkans countries in Warsaw with the participation of Federica Mogherini. Poland has made an important contribution to the development of EU migration policy, as reflected in the decisions of the informal EU summit in Bratislava, as well as in shaping our energy reality in our part of Europe. The stabilisation of our neighbourhood and, more broadly, the European neighbourhood is a key task for Poland. Hence, among others. results in our activity in relations with Ukraine and Belarus, but also in relations with the countries of the Middle East and decisions on military engagement in the region. In order to maintain the balance between the various elements of foreign policy, Poland has made a profound return in its non-European policy, opening strongly to cooperation with countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East. From this point of view, the visit of the President of Poland to China and the President of the People\'s Republic of China in Poland was of considerable practical importance, especially in economic terms. Finally, it is important to mention the international success, which, regardless of the spiritual and religious dimension, has become the World Youth Days in Cracow with the participation of the Holy Father Francis. High Seym! The year 2017 will be largely marked by the same challenges we faced last year, although slightly different accents will spread. We will also have to take into account the new trends that have emerged recently. What is causing much discussion today, but also uncertainty, is the future of international order on a global scale. In 2016, there were voices saying that after decades the post-war era ended, at the threshold of which the creators of the United Nations Charter promised to protect future generations from the disasters of war and restore faith in fundamental human rights, equality between nations, big and small. Are we really facing dramatic, inevitable changes in international order? It is true that since 1945 much has changed in the global system of forces. The Cold War has passed, communism has fallen, decolonization has taken place, deep demographic and economic changes have taken place on all continents, and yet societies are still attached to the idea of sovereignty, territorial integrity, the integrity of borders, respect for human rights. What differs today from the past decades is the desire of some countries to undermine this order, to weaken the international order based on these universal principles. [[Look, Kaczyński.]] This challenge can be permanent if it does not meet the reaction of the international community. For Poland, for the whole of our region, severely affected by the ruthless twentieth century, respect by all, by all states, the values and fundamental principles of international law contained in the United Nations Charter is fundamental. For this reason, we will continue our efforts to ensure that as early as June 2017. Poland has been selected as a member of the UN Security Council, which is the only body of a global nature whose decisions are universally binding and the international community has the right and responsibility to respond to the protection of world peace and security. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, In recent years, we have seen once again that defence of principles and values can only be effective if supported by force, not only by moral force, but also by military force, by force of alliances. This is our safety umbrella. We\'re strengthening its construction to withstand the worst rains. Therefore, as in the past year, security policy will be a top priority of Polish foreign policy. We are concerned about the aggressive policies of the Russian Federation in Eastern Europe. In Ukraine, the war conflict has already been fueled by Ukraine for the third year. It is a conflict that involves two of our neighbours, creating for Poland a number of real challenges and threats. Russia\'s expectations were particularly high in October 2016. On the occasion of Russia\'s decision to withdraw from the US platoon disposal agreement, we could learn about Russia\'s ambitions for Eastern and Central Europe, such as the actual withdrawal of NATO from the whole region, transforming a dozen countries inhabited by tens of millions of people into a grey zone doomed to instability and uncertainty. Poland will not accept such a vision of political order in Europe, it will not agree to divide our continent into zones of influence. No more Munich and Yalta. [[Applause]] Russian political action is accompanied by concrete military action. We are concerned about the expansion of the Western Military District, which has been enriched by three new divisions in 2016. Further militarisation of the royal circuit is underway, including the deployment of new weapons. medium-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear charges. The clear task of Polish foreign policy under these conditions is to fully implement the decisions of the NATO summit in Warsaw, as well as previous agreements with Newport. This will be the centre of our interest and activity in 2017. In this respect, we are also preparing for the NATO Summit in Brussels this year. In practical terms, it is crucial to establish the advanced presence of the military Alliance in the East in the form of four battalion battle groups in Poland and in the Baltic States. These actions have already begun. The US armed forces are becoming an increasingly important security factor for Central Europe. In 2017, we will maintain efforts to increase their presence in Poland. They will include the construction of an anti-missile base in Redzików, the organization of exercises involving an armored brigade, which is coming to Poland as well as sub-groups of American air forces stationed in Łask and Powid. British soldiers will be welcomed to our country in April this year. In a situation of direct threat to an armed incident in our country, even a dozen thousand soldiers of allies may appear as a result of recent decisions. We think about the security of the Republic of Poland and Europe in transatlantic terms. For us, strengthening the cooperation of Americans and Europeans in the field of security remains a priority. Political leadership and military engagement of the United States is essential to preserve NATO\'s credibility and coherence. The moment after that is special due to changes in American politics. There have been a lot of misunderstandings and speculation in this context. There were voices of doubting the credibility of the United States as a pillar of the North Atlantic Alliance and a strategic ally of Poland. The Government of the Republic of Poland is paying close attention to the process of crystallising the foreign policy of the administration of President Donald Trump. After my recent discussions with his close advisors, I am convinced that the successful cooperation with the United States will continue. Cooperation with Canada will also continue. The commitment of this country to security in our region, the presence of Canadian soldiers on the eastern flank deserve our high recognition. The strength of the Alliance stems from unity and solidarity and from faithfulness to the values that unite our civilization. These qualities will be taken into consideration in the pursuit of the security of our ally territory and the stability of our neighbourhood. The most important instrument in this respect is cooperation with partner countries, among others. Ukraine, Georgia, Finland, Sweden. This year we will welcome you to the full members of the Montenegro Alliance. This is confirmed by NATO\'s continued readiness to join its group of countries which have a similar understanding of European security and share the same values. We hope this will not be the final stage of the Alliance\'s expansion. The consistent attitude of the Republic of Poland has made us perceived as a country interested not only in its own security, but also in the safety of others. Our allies see us as a member of the team game, which is to ensure the security of the entire region. In this spirit, we are working to strengthen the Eastern Alliance flank not only in the Baltic Sea region but also in the Black Sea basin. Regular consultation and consolidation of positions so called The nine of Bucharest already translate into a measurable strengthening of the security of our entire area between the Baltic, the Adriatic and the Black Sea. Our allied credibility is also determined by the development of national defence capabilities. Poland is a model for other Member States as a country that takes security seriously. With full responsibility we approach NATO\'s recommended ceiling for defence expenditure of 2% GDP with a minimum of 20% This expenditure shall be used for modernisation. Among allies, a similar approach should be a rule, not an exception. We want to maintain the effectiveness of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe - the OSCE. However, whether and to what extent this will happen depends on the goodwill of all participants in this dialogue. It doesn\'t always happen. I am thinking, above all, of the perverse approach of our largest eastern neighbour to peace and stability. However, I am convinced that the OSCE can serve as a platform for a return to a predictable, safe European security environment. Poland remains open to dialogue for this purpose. At this point, it is worth noting the discussions conducted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the OSCE on the status of this organisation in Poland. This is particularly important in connection with the location in Warsaw of the largest OSCE institution, i.e. Offices of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights - ODIHR. We hope to conclude negotiations on this issue in the first half of this year. High Izbo! Changes in the European security environment require new, far-sighted solutions. This is particularly true of the cooperation I have already mentioned between NATO and the European Union, which, based on the principles of complementarity, should focus on the development of civil-military capabilities. We will support maximum deepening of this cooperation, in particular as regards combating terrorism, hybrid threats, strengthening the resilience of partner countries, cybersecurity and joint exercises. This concept is also part of NATO\'s support for the Union\'s operations in the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea in connection with the migration crisis. The challenges of both the East and the South have contributed to deepening cooperation within the framework of the EU\'s common security and defence policy. Poland participates in actions to strengthen this policy, including: with regard to the proposed permanent planning and command structure of the European Union missions, strengthening military and civilian capabilities, and increasing the use of the Union\'s rapid response forces, i.e. European combat groups. Another step towards a common security and defence policy could be the creation of a European Border Guard. In response to this, negotiations were concluded at the end of January and an agreement was initialled on the status of Frontex and its staff. Warsaw is and will remain the seat of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Let us also remember that, in line with the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union has the possibility of permanent structural cooperation within the framework of the so-called. PESCO for the most demanding operations. For several years we have witnessed a dramatic situation south of Europe. The weakness of state institutions in some countries of North Africa and the Middle East creates a vacuum filled by non-state actors, including terrorist organisations aimed at destroying the Western world. Russian civil society\'s policy against the Syrian conflict raises concern. We remain more vigilant than ever before about the terrorist threat. Poland is not among the countries most at risk of attacks, but at the hands of Al-Qaeda and Daesh our citizens have been killed many times. Moreover, the attacks against Germany, France, Belgium, Turkey have hit our allies. Thus, they were also aimed at the Republic. We will not be safe both as a state and as citizens until we put an end to terror. Our response will be to continue our commitment to the anti-terrorist coalition. At the moment, several hundred soldiers, military workers, civilian experts are serving in the framework of the coalition in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, and the ship Kontradmiral Czernicki is carrying out tasks as part of the NATO mission in the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea. Poland will maintain its commitment to NATO and European Union operations. Our current participation in two NATO missions and ten EU missions is a valuable experience, but also a reason for deserved pride for our soldiers, military workers and civilian experts. We are also in the process of returning to the United Nations peacekeeping missions. High Seym! The most difficult challenge we will face in 2017 will be the future of the European Union, which is in an extremely difficult position. This was due to many reasons, but above all to the hasty, non-reality initiative, which was based on ideological motives and not on the welfare of the Union\'s societies. There is a gap between European elites and citizens losing the sense that they have a real impact on what is happening to their countries and the integration project. For this reason, societies issue negative censorships to their elites, for which this should be a call to restore relations with citizens, not to question these bad assessments. The lack of mechanisms to correct European policy in accordance with democratic principles has led to a situation where more and more Europeans are willing to question the European project in general. This is clearly seen in elections and referendums, as well as in public opinion polls. An unprecedented event and a turning point in the history of the Union has become the British referendum on membership of the European Union. It denied the general belief that the integration process was irreversible. At the same time, in many other Member States, eurosceptic voices, both on the right and on the left, which question the legitimacy of a united Europe have ceased to be a marginal phenomenon. I would like to say with emphasis here: the priority of our government\'s action is to fix the European Union and not to dismantle it. Returning to Europe of national selfishness would be as damaging as integration utopia not rooted in the social and political realities of our continent. The renovation of the European Union, which we are calling for, must not consist in renewing the facade and discussing decorative details, but in an in-depth assessment of the state of the foundations on which the whole construction of the European structure is based. We do not rule out that the foundation of four freedoms will have to build a new Union on the basis of a new European Treaty. [[Yeah, yeah, it\'s brand-new.]] [[How about on the new foundations right away?]] This year we will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaties of Rome, which have started today\'s European Union. This will be an opportunity to summarize the achievements, but also to reflect on the future of the integration project. In view of the scale of today\'s challenges, it is time to have a rational debate and seek common solutions. I believe that a new political compromise on the future of the Union is possible. Poland will co-create new solutions for both our national interests and the wider European interest. I believe that these efforts will be effective because I am a peer of the treaties and I would like to celebrate these two anniversaries in a good mood. [[You were born in Rome?]] [[Great Britain...]] It is in the interests of Poland and Europe that we have a strong and competitive Union, and we therefore want to strengthen the single market, which promotes the unity and cohesion of the European Union. We consider it a priority to make full use of this potential in the services and goods sector, to promote entrepreneurship and to improve the competitiveness of European industry. We oppose protectionist practices, creating new barriers, especially with regard to the freedom of movement of persons. Their manifestation is, among other things, one of them. changes to the Posting of Workers legislation and the lack of freedom to provide services that a united Europe started to implement in 1977, or 40 years ago. We want to adapt the Single Market to the challenges of the so-called. The fourth industrial revolution. The Union must become an area where, apart from the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital, the free movement of data will be ensured. This will open up new opportunities for entrepreneurs to develop. Poland will endeavour to ensure that the benefits of the digital single market are spread as evenly as possible throughout the European Union. 2017 will be important in view of the development of the multiannual financial framework after 2020. We will be actively involved in this process in order to safeguard our interests, including with regard to cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy. They have a very strong impact on the debate on the future of the European Union in the negotiations with the United Kingdom on the exit of this country from the European Union. We respect the democratic choice of British citizens. We believe that negotiations should be of a substantive, emotional nature and focus on future relations between the Union and the United Kingdom. We want them to be close, but based on the balance of rights and obligations. The result should not encourage further disintegration of the Union. It will be a priority for us to protect the rights acquired by Polish citizens living in the Islands. They should be guaranteed regardless of the length of stay in the United Kingdom. We will strive hard to take Polish interests into account also in the discussion on the shape of the European Union after Brexit. This should primarily be a discussion of the necessary changes in the practice of the European Union in response to the tensions in the European construction that have emerged in connection with the British referendum. We believe that it is also necessary to restore the central place of the Member States in the Union. EU action should focus on creating the basis for economic growth, citizens\' security and tackling migration challenges. Brexit will also be confronted with the challenges of the departure of one of the main net contributors to the budget, a country like us not belonging to the euro area. In the face of the migration crisis, we are convinced that the exit from the current problems should be sought not in the forced relocation of immigrants, not in the forced resettlement, but in the settlement of problems at their place of origin and in the more effective protection of the Union\'s external borders. The river of immigrants sailing to western Europe will not change its course as a result of EU directives. The idea of effective solidarity proposed by the Slovak Presidency gives the chance to build a broad agreement. Poland does not remain idle. In 2016, Polish border guards and policemen supported their colleagues in Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia and Hungary. Polish humanitarian aid also goes to migrants and refugees in Jordan and Lebanon. This year, we\'re going to increase this aid significantly. A separate issue is the recognition by some Western European politicians of the Polish contribution to managing the migratory pressure from the East. More than a million people, mostly citizens troubled by the war and economic crisis of Ukraine, reside and work in our country. This huge number shows that Poland\'s policy in this area is effective, although the goal is achieved in other ways. In this light, it is completely unjustified to attempt to force the consent to relocate refugees by threatening to reduce EU subsidies to Poland and other Central European countries. Energy policy will remain another important element of Polish engagement on European level. The strategic objective is, in particular, to open access to Norwegian gas deposits in the North Sea. In this context, we will implement investment projects to strengthen energy independence, especially the Baltic Pipe pipeline. The same is what we expect from the European Union, where the legal framework and projects must strengthen the security of supply of all Member States and not just the dominant supplier, as is the case with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Following the common good of all humanity, Poland, like 120 other countries, ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which should reduce the impact of climate anomalies on society\'s life, also on the conditions prevailing in our part of Europe. At the same time, however, we do not see any basis for the European Union to increase its ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Economic logic and the threat of a negative impact on the competitiveness of the European Union speak against speedy decisions. So we\'re going to try to get it. favorable for Poland legal solutions regarding previously agreed emission reduction targets. We will also seek to give Member States autonomy in shaping their own energy mix. High Izbo! The active European policy of Poland is also supported by bilateral relations with our partners, as well as regional cooperation. Last year there was an institutional strengthening of relations with Great Britain, which was expressed among others. implementation of the first Polish-British intergovernmental consultations. I know that sometimes there are skeptical voices, whether it is worth investing in relations with a country that is leaving the Union. That\'s a bad question. It is worth working with a nuclear state, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and still an active partner in European security policy. It is worth pursuing the interests of more than one million Poles living in the Poles\' Islands. The answer is therefore clear: such cooperation is in the strategic interest of the Republic of Poland. We hope that the United Kingdom will remain a close partner of Poland and the Union in actions to stabilise the international environment. We also hope to respect the rights acquired by Poles working and living in the UK, which the head of the Polish government has provided several times, also recently, in the conversation of Mrs Theresa May. We want to maintain close relations with Germany, our main partner in the European Union, a priority economic partner and an important ally within NATO. The measure of good quality of our relations in 2016 was the repeated meetings of politicians and the anniversary of the 25th anniversary. a treaty on good neighbourhood and friendly cooperation with the presidents of both our countries. This dialogue will be extended. At the same time we expect from the other side more openness, understanding for Polish reasons and our right to pursue Polish interests. Poland and Germany, working together and respecting each other, can do a lot of good for Europe\'s economic and political crisis. We do not forget the German Polonia. We will work to improve its situation, including to ensure adequate access to Polish language learning. We welcome the recent decisions of the Land of Hessen in this matter taken with commitment from our consular services and local Polonia. Poland is interested in best relations with France, based on strong foundations of common values and rich history. We have not only a common history, a love of democracy and a commitment to the European process, but also multi-billion-dollar economic, investment and traditional close contacts between societies. The future of bilateral relations should not be held hostage by a single commercial contract. In relations with both Paris and Berlin, we will propose further steps to make better use of the Weimar Triangle for concerted cooperation between our three countries. The comparison to three musketeers may seem too far gone, but the motto is one for one, all for... [[Voice from the room: One for one.]] ...one for all, all for one... [[Just a fork.]] ... un pour tous, tous pour un, would be perfect for our relationship. Without this cooperation, it is difficult to imagine the future of the European project, since Poland, Germany and France represent 1/3 of the territory of the European Union and more than 1/3 of its population. It also seems natural to engage the Weimar Triangle with the Visegrad Group, i.e. the tightness of such a political buckle of two parts of Europe. It is in our strategic interest that the Tri-Moor, a region located between the Baltic Sea, the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea, should reach the Western European level of civilization development and security comfort as soon as possible. As a result, we are developing different formats of regional cooperation: from the presidents of the 12 countries of the Tri-marine project, focused on the North-South infrastructure and energy security, through the dynamic Visegrad Group, focused on the needs of the nine eastern countries of the NATO Flank, the Bucharest Initiative, to the dialogue with a number of countries in the region using the V4+ formula. It is particularly important to stress here that regional initiatives supported by us they are not directed against anyone and anything, and they enrich and complement the sense of European integration. Ladies and gentlemen! We have recently passed halfway through our presidency in the Visegrad Group. The last months have confirmed the validity of the decision to revive this forum as the most important mechanism of Polish foreign policy in Central Europe. We believe that 2017 will be equally fruitful in this respect. Close ties with our neighbours help us to formulate a common position within the European Union, to build understanding and support for our demands in other European capitals. At the same time, while engaging in Central European cooperation, Poland has developed itself the position of spokesperson of the region in certain matters. Thanks to the revival of contacts with Nordic and Baltic countries, including the Polish presidency of the Baltic Sea Council in June 2016, we understand and know how to cooperate more effectively. The coming months should bring a series of my bilateral meetings with almost all Nordic and Baltic partners. We also want to work with the new Lithuanian government in good faith, although this depends to a large extent on the goodwill of our partners, especially in terms of the implementation of the rights of Poles in Lithuania. I talked about this with my Lithuanian counterpart during his recent visit to Poland. We have undertaken to test new forms of cooperation. Romania and Turkey are important economic and security partners in the region of the Balkans and the Black Sea and the Middle East. Cooperation with these countries has taken institutional form in the form of so-called. East flank triangle. We are paying attention to the developments in the latter country, which plays an extremely important role in the EU\'s plans to resolve the migration crisis. We trust that our Turkish allies will be able to maintain the right balance between respect for the rule of law and the need to stand firm against terrorism. Poland will remain an advocate of the enlargement process of the European Union. We believe that the doors of Europe should remain open to countries that share the vision of democratic cooperation between countries. We prefer to extend our hand in greetings rather than goodbyes, as is the case with the United Kingdom. We want to continue to share our accession experiences with the countries of the Western Balkans. This year we are planning a series of initiatives aimed at six candidate countries in the European Union from this region: Serbia, Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Kosovo. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, Poland is the only country in Europe bordering the three Eastern European countries and is necessarily more interested in the stability and peaceful development of this area than anyone else. We are safe in our Polish home, but like any good neighbour we cannot remain indifferent to what is happening behind the wall. And as a good neighbour, we believe that the basis for political order in Eastern Europe, as well as throughout Europe, can only be a sovereign choice of its own path of development by each society. [[Applause]] [[Bravo!]] We respect the individual choices of our partners - those who are in favour of closer relations with the European Union and those who are more suited to looser forms of cooperation. In this spirit, we support the idea of matching the Eastern Partnership\'s content to the individual needs of individual countries. The preparations for this year\'s Partnership Summit in Brussels should provide an opportunity for realistic evaluation and new impetus. Poland continues its policy of supporting the pro-European aspirations of Ukraine. We stand in the position that the basis for a peaceful resolution of the conflict is the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. The importance and importance of bilateral relations confirmed last year\'s visits by President Andrzej Duda in Kiev and President Petr Poroshenko in Warsaw. We support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities in the field of decentralisation, local government reform and the fight against corruption. 2016 was good for mutually beneficial Polish-Ukrainian defence cooperation. The Polish-Lithuanian-Ukrainian brigade took part in the exercises of Anakonda 2016. We started training Ukrainian soldiers on the Jaworów field, among others. with the United States and Canada. The Ministry of Defence of Poland and Ukraine signed two important agreements: a new general agreement on defence cooperation and detailed arrangements governing industrial cooperation. All this shows that the Polish-Ukrainian strategic partnership is increasingly filled with content and will promote building the resilience of our neighbour to destabilisation. We give Ukraine a clear signal that what happens today to their country is not only our concern, but also our concrete response. This is also more than 1,200 thousand. visas issued last year by our consular offices in Ukraine, including more than 650 thousand. Employee visas. Such action also responds to the needs of the Polish labour market, looking for workers in more and more sectors of the economy in Ukraine, and is a concrete example of foreign policy for the economic interests of the country. By supporting Ukraine in its reform efforts and pro-European policy, we do not lose sight of historical issues. We believe that the true strategic partnership should be accompanied by the truth. At the same time, we do not want our bilateral relations to become a hostage of the past. With it in mind, with a view to social dialogue, we decided to resume the proven format of bilateral cooperation, which is the Polish-Ukrainian Partnership Forum. We also strive to establish a Polish-Ukrainian centre of good neighbourhood, which would serve to bring Polish and Ukrainian nations closer together by developing good neighbourly relations, cooperation and cultural exchange. During the past year, Poland\'s policy towards Belarus changed. We have implemented a number of important visits and bilateral meetings, which have significantly broadened the horizon of our relations. The primary task will be to confirm the standardization of bilateral relations with specific decisions, mainly in the field of economic cooperation, border cooperation, trade, and also in the field of standardization of relations with Poles\' environments in Belarus. [[It\'s a great future.]] We are also preparing to launch the Polish-Belarusian historical commission. Unfortunately, policies towards the Russian Federation are conditioned by aggressive Russian actions in Eastern Europe. [[Where\'s the wreck?]] At the same time, however, we see the need for dialogue with our Russian neighbour. We will take steps to develop social dialogue, people-to-people contacts, cultural cooperation and the reconstruction of bilateral economic relations. We hope that the resumption of the work of the Polish-Russian Difficulty Group will contribute to this. We take Russia seriously, as the great country and neighbour are treated, but when it comes to our relationship, it takes two to tango. We will therefore continue to convince our Russian partners that constructive cooperation is possible if it is based on careful listening and understanding of the expectations of the other party. Here we expect to return the wreckage of the presidential aircraft TU-154 to the rightful owner, the Polish state. [[Something\'s not coming.]] The matter of recovering the wreckage lies at the heart of the government of Law and Justice, and especially the head of Polish diplomacy. I will not stop trying to do the will of Poles who have been waiting almost seven years for this to happen. We are currently considering the possibility of filing a complaint concerning the Russian investigation into the Smolensk disaster to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. We intend to make the most of the potential of relations with countries further east, with the countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia, especially in the field of trade and investment cooperation. It will help, among other things. our planned new Polish Institute in Tbilisi. High Izbo! One of the indicators of the international position of countries in the 21st century, in the 21st century, is their ability to cooperate effectively not only with the nearest geographical environment, but also on a global scale. Over the past year, we have put a lot of effort into developing relations with non-European partners. This will continue this year, taking into account the different dimensions of foreign policy. A lasting element of Polish foreign policy became a strategic partnership with the People\'s Republic of China. We use a favourable atmosphere in Polish-Chinese relations after last year\'s contacts at the highest level. We look forward to further developing cooperation in the 16+1 format, i.e. between the countries of Central Europe and China, including through the Secretariat for Foreign Affairs. Seaside located in our country. As the Chinese operative says, the journey for a thousand miles begins with the first step. We\'ve already taken a few steps. We also want to develop contacts with the other two strategic partners in Asia, Japan and the Republic of Korea. These are the largest Asian investors, thanks to which many jobs have been created and are constantly created in Poland. Dynamics is also gaining cooperation with India, as can be seen from the recent visit of Deputy Prime Minister Piotr Gliński in this country at the head of the business delegation and his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In line with the development of economic relations, we aim to strengthen the dialogue on global security issues, in particular as a result of the rise in terrorist threats. We attach key importance to cooperation with Japan, Australia, New Zealand. It will be served by my visit to these countries next month. Middle East, North Africa, Horn of Africa has been an inflammatory region on the map of the world for many years. At the same time, we see this area not only in the context of challenges but also opportunities, especially in terms of economic cooperation, as demonstrated by the increase in trade with countries such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. We have succeeded in strengthening energy security thanks to the beginning of summer days. (a) supplies of Qatari gas to a gas-port in Świnoujście. Oil tankers from Iran also arrived in Gdansk. Since the establishment of the current government, bilateral contacts with African and Middle East countries have been clearly intensified. We have re-established embassies in Senegal and Tanzania. The President of the Republic visited Jordan and hosted the king of Jordan in Warsaw, the presidents of Senegal, the Palestinian Authority, as well as the vice-president of Iran. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, a Polish-Israeli intergovernmental consultation took place in Jerusalem. As Minister of Foreign Affairs, I visited Israel and Palestine, attended the EU-League Ministerial Summit of Arab States in Cairo and the subsequent conferences on the Middle East peace process initiated by France. In 2017, I plan to visit a number of countries in the Middle East and Africa: Sudan, Egypt, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco and Mauritania. In response to the dramatic situation of the civilian population affected by the war in Syria, we have taken action to support people suffering, refugees and their communities in neighbouring countries. The priority is to provide assistance in Syria itself and in Lebanon and Jordan. We reach out to help those in need without media noise and political fireworks. At the initiative of Prime Minister Beata Szydło and Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2016, a joint 3-year reconstruction project was launched in Lebanon. Polish response to the humanitarian and immigration crisis is also a contribution to special EU funds. The total amount of aid in response to the Syrian conflict and the migration crisis amounted to more than PLN 119 million last year. [[Applause]] Poland strengthens political and economic relations with Latin America and the Caribbean region. He served it, among others. my participation in the October summit of the European Union Foreign Ministers and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States in the Dominican Republic. In the coming year, we want to give a strategic dimension to our partnership with Mexico... [[Overzealousness worse than fascism.]] ...why the planned visit of the President of the Republic in this country will serve. We will consistently step up cooperation also with other countries of the Pacific Alliance - Chile, Colombia and Peru. We will host the President of this last country in Poland this year. Initiatives undertaken worldwide by Polish diplomacy are accompanied by concern for the state of human rights. In 2016, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution proposed jointly by Poland, Australia, Chile, the Republic of Korea and South Africa on the role of good governance in promoting human rights. Poland seeks to ensure that the protection of the rights of religious minorities, including Christians, is of interest and joint action by the European Union and the UN. We are involved in drafting documents on freedom of religion and religion and are taking part in debates on this subject. Poland is one of the sponsors of the UN resolution on freedom of religion and religion. We draw attention to cases of non-compliance with the rights of religious minorities, including cases of persecution of Christians. During the December conference of the Warsaw Dialogue for Democracy organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, one of the sessions was devoted primarily to the protection of the rights of people belonging to religious minorities. In the international forum, we draw attention to the worrying situation of human rights in Crimea, including the situation of religious, ethnic minorities, especially the Crimean Tatars. Mr. Marshal! Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, Supporting Polish companies abroad is one of the priority tasks of Polish diplomacy. It serves this purpose, among others. development of the network of our diplomatic offices in the world. Our companies are increasingly prepared to face international competition, but diplomatic aid is often necessary for the new market. It is often the only weapon in cases of unfair and discriminatory practices. In 2017, we will focus on promoting Poland as a creative and innovative country. We will support Polish start-ups, establishing contacts on foreign markets. Our goal is also to activate cooperation between Polish and global scientific centres. I initiated such activities last year, visiting important business missions such as Seattle in the USA and Vancouver in Canada. As part of the economic promotion, we will pay great attention to green technologies, especially during the energy forum in Vienna and during the preparation of the COP24 climate conference in Poland in 2018. We are making efforts to increase the participation of Polish companies in tenders and projects of international organizations, which Poland is a member of. We are pleased that nearly 1500 Polish companies have participated in such initiatives in the last 2 years. We are increasingly committed to supporting the activities of international economic and territorial authorities. The support for Łódź\'s efforts to organise the Expo in 2022 will take a special place among these activities. High Izbo! Polonia and Poles living outside the country occupy a unique place in the foreign policy of the Republic of Poland. They are members of our Polish family, part of Poland in the farthest corners of the world. That is why we care more about relations with Polonia and Poles than others. Over the past year, we have put a lot of effort into pursuing the interests of Polish communities in various countries. In Latvia we prevented the liquidation of the Polish school in Krasław. In Germany, we negotiated the financing of the renovation of the Polish House in Bochum. [[Voice from the hall: What about Ukraine?]] After long negotiations, we have led to an agreement on cooperation in the field of education with Belarus. [[About the closure of Belsat.]] In response to the expectations of our fellow countrymen from the East, we amended the Polish Charter Act. [[Church of St. Mary Magdalene.]] We anticipate that the number of persons applying for this card will increase significantly in view of the new rights granted to card holders this year. Last year the consuls adopted a record number of over 27 thousand. conclusions. The government has also taken steps to speed up the process of repatriating Poles from the East. The largest group of repatriates, more than 150 people, arrived in December Ub. R. Kazakh. The new legal solutions significantly improve the aid provided to local residents from across the eastern border in Poland. We are ready to continue this work. The Polish authorities will continue to seek to respect the rights of Polish minorities in the East as well as their fellow countrymen in other regions of the world, especially recent migrants to Western European countries. The cases of aggression against Polish citizens meet and will meet with the determined and immediate response of authorities and consular services. Supporting the teaching of Polish language and knowledge about Poland will remain a priority task in the implementation of Polish policy. For support of Polish education abroad through institutions we intend to allocate much larger resources than before. We will place particular emphasis on the historical education of the young generation. The partnership also obliges in relations with Polonia. New initiatives are needed on both sides and a new look at the opportunities offered by cooperation and dialogue. In particular, we are looking for active involvement of our compatriots in actions for the positive image of Poland in the world. We are committed to effective and close cooperation between our institutions and Polonia, and we will therefore develop Polonia councils operating at diplomatic and consular offices. High Seym! Polish diplomats not only seek Polish interests, but also help citizens of the Republic under every latitude. They do so both when a person loses his passport and when he falls victim to a kidnapping. It is thanks to our diplomats abroad that Polish Poles can count on support in difficult situations. In order to provide effective assistance to citizens abroad, we are expanding the network of consular offices. We have established the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Houston, Texas, and we are planning to open the consular office in Belfast this year. In order to improve the telephone service of Polish citizens living in the United Kingdom and Ireland, we have established, already operational, a Consular Information Centre - a consular call center for Polish citizens. In parallel, we have launched an integrated on-call phone that facilitates efficient contact in crisis situations requiring contact with the consul outside the hours of work of consulates. Further, we envisage extending these services to other countries as well. One of the most serious problems our consuls face are matters concerning the parental power of Polish citizens. This is particularly true for countries that are aimed at intense migration - Great Britain, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Polish Consular Offices will do their utmost to ensure that parents receive proper assistance and support in such matters. The year 2017 will be the next year of active and multi-directional public diplomacy coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, diplomacy, which is the primary goal of taking care of Poland\'s good name and its image. This year we include the promotion of Polish political thought and history, Poland\'s contribution to the world heritage of humanism, the promotion of creative and innovative Poland. Like last year, we will pay much attention to the Polish historical narrative in the world. The main objective of our actions will be to present Poland as a modern country drawing from its tradition, as a tolerant state of many nations and cultures. [[Before your reign.]] We must also firmly, according to historical facts, preserve the good name of Poland and strive for its rightful place in the history of Europe and the world. We have activated actions aimed at combating lying statements of responsibility for the organization and functioning of Nazi German death camps during World War II. The deceiving of historical forgeries can serve modern forms of communication. For example, let the publication of the movie ""Words matter,"" meaning ""Words matter,"" by our embassy in Washington through social media, serve as an example. In 2017, the historical narrative will focus on the achievements of such outstanding figures as: Tadeusz Kościuszko, Józef Piłsudski or Józef Haller. In 2017, large international conferences will be held, co-organised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dedicated inter alia. the situation of European intellectual elites under German occupation and the Polish Righteous Saver of Jews. We will make extensive use of the various tools of public diplomacy, especially study visits with the participation of representatives of foreign opinion-makers. Mr. Marshal! Membership! Between 2008 and 2015 several dozen Polish diplomatic and consular posts were liquidated. In some parts of the world, especially in Africa, this has resulted in extensive white spots. This means not only diplomatic absence but also lack of consular assistance for citizens who are in need. Last year we reversed this trend. Gradually we recreate the network of Polish embassies and consulates. The embassies are already in service in Senegal and Iraq. In January this year embassies were established in Tanzania and Panama, and at the beginning of February the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in Houston. These facilities will start fully in the second half of this year. We are planning to establish a consular office in Belfast in the near future. Depending on the budgetary possibilities, we will consider opening the Embassy in the Philippines. If security conditions allow us to do so, we will resume the operation of institutions in high-risk countries, but important from the point of view of Polish foreign and economic policy, i.e. Syria and Libya. We are modernising many Polish foreign institutions as part of a comprehensive programme to correct long-term negligence in the proper maintenance of the infrastructure necessary for the functioning of the foreign service. This year we will start building embassies in Berlin and Minsk. 2017 will be the first full year of activity of the newly established Academy of Diplomat Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whose task is to educate young diplomats and professional development of the staff of the Ministry. Since the beginning of February this year. 32 people, selected in a multi-stage recruitment process announced publicly in the press, began a diplomatic and consulative application. They\'re twice as many applicants as they\'ve been trained in senior yearbooks. With a view to further professionalization of diplomatic personnel, we have started work on amending the Foreign Service Act. It is intended to help recruit for the service of high-class specialists, people dedicated to the mission of serving Poland and Poles. In 2016, we noted an increase in attacks, unfortunately, of ICTs aimed at the Ministry\'s critical infrastructure, also on 15 December 2016. We will continue preventive and reactive action to increase the ability of our diplomats to act without fear of the security of the information being sent. High Seym! The international order established after the Cold War is changing before our eyes. The international environment of the Republic of Poland is also changing. We view this as a difficult challenge to face. Polish diplomacy takes up this glove. Under these conditions, we will be guided by special responsibility and discretion, while at the same time taking forward-sighted action to make the Republic even safer and to make fuller use of its potential for development. Poland, a strong, growing, author-friendly country in the world, will be a credible ally within NATO, an important Central European country and a co-founding state of the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, today\'s concept of Polish diplomacy in 2017, subjective and civic, strongly embedded in multilateral cooperation and building valuable alliances, is the right answer to these problems that we have to face. This is the course we took. That\'s our new reality navigation. Before the debate, which, I hope, will begin soon, I will again appeal to Chinese wisdom: The man who says: This cannot be done should not interfere with the one who does it. [[Applause]] [[Bravo!]] I ask the High House to accept government information about the tasks of Polish foreign policy in 2017. Thank you so much for your attention. [[Applause]] [[Bravo!]] [[Some Members of the Parliamentary Club Law and Justice stand up, applause]]', 'Mr. President! Mrs. Marshal! High Izbo! Dear guests! Dear fellow countrymen! Just a year ago, he left for the eternal watch of Czesław Bridge called Wolf. He was born when Poland was not on the map. He grew up in the Second Republic of Poland. He was in an assist who carried the heart of Marshal Piłsudski to Vilnius. He took part in the defense of Warsaw. He fought in the Warsaw Uprising. In the Polish People\'s Republic he was imprisoned in the Katowina ubecka in Prague. He lived to see the Third Republic of He lived to see our time. In his person, the independent Republic bows down to all heroes today. Silent, nameless, persistent, faithful. All without whom the Polish way to independence, to modernity, to normality would remain only a dream. [[Applause]] The Poles entrusted Law and Justice with the task of building a Polish state of prosperity. Your safe and modern state. A country that everyone can proudly say: Poland is my home. They have entrusted us with this task in elections that have had the highest attendance for 30 years. We have received a strong democratic mandate from Poles, which results from a record number of votes cast on our group. [[Applause]] The results of the election showed that Poles return belief in the meaning of the promise, the meaning of politics. It\'s a big deal. Thank you for this trust, and I will ask the High House today after giving the exposé a vote of confidence in my government. [[Applause]] The Poles entrusted us with governance in unusual times. We\'re living in a breakthrough age. The world is moving forward at a rate we\'ve never seen in history. Old economic laws go back to the past, new laws just form. What will be Poland\'s place in a world that is currently undergoing the fourth industrial revolution? What position will our homeland take in the network of links, in a world based on knowledge and innovation? Will products and solutions reach every corner of the globe? How will our families find themselves in this world? Politics is a promise. A promise of a better future. We do not yet know what the world will look like in 5, 10 or 15 years, but we know that Poland is once again facing a historic challenge and a historic opportunity. It is up to us to decide whether Poland will be among the countries that will shape a new order or whether someone will determine it for us. Therefore, in the face of global challenges I count on extensive cooperation in the interests of Poland of all political forces - for Poland, for development, in the name of normality. [[Applause]] Our goal is a Polish state of prosperity. [[Applause]] Therefore, Poland cannot be the accident of our internal interests - only the sum of our common goals and ambitions. [[Applause]] Over the last 300 years of Polish history, we have faced great challenges: defend sovereignty, regain independence, maintain it and rebuild it after ruins, build modernity, build It\'s a normal country. There are few nations that have had the way to modernity as difficult as we have, but we have had our moments of history, which have only partially been used. This was undoubtedly the time of 1989. During these 30 years, much has been done. We managed to overcome many problems of the Polish People\'s Republic. That is why I thank you for the work of all governments, for the efforts of all ministers and prime ministers, including those who are here today in the Sejm. [[Applause]] But, of course, not everything worked out on this 30th anniversary. For years, law and justice have asked aloud: Were the decisions made at that time optimal? Have we taken all the chances in our best interests? Have we acted in the interests of society as much as possible? Was the Polish society the subject or the subject of transformation? The Poles chose Law and Justice for the second time, also because we find better answers to these questions than for 25 years. [[Applause]] And thanks to this we repair Polish cases as no one has ever done since 1989. [[Applause]] Piłsudski, using the phonograph for the first time, said he was standing in front of a bizarre trumpet. And although our times would seem even weirder to him, surely the principle which he had in his heart and in his head, like all the great Polish patriots, would not change, we must do everything that builds strong and normal Poland, we are Poles, so we must have Polish responsibilities. [[Applause]] And will micromania free energy for action? No, it won\'t. We need a brave Poland and a courageous vision of Poland. We must continue to work for our position in the global network of modern economies. The value of such an economy is talent, knowledge, innovation, regulation, efficiency and efficiency. We must also avoid traps. A free market in which fair competition rules are not established is rapidly distorted. The law of development is then subject to the law of force. And it is the role of the state to restore normality in this unjust imbalance. We see many manifestations of global injustice: the rise of social inequalities, the emergence of corporations so strong that they are able to circumvent the tax systems of countries in which they profit, tax havens that allow wealthy people to avoid paying taxes and ignore social solidarity, great tax carousels, money laundering. It\'s an anomaly, it\'s the harbinger of a future we don\'t want. Here\'s Banas. Today we caught the wind of history in the sails. Banasia. In recent years, we have just pierced the glass ceiling. The level of development of Poles\' income in relation to the world\'s most developed economies is highest than the beginning of transformation and at the same time the highest in Polish history. [[Applause]] Our main goal, the goal, is to build Poland as the best place to live in Europe, Poland daily normality, prosperity and peace on the streets and at its borders. It\'s a dream of millions of Poles. [[Applause]] If we consistently modernise our country, ensure fair access to the fruits of development, they sought an agreement over divisions, at least in matters such as security, energy strategy, pension system or demography, we have the best time for Poland. [[Applause]] We are already successfully fighting the inequalities that almost the whole West is facing. The indicator of social inequality, so-called ""social inequality"" Gini\'s indicator has fallen below 28 points since 2015. This means that in just four years we have managed to make the level of inequality the same as in Denmark and lower than on average in Europe. Lower than in France, Germany, Italy or the UK. [[Applause]] That\'s what brings down poverty. In three years, we have rescued about 2 million Poles from the threat of poverty. It is still not enough, but I am glad that so many Poles can look to the future without fear. That\'s not true. Many of us have in our biography the solidarity. But for us solidarity is not history, it is above all the purpose and principle of governance, the cornerstone of our policy. [[Applause]] Bravo! Solidarity is a government social programme which benefits all families. Younger children receive 500+, and the older ones who go to work are completely exempt from tax. Their parents have a reduced PIT, and their grandparents have a 13th pension. Development must be fair. [[Applause]] It\'s the basis of our social contract. But the contract starts to apply when a functioning state institution operates for everyone. That\'s why we invest in local and local roads. That\'s why we support families. That\'s why it\'s effective in Europe. That\'s why we\'re developing sports. That\'s why we\'re fighting for clean air. That is why we are here, and that is why we are building Poland so that as Poles we can feel here naturally, safely, normally, as at home. [[Applause]] Bravo! The last years are a period of positive economic achievements, a good time for Poland. The World Bank appreciates the new Polish development model, the new structural policy and the new industrial policy. The IMF is moving us up closer and closer to the first 20. The German press draws attention to the Polish economic miracle, and global agencies maintain a high rating and praise for macroeconomic stability for Poland. [[Applause]] The OECD predicts that Poland will be the fastest growing economy among 36 Member States in 2019 and 2020. [[Applause]] May I? Yes, you can. Recent years have also been a breakthrough in innovation. In 2018, R &amp; D expenditure increased by almost 25% compared to the previous year and amounted to more than 1.2% GDP. It\'s the biggest growth, in quota and percentage terms, in the last 20 years. [[Applause]] This record growth is a symbol of the great Polish creative power that sleeps deeply in Poland and in Poles. According to the IMF, almost 20 million people moved from Central Europe to rich, European, Western countries in 1990. This trend accelerated after the entry of our countries into the Union. According to the Fund, this change caused the countries of Central Europe, including Poland, to lose their income. Our income per head is at least 5% lower as a result of this migration. It is a great tribute which Poland has paid to the wealthy countries of the West. Such a tribute from the poor to the rich is not normal. The state of high standards must stop this. [[Applause]] But 2018 was the first year in which there was a significant reduction in the number of compatriots on emigration. About 100,000 returned to Poland. persons. [[Applause]] Bravo! Poles in the country are finally unpacking their bags, not packing their bags. High Izbo! I would like to see a great demographic strategy set up in the forthcoming term of office. We could be a much bigger nation in 20 years. Right. Demographic strategy and strategy of great return, return of Poles to their homeland. All of them. Those dramatically experienced in earlier generations, those from the East and those from the West. They will enrich Poland. We are on the brink of great changes and many negative trends. Despite this, my government\'s objective in the next 4 years is to maintain a high growth rate of GDP, at least by 2 and 3 percentage points higher than in the euro area. This will bring us closer and closer to the standard of living of Western European countries every year. [[Applause]] Recently, thanks to the effective foreign policy of President Andrzej Duda and the Polish government, we have been given the opportunity to travel to the United States without visas. [[Exhibitions in the O.R.]] This is a symbolic moment for our entire society, confirming that we are a full member of Western civilization sharing common values. This is the normality that finally came back to us. [[Applause]] The future is a modern Polish state of prosperity. The Polish state of prosperity is a country of families and a country of entrepreneurs, a country for the weak and strong - a normal state. This country, which respects the values of Poles, accepts no extremes, accepts neither utopian ideologies, nor worldview revolutions, nor chauvinism. [[Applause]] We walk with the spirit of time, but first of all we walk with the spirit of Poland... [[Applause]] Bravo! ... Polish equality and freedom, Polish normality, not Polish extremes. [[Applause]] We want to create the conditions for the middle class to grow, wide and equal to the European class, as has been the case in recent years, but we want more than just the promotion of individuals. We want the promotion of the entire Polish community. We don\'t want to be a rich country of poor people or a poor country of rich people. We want to be a rich community. [[Applause]] Norwid said that everything takes its power from ideals. Therefore, we do not accept such a reason that the main value is the lack of value, that freedom is freedom, that power is for power, that law can act without justice. After all, the Republic is the common good of all citizens. That\'s what art says. 1 the Constitution, and the programme of the Government of Law and Justice are based on values such as freedom, justice, democracy, respect for property and social dialogue. Our program is based on a culture that builds national identity, family and marriage subject to special protection, on the values enshrined in the Constitution. [[Applause]] We believe in these values and our beloved homeland we will inform where it belongs. Where? Poles are a great nation, with a great past. It\'s time for the big future. [[Applause]] Bravo! First of all, High Izbo, I\'m going to talk more about Polish families, about demography. The word given to Poles is sacred to us. We\'ve proven that for the last four years. That\'s why we\'re fulfilling all our iron commitments. The timetable\'s already set. For starters, development. We\'ll start with changes that support entrepreneurs. Lower ZUS, on average 500 PLN, for small companies, lump sum up to 1 million and then 2 million EUR of turnover, lower CIT to 2 million EUR of turnover or more than a billion for additional strategic investments for companies. This is a total of several billion PLN for small and medium-sized Polish companies. [[Applause]] But there is no healthy development without solidarity. So we do not forget the pensioners, the seniors, the weaker, the disabled. We will continue to pay the 13th pension and in 2021 - the 14th pension. We also want to take care of senior activity and ease loneliness It\'s the autumn of life. That is why we are expanding senior homes so strongly and encourage local governments to use government money for this purpose. The family is and must remain the foundation of society. [[Applause]] I know that today some people treat their family like they\'re lost. The louder we talk about new family models, the more sure it is about minority experiments and minority experimental solutions. We do not agree that exceptions determine what is the norm. [[Applause]] We believe that the future of our children should be built on a stable foundation of the family. When a man comes into the world, his family becomes his first bastion. But family is not just a bastion of every Pole. The family, as Primate Stefan Wyszyński said, is also a bastion of the whole of Poland. [[Applause]] There\'s a lot of talk in the West about women\'s unseen work. Work in the household is often more than one job. And there are ideas in the West that since women work so hard for families, it\'s probably the family\'s fault and it needs to be disassembled. Instead, we strengthen the family and appreciate the work of women. [[Applause]] Bravo, Matthew. Bravo! We\'re not in the West? We were the first to undertake a program of huge family-friendly social transfers. We were the first to respond specifically to the problem of unpaid work of women who raised at least four children. In Poland, the gender pay gap is lower than the average in European countries. But equality in the workplace is a value that we will strive hard for, because if for the same work our mothers, sisters, wives, daughters get a lower salary than men, it is not normal. [[Applause]] We will strive for a fair principle: the same pay for the same work. Polish women often face a choice: either a job or a child. The modern state helps with this choice. Therefore, next to the ever increasing availability of daycare facilities, the number of places in daycare has doubled for 4 years. We increase the availability of flexible forms of employment for parents through remote work or part-time work. Together with modern economy, new opportunities and new opportunities open up for Poles. After maternity leave, Mom must have a greater ease in returning to the labour market. Our actions will serve this purpose. [[Applause]] What have you done so far? Every parent knows that family is a big undertaking. Work, school, health center or training - you have to get there on time wherever you want, reconciling the responsibility of parents with the needs of children. Any large family can count on state support, support that has not yet been available, and for families with three or more children we will offer additional reliefs and facilitations. [[Applause]] Various family support and protection programmes will be at the heart of my government\'s policy, not only in the name of tradition and identity, but also in the name of the future, freedom and normality. [[Applause]] Where somebody tries to play freedom against tradition, we will stand up for the reconciliation of these two values. We do not agree to social experiments and ideological revolutions. The future of our children is at stake, and this future should be in the hands of parents, because this is normal. [[Applause]] And let me tell you more: children are untouchable. Whoever raises his hand, this ideological hand, raises his hand to the whole community. [[Applause, excitement in the courtroom]] Bravo! Bravo, Matthew! [[Some Members stand up, long-term applause]] Thank you. Who wants to poison children with ideology, separate from their parents, who wants to break up family ties, who wants to enter schools without invitation and write ideological textbooks, who puts explosives under Poland, he wants to start a cultural war in Poland. There\'s not gonna be a war. That\'s right! I won\'t let her in. [[Applause]] Bravo! And if there\'s anybody who\'s gonna cause it, we\'re gonna win it. It will be won by the family because the family is an archbishop\'s value. [[Applause]] Amen. What does it look like, High Izbo, in 2019 Poland? Just ask the Poles. 89% Poles and Poles are of the opinion that Poland is a country where you live safely. This is an increase of almost 20%, 20 percentage points compared to 2014. In addition, 98% of us claim that the nearest neighborhood, village, street, neighborhood or neighborhood is a safe place to live. [[Applause]] Poles finally feel in their neighborhood and in the country normal and safest in history. [[Applause]] In Konin. Konin is an example. Poles also look to the future more calmly. Other studies show that belief that the situation in the country is going in the right direction has increased: from 16% - a few years ago to 51% - in September 2019. It\'s more than three jumps. [[Applause]] Poland is a safe country today, but there is still one exception. It\'s road safety. Our roads are marked by crosses, which mean fatal road accidents and tragedies of thousands of families. Road safety will be one of our priorities. [[Applause]] We will create a safe road infrastructure program to co-finance safe walkways, street lamps, pedestrian crossings, roundabouts, lights, islets or elevates on crossings. Macierevich likes it. It can no longer be so that the pedestrian crossing is the most dangerous element on the roads. Studies show that pedestrians are mostly discreet in their transitions. That\'s why we\'re gonna put the pedestrians ahead of the crossing. There was a project! And who blocked it? It can\'t be that the courts blame an older, almost 80-year-old lady with limited mobility for trespassing. [[Applause]] It\'s the chopstick. It can\'t be like this. Today we all pay dearly for road pirates, in the worst cases - health or life, in the best cases - higher rates of OC insurance. We will introduce solutions that will make it road pirates to bear the financial consequences of breaking the rules. We will also involve citizens through the Internet and mechanisms for direct democracy in creating rules that strengthen the safety of road users. The biggest enemy of road safety is alcohol. The social permission to drive after consumption is over, but we still hear about the tragedies caused by drunk drivers. We will tighten the policy of punishing drunk drivers, but it is better to prevent than to punish. We will therefore strengthen prevention for those at risk of this terrible disease, including through appropriate regulation and price policy, in order to reduce the risk of alcoholism. [[Touchdown, applause]] Fame, it\'s about you. 100% The excise is up. At the same time, we will facilitate the movement of drivers with families in cities. We will introduce the possibility of using a buspas when there are at least four people in the car. Buspas performs its function when unloading traffic, not when it remains empty. [[Applause]] High Izbo! We extend the way to development to Poles, we extend the way to Polish freedom. Today Poland, even against the background of Europe, is a country of freedom. Even Members could sing songs from this speaker, although these were not very serious practices. [[Applause]] However, if someone wants to diminish this freedom, in the name of political correctness, restrict freedom of speech, art, freedom of expression, freedom of research, freedom of universities, then I say here: firmly no. We will introduce solutions that will guarantee such freedom, without epithets, without insulting one another, but also without embarrassing political correctness. [[Applause]] This freedom, this freedom also applies to entrepreneurs. Nobody can, for example. force the printer to print posters that are at odds with its value. [[Applause]] We are a nation of tolerance. Yes. But above all, we are a nation of freedom. Polishness is freedom. Polishness is solidarity. Polity is normal. [[Applause]] Bravo! Now I will talk about the quality of public services and institutions of the Polish state. Banana\'s here. When we talk about a country of prosperity, we often hear only: prosperity, and we forget that it is not just about the financial success of individual citizens. In the desert without other people, money has no value. It is therefore about the effectiveness of the whole state. Without the state, there will be no equal access to all modern services. The state must be in the game where the market doesn\'t do it. It\'s normal, but it\'s not easy. In addition, neoliberalism caused conceptual confusion and a mess in the value system. A lot of people believed false stories that the state was a liability. This disease, fortunately, is slowly leaving. No extreme is good. Franc loans... We\'re building a normal country. A country that gives freedom to create, develop, work, but also creates and improves boundaries within which every human being, every company can develop, flourish, fulfill ambitions and dreams. A normal country is an ambitious country. [[Applause]] In such normality it is worth investing, because the future of Poland depends on it. That is why we invest in those who carry Poland further: in students, in teachers, in education. Only this year did we increase the education subsidy for local governments by more than PLN 3.8 billion. How much is this amount? Suffice it to say that our predecessors have increased this grant by about PLN 3.5 billion over 4 years, so less than we have been able to guarantee for just one year. And also from next year, from the new school year, we will be spending money for teachers to raise salaries, as for the entire budgetary sphere. [[Applause]] For minimum wage. Modern school is an investment in the young generation, in the future of Poland. Therefore, we will launch a national and EU programme worth PLN 2 billion, which will make the Polish school fit not only the needs of the present, but also the future. These are aids for programming sciences or multimedia boards. It is also a support that will help to complete the necessary modernizations or simply improve the quality of the rooms where our children and young people learn. [[Applause]] During our term of office, we will carry out a great modernisation of schools. Our goal: at least 1000 zero-emission, energy-efficient, green schools. [[Applause]] We\'ve significantly reduced the number of pages, according to Grant Thornton, but we want to move on. We will propose the creation of a parliamentary team which, in agreement with the government, will identify and propose changes: a common deregulation package and a freedom package for citizens and business. Already today I invite the opposition, employees and entrepreneurs, entities of the third sector, think tank to work together in substance. Cooperation over divisions for the common good, for the sake of a good, strong Republic is also a beautiful manifestation of normality. [[Applause]] This process of in-depth dialogue with citizens is very important to us. Citizens\' budgets in many of our small homelands already show the activity of Poles. For this I would like to thank all citizens, as well as the local governments, who organize this activity efficiently. We also want to build a citizen-friendly country. Better country every day. And a better country is also a better justice system. We will continue to reform this area. We\'re gonna cut back on time. So far. Isn\'t that what the vast majority of Poles want? [[Applause]] Our citizens have the right to get the courts started at last. normal functioning. That\'s the standard all over the world. Then don\'t bother. Independence is very important, but it doesn\'t mean irresponsible. [[Applause]] It\'s about the division of the authorities, but it\'s also about their balance. The democratically elected parliament has an impact on the cast of courts in each country: in the United States, in France, in Spain, everywhere. For example, in Germany, an active CDU politician was elected Vice President of the Federal Constitutional Tribunal a year ago. [[Applause]] Exactly. He didn\'t have a CEO over him. Does the opposition in these countries go to international institutions complaining that there is no rule of law there? [[Applause]] No, because they understand that it\'s bad for their countries. I would very much wish that Poland would be normal in this respect, as it is in mature countries of the West. Peterovich. Let us not weaken Poland, complaining about it, but strengthen Poland together. [[Applause]] Let us consider how many Poles today would assess the functioning of offices for the highest possible assessment. How many would determine the satisfaction of how to handle their case as 10 out of 10. I don\'t know, but it\'s not enough. We will introduce mechanisms to check the satisfaction of the citizen from contact with the office. We can do a lot of official business today only in our place of residence. We\'re gonna change that. That\'s changing now. Offices are made for people, not people for offices. [[Applause]] In the age of the Internet, the administrative boundaries of offices are no longer an excuse. We\'re gonna change that. We will implement public services in many areas. Various certificates or urgent charges - we will make sure that such matters can be handled not only in one specific office, but in any facility, both at home and at the other end of Poland. [[Applause]] Digitization will help us do that. We have great and good experiences here. We have already succeeded in what has been the government\'s Achilles\' heel for many years: health care IT, e-recipes, e-releases, online patient account, benefit from the benefits of the digital economy. It\'s a 4.0 revolution in practice, for the benefit of the citizens. And not virtual hospital debts. Effects? Every day we issue about a million e-recipes and electronic layoffs. In this and other areas our slogan is: from paper to digital Poland. [[Applause]] Bravo. It\'s about health care. Two years ago, when my government was formed, I said that oncology and cardiology would be a priority. Cancer and heart disease are a huge threat to all of us. These are some of the biggest Polish health problems. It\'s happening today. The national cardiac health programme is effective, e.g. reduced mortality and minor complications in patients after a heart attack. We\'ve developed a strategic approach to oncology. The National Oncology Strategy has begun to improve prevention, early detection, diagnostics and treatment of cancers. We have introduced the National Oncology Network to ensure that every patient, regardless of his or her place of residence, is included in an effective treatment programme. We have included a refund of hundreds of modern medicines, for which patients have been waiting for years before, and since 1 October 2019 also the breast cancer unit - a new model of organizational care for women with breast cancer. We\'ve radically increased our health efforts. They increased from PLN 70 billion to PLN 106 billion - by more than 50%. [[Applause]] Bravo, bravo! We will also introduce the announced research package for each Pole after 40 years of age and allocate almost a billion zlotys to the state-of-the-art oncology center. Thanks to our actions, already during this term of office, the medical course will end by up to 50%. more students than four or five years ago. After all, we will not solve the health problems of Poles without doctors. In the Polish health service there are already many modern facilities, equipped with world-class devices. Unfortunately, this is not the case everywhere. To raise standards in large cities, in small districts, we will create a Hospital Modernization Fund. This is an improvement in comfort for patients whose mental and physical comfort should be double important for us. Renewed, modernized hospitals will be a symbolic farewell to the PRL\'s charity and scratching in as important a field as health. [[Applause]] Bravo! Therefore, we will invest in health, but we will also invest in a culture of physical activity, as well as in a well spent time. We will take care of the development of amateur sport, support with specific money sports clubs throughout Poland, wherever people want to train together, develop their skills, but also just spend time together. We\'ve invested $6,000 in four years. sports facilities and in the next 4 years we are ready for even more. [[Applause]] Here I have some knowledge, because I consulted directly with the Minister of Sport. [[Joy in the O.R., applause.]] Sports, amateur and professional sports will be an important priority for the government. Let the European Games in Krakow be an example in 2023. It\'s another big party in Poland. Sports enjoy everyone, after all, the promotion of our team to Euro 2020 is a joy for every Pole. Congratulations to Polish footballers. [[Joy in the O.R., applause.]] Thanks, Matthew. Bravo, Minister! Matthew\'s been running to the gate lately. The government is a tool for citizens to build their own country. These tools must be efficient, so we will make a fundamental review of state institutions, cutting red tape, administration, and thus save at least a few billion zlotys. That\'s why from the beginning of our governments we\'ve been betting on efficient institutions fighting tax fraud, effective services... [[Exhibitions in the O.R.]] Yes, sir. Banana\'s here. ...effective special services and efficient development institutions, like the Polish Development Fund, which other countries of the region want to learn from us. [[Applause]] Bravo! In order to achieve all these ambitious social and development plans, we must rely on a modern economy. The modern economy needs to rely more and more on professionals, more and more earning workers. The model of development based on the belief that Poland is supposed to deliver cheap labour, was like a vicious wheel, like a car parked in front of a horse. In this way it is difficult for the Polish economy to go far. It fit the others, but it cut the branch below us, which is why we\'re done with it. The heart of modern economy is entrepreneurship, the responsibility of the state is to support entrepreneurs, create conditions for development, a predictable law allowing investment planning and a tax system that motivates development. Therefore, the PiS government reduces taxes for entrepreneurs (Movement in the Chamber), we support and support Polish companies, because supporting their companies is an absolute norm, is a normality. Foreign companies are big, strong and already supported by their countries. We have been told that capital has no nationality, but it is nonsense. The first term of office was aimed at tax sealing. We will not stop these efforts, but at the same time decisively, pointlessly and systematically simplify tax law and introduce further solutions supporting Polish companies, small and medium-sized enterprises. Today there are already half as many tax checks as in the days of our predecessors. During this term of office, we will propose a further overhaul of the tax system so that further benefits can be enjoyed by the widest possible number of Poles. We will introduce further investment incentives for the smallest entrepreneurs, e.g. the possibility of immediate settlement of investment costs in fixed assets, without the need for long-term and depreciation formalities. [[Applause]] But not at Sławek Nowak\'s. We\'ll introduce the so-called. Estonian CIT for micro- and small companies, i.e. the transfer of tax collection at the moment of profit distribution by the company. It supports the reinvestment of profits and facilitates own financing for small companies that need a capital injection very much. [[Applause]] Bravo! But we will also be one of the most friendly countries for foreign investors. Just read the Global Best to Invest report, where Poland is in fifth place in the world, after China, Germany, Great Britain or India. We will cooperate with such investors, but without sale of Polish family silvers. We will also continue to support the international expansion of Polish companies. As in the first term, we will recolonize on market conditions, because the more Polish companies, the more freedom and prosperity, the more normal. [[Applause]] The fourth industrial revolution, big date, artificial intelligence, learning machines, 3D printers, cybersecurity, data clouds - either we\'re going to be active participants in this revolution, or we\'re going to be pushed to the side of history. We are an ambitious nation and we want to get into the mainstream of the world\'s economic change. Finally, after hundreds of years, this is the most important task for us: let us open Poland the door to modernity, to the future. [[Applause]] We want to promote creativity and innovation. Poland becomes technology. It\'s in our DNA. Pride extends our breasts, as we can see that Polish students in team programming are in the most accurate world front. Polish students must be ready to meet new requirements. The school has a great duty to prepare them for this. The race continues over time, so we will adapt the programme of science and vocational education to the requirements of modern economies. Poland is a great project. Entrepreneurs and employees need not be and should not be on two sides of the barricade. In mature countries, agreement is normal. We will be patiently discussing state-employer-worker issues within the Social Dialogue Council so that healthy compromises build strong growth. Just like tonight. Projects imposing new obligations will be treated in a special way. We want the principle to be simple - one new regulation removes another. [[Applause]] We will also promote employee shares. Let us also ask whether it is normal for subsidies for Polish farmers to be lower than subsidies for French or German farmers in the next budgetary perspective. No. We have convinced Europe of our solutions on the issue of migrants, we have convinced the Polish Commissioner for Agriculture and we will convince Europe of good solutions for villages at European level. [[Applause]] Bravo! These solutions must be as good as possible for the Polish countryside, for small, medium and larger farms. Poland is a huge value for Polish culture, for Polish nature, Polish economy and Polish society. [[Applause]] Yes, High Izbo, you cannot overestimate the role of the state in the economy, but underestimating it is the same sin. We will break for good with the curse of temporary - temporary solutions, temporary projects. It is normal for us that Poland has regained its ability to take long-term perspectives. But in order for us to develop for the next 10, 20, 30 years, we need to think in this perspective. That is why we will continue the challenges and plans we have set ourselves in the Responsible Development Strategy, because we want Poland to avoid medium-development traps and to become a member of the developed countries of the world. I want to make it clear that Poland can and will be Poland\'s big projects, projects that will mean a real civilization leap of our country... I don\'t believe it. ... projects that will make Poland one of Central Europe\'s key transport and energy centres. Strategic investments of the Polish state will also be a cushion of security against today\'s forecasts in the world economy. High Izbo! Yes, Poland of big projects is also normal. Normality in the case of a brave state and an ambitious society. Insanity is the defensive voices saying that if there is something in Berlin, then why do we need it in Warsaw. [[Applause]] The state can\'t just be a night watchman, and it\'s sleepy on duty. You can\'t abdicate. [[Applause]] Nice. Therefore, over the next 4 and 6 years, in line with the Responsible Development Plan, we will invest tens of billions of PLN in the largest Polish projects that will strengthen our community inside and outside our position. That\'s, among other things. excavation of Vistula mine, tunnel to Świnoujście, construction of Central Communication Port, Via Baltica, Via Carpatia, construction of more than one hundred bypasses, repair of hundreds of stations, hospitals, schools. It is a huge programme of modernization and expansion of railway connections, powerful investments in renewable and conventional energy or finally construction of Baltic Pipe - a new gas supply corridor, which will at the same time be the symbolic end of Poland\'s dependence on gas supplies from the East. [[Applause]] This is certainly expected by Poles normality in energy security of Poland. What about carbon? As for the groundbreaking nature of the Local Roads Fund programme - we have already said a lot. It\'s called Schletinski. If anyone has any doubts, talk in their districts and municipalities. This program will continue. But I also mentioned railroads. Our goal is to modernise and build more than 9 thousand. km of railroad tracks. Such length of tracks could be covered by the Polish border almost three times. We\'re gonna wrap it up. It is a total of several hundred places in Poland: Polish villages, Polish towns and cities, which will be included in the timetable of the PKP. It is a huge number of newly built platforms and stations and rebuilt stations, which after 1989 fell into ruins. It\'s a normal thing to do. And activation of LOT. It is everyday convenience for people and fair development in practice. Prosperity also depends on good infrastructure, and good infrastructure depends on how we use public capital in the development service. The state of prosperity is an equation to which a factor in the form of strong, independent Polish capital is necessary. The main feature of the development of the Third Republic of Poland from a macroeconomic point of view can be defined as this: to a large extent it was consumption on credit. The future must be based on savings-based investments as well as on consumption, but based on increasingly better earnings and own investments. Therefore, one of the best information that came to me this year is the data of the CSO, which shows that for the first time in the years of the Third Polish Republic there were more Poles who could save some money than those who could save nothing. [[Applause]] The saving revolution takes place in Poland without much noise. Still, it deserves to be called a historical moment. It\'s happening right in front of us. The failed experiment, which was OFE, wasn\'t normal. To borrow it to put it in a deposit. Does anyone do that? Today we give Poles a choice. We\'re stealing - 15%. . In our project, everyone can receive money from the OFE, which will become private retirement funds. [[Applause]] But you can also assign your contribution to your ZUS account. We have done this because we believe that partnership and freedom of decision give rise to trust, and there is no pension system without trust. We\'ve done a lot more than that. We\'ve put in place the first groundbreaking private savings program. Private savings, which is the basis of healthy liberalism and capitalism, the basis of a healthy economy, as already argued by Mill, Spencer or Weber. This program is PPK - employee capital plans: benefit for future pensioners, motivated employees, motivated employers and stable program of saving funds, formation of long-term Polish capital, epoch change. Our program is a program initiated by the government, but the savings that Poles collect thanks to it are fully private and inherited funds. But at the same time we understand Poles\' distrust of the system. It didn\'t come out of nowhere. That\'s why I have a proposition for everyone sitting here in the gym: Let\'s fix it together. Let\'s change the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. [[Touchdown, applause]] Oh! Shame, really. Let us change the Constitution of the Republic of Poland so as to guarantee the means of PPK and individual pension accounts, guarantee their privacy and protection. [[Applause]] This is how we can regain the trust of our citizens, restore their faith in a worthy existence. Bravo! At the same time, my government will continue to manage the state\'s finances responsibly. We\'ll build stable public finances. We\'re going to build finance that will give us prospects for development. It took four years, four good years to have such concepts as declining public debt, tax sealing or a balanced budget in the Polish dictionary. [[Applause]] Bravo! Now our approach to energy and climate. For the first time in history, we are able to reconcile the three main principles of our energy policy: energy security, price competitiveness and environmental care. And coal. Traditional energy will still be important in our electricity system for a long time, but reality is changing. Once we couldn\'t afford to develop renewables, and now we can\'t afford not to develop them... Then who destroyed them? ...also because it can give a powerful boost to development for the Polish industry. Prosumer energy, photovoltaics, a programme for the construction of offshore farms, electromobility, as well as nuclear power plants - it is not only an energy programme, it is also an economic programme. Polish shipbuilding, metal, steel industry, precision mechanics, Polish seaports - they will all benefit from such investments. To make full use of this huge potential, which can be compared with the largest pre-war development programmes, we will establish in the government a proxy for renewable energy sources. We\'re already generating a dozen times more electricity from solar energy than we did a few years ago. The total power is 1.5 GW. There\'s 100,000 behind this data. Prosumers that make our energy green. Solar collectors are increasingly powering both blocks from large plates as well as rural houses. But responsible thinking about the environment must also fight to ensure that plastic does not flood our planet. We will introduce a deposit system for disposable plastic bottles and a number of programs to reduce plastic consumption. [[Applause]] In many areas, we are even more ecological than we seem. About 3 million Poles drive cars for gas. We\'re developing an electromobility program. It\'s a process that needs support. We will therefore propose further reliefs for those who use environmentally friendly means of transport. Clean transport is supposed to be good for nature and good for our wallets. At the same time, we consider it a mistake when from Poland and the Union, as a result of climate regulation, jobs flee to neighbouring countries. The carbon footprint, tax regulation and prevention of carbon leakage must support Polish energy and Polish transformation. Nor do we accept discrimination and disregard our starting point. We need to have some power supplies. The most expensive is the electricity not delivered. It\'s a big problem for our factories, our homes and our hospitals. Our pro-climate transformation must be safe and beneficial for Poland. [[Applause]] Poles have the right to allow their children to breathe clean air. It\'s normal, it\'s not ideology, it\'s a public good that doesn\'t know political divisions. We will therefore continue to develop the Clean Air programme intensively. This is not a matter of the right or left. We have implemented new regulations in housing construction. Between 2011 and 2014, an average of 143 thousand were put into service. apartments. Between 2017 and 2020 this will be over 200,000. apartments. [[Applause]] Our National Housing Program, part of which is What? Where? We have transformed the right to use perpetual land under residential buildings, this relic of the Polish People\'s Republic into a normal property right. [[Applause]] Bravo! We all know that Poland has a wonderful history, but we do not believe in a wonderful future. Great civilization projects will create such a future. Finally, Poland\'s development is catching up with our imagination. Now with Poland\'s position in the region and Europe. Oh! We take responsibility for Poland, but we are also ready to take responsibility for our region, for Central Europe and for the European Union. [[Applause]] 30 years ago, it seemed that the fall of the Iron Curtain led to the establishment of a global order. Today, unfortunately, we see that the world has become rather a space of new disorder. There have been new threats, such as global terrorism or waves of immigration. New ones, such as corporations whose budgets often exceed the GDP of medium-sized countries, have joined traditional actors on the global stage. We entered the European Union in a club of equals, not in a school with a class of students and a teacher\'s room. It\'s a bad model, even if we\'re supposed to be top of the class. As Lech Kaczyński said: we are looking for a partnership Europe in which our country belongs the place resulting from its size and history. There is nothing more normal than fighting for your own interests in the European Union. Everyone does that, it\'s standard. [[Applause]] Bravo! We have a plan for the Union. A plan that can be expressed in a few simple points. First of all, solidarity and subsidiarity. We want to reduce centralisation and Brussels bureaucracy. We want to restore solidarity and subsidiarity, in accordance with Article. 5 of the Treaty on the Union, but also with a preamble and an article. Two of our constitutions. Second, fair taxes. We will strive for a fair and effective tax system. For years, large international corporations have avoided paying taxes, various accounting tricks have made profits. It\'s not normal. The world\'s largest and richest companies have to pay taxes where they profit. [[Applause]] We changed this part in Poland, we will change it in Europe. A few years ago, we started to say out loud that we had to end tax havens, that we had to fight the VAT mobs. Today, the whole of Europe repeats this and uses our experience. [[Applause]] A friend\'s sitting there. I\'m going to repeat how Katon talks about Carthage: tax havens must disappear, they must be closed. It\'s no paradise, it\'s a nightmare for ordinary people, for families and countries. It is not normal that the Union, our European Union, loses EUR 150 billion a year in CIT, the size of the annual budget, and does not see this elephant in peace. [[Applause]] Nice. And the second elephant in the form of €155 billion VAT loss. Oh, I think we could use a little more law and justice in the Union. [[Joy in the O.R., applause.]] Third, fair competition. We will not agree to discrimination against Polish entrepreneurs. We want to finish building the common market. Over the last 15 years, Polish entrepreneurs have conquered EU markets by hitting them. It\'s time to make all the difficulties go away. And that\'s what we\'re going to fight for in Brussels with all our might. The dominant position of many corporations in certain sectors distorts competition. The concentration of resources in the hands of the strongest players is a disorder of normal, healthy market development. The Polish UOKiK will strongly counter the dominance of various industries by stronger ones. [[Applause]] Fourthly, the fight for Treaty freedom to provide services. Fighting absurdities such as the need to return 200,000. Polish TIRs, Polish trucks to the base - resulting in pollution of the environment - only to reduce the competitiveness of hard-working Polish drivers and Polish entrepreneurs. [[Applause]] Fifthly, the European Union\'s ambitious budget with new own revenues, with an extensive agricultural policy and the construction of road, rail or environmental infrastructure. Strengthening the Cohesion Friends Group, the 16 EU countries with similar objectives, will help us to fight this ambitious budget. Sixthly, the partnership of the West. We will defend the Alliance of Europe and the United States. Just as the European Union is the guarantor of continental order, NATO takes care of global order. Poland is and must remain an integral part of both of these organisms. [[Applause]] The irresponsible swinging of our European ship, the extremes of isolationism, the disintegration of the Union, but also the federalization of the Union, we strongly reject as harmful and dangerous. [[Applause]] NATO is the most powerful military alliance in the history of the world, and that\'s because its goal is to preserve peace. The voices of some leaders questioning the article. 5th Washington Treaty or failure to fulfil allies\' obligations, i.e. 2% GDP in defence, weakening our security, threatening the future of the Union and NATO. We\'re going to counter it. [[Applause]] Europe needs to return to its roots, to its values, to its founding idea, to its Christian values. We no longer live in a time of safe Western domination. In the Far East, the Middle East and for us the nearest East are international players who are willing to benefit from Europe\'s weaknesses. That is why we want an ambitious European Union open to the adoption of new members open to the Western Balkans. If we do not present a real offer to neighbouring countries, others will present it: Russia, China, Turkey, radical Islam. It\'s already happening. We want a Union that works closely with the UK after Brexita, the active Union and has global aspirations. This vision requires efficiency: efficiency of the Polish economy, efficiency of Polish diplomacy, efficiency of Polish science, strength of Polish values. It\'s obvious. But all of this together isn\'t enough. There is still a need for cooperation. Today, the Visegrad Group has become an important pole of Europe, a pole of political reason and values, an oasis of peace and normality. Together, we are seeking a good EU budget. Together, we prevented thousands of refugees from coming from the Middle East. [[Applause]] Together, we stopped bad personal decisions. This is largely due to our activity. This cooperation for the benefit of Europe will be deepened and developed, as will the tedious efforts to develop the Tri-marine, a new strategic dimension of the transatlantic community. (Applause) Bravo! The United States, our most powerful ally, has made a decision, thanks to the efforts of President Andrzej Duda and the Minister of National Defence, to increase the U.S. military contingent in Poland more than ten times. Although the world is not a safe place today, Poland becomes safer by day. [[Applause]] A great friend of Poland and one of the world\'s greatest leaders finally said: Poland is neither in the east nor in the west. Poland is at the heart of European civilization and has greatly contributed to the development of this civilization. [[Applause]] The center of the world. Yeah, it\'s not just rhetoric. Poland has a chance, we have a great chance, like the Lorenzo Teisseyre zone, to connect the West to the East, the North to the South of Europe. Here, with us, the best features of European heritage, European values can find their future. This combination is our goal. [[Applause]] Finally, a few sentences about the pride of belonging to the national community and about Polish culture. Generations of Poles grew up on the Lantern of Sienkiewicz, a novel about the bitter fate of the emigrant and love for his homeland. The constant flow of blood, migratory waves, one after the other, is the drama of Poland. Today the Poles return to their homeland again. Finally, today Poland for generations of migrants can be a hope and a future, a place of return. [[Applause]] Pride. And how can Poland be seen from the outside today? We could ask each of the 20 million tourists who will visit Poland this year. It\'s a record that shows how powerful our homeland is. They see what we forget too often. Poland is a beautiful, interesting, rich country. A country we can be proud of. We also want to attract our fellow countrymen from all over the world. To this end, Polish summer schools for children and young people will be established, so that the next generations of Poles born abroad will be able to ask where Poland lies, not only to indicate the place on the map, but to make Poland lie in their hearts and in their plans. [[Applause]] Bravo! My sleep. Father Kornel Morawiecki emphasized that Poles have a work of great pride. There was no war coming out of our homeland, we were not the perpetrators of anyone\'s destruction. On the contrary, how few of us were defenders of freedom. Poland is today facing a great opportunity to build its good future, a future good for itself and for others. [[Applause]] Pride. In today\'s world, these communities, these countries, are best able to reach consensus on key issues. We need to find out, not beat. We don\'t have to agree on everything. Let\'s start by agreeing on some of the most important things. Lech Kaczyński said that Poland needs wine settlement, but Poland needs consent even more. [[Applause]] Bravo! That is why we are open to cooperation, which is why in many matters of health care Prof. Marian Zembala advises us, which is why Marek Balicki is the government\'s attorney for psychiatry reform today. After all, this is not a parliament of five electoral committees. This is not a parliament of 560 parliamentarians, but a parliament of all of us, of the whole nation. [[Applause]] And although each of us looks at Poland from a different perspective, although we look at Poland from different perspectives, we still see the same horizon. You know what I see on this horizon? The future generations of Poles grateful that in 2019 their ancestors came off the path of even deeper division, that they chose to agree on the fundamental interests of our country. Ask Macierewicza about it. That\'s what I want, and that\'s what I\'m asking. [[Applause]] Mr. President! Mrs. Marshal! High Izbo! Dear fellow countrymen! I believe in our own path. I believe in values that didn\'t die with our ancestors, but lasted for generations. I believe in Polish independence and stubbornness, which gave so many great scientists and explorers, so many silent heroes. I believe in Polish imagination and Polish sensitivity, which expressed themselves in the indestructible works of art and works of the human spirit. I believe in Polish entrepreneurship and Polish talents that overcome all adversities. I believe in the potential of our country, which has not been fully exploited in the last three decades. And I believe more than ever that the moment has come to turn this potential into reality. [[Applause]] We can be the strongest generation Poland had. We can be a generation that will see Poland great and free... I think we could use some specifics. ...like in the dreams of our fathers, happy and wise as in the prayers of our mothers and grandmothers. This ambition is older than our divisions. It\'s bigger than them. It\'s the ambition that all Poles carry. We must have perseverance and, above all, faith in ourselves. It is precisely because of perseverance and faith in ourselves that we are here where we are. Dear fellow countrymen! We all carry a spiritual heritage whose name is Poland. Let us follow the advice of Andrzej Trzebiński, our war poet: let us not pretend that Poland is somewhere else, that it is something else. It\'s where our ancestors left it to us, and it will go where our efforts will bring it. What kind of Poland will we give to our successors? The time has come to decide. Size is a matter of choice. We are going to the new one and may God watch over our way. Thank you very much. [[Some Members get up, long, turbulent applause]] [[Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki receives a bundle of flowers]] Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, Prime Minister! Some Members chant: Matthew! Matthew! Matthew!']","<|system|>

For the first time since the beginning of the 1990s, Koronapandemia has led to a decline in human development. The pandemic has widened the gap between prosperous countries and poor developing countries. In this context, strengthening and targeting development cooperation, especially for the weakest, is particularly important. Mr President! The central starting point for Finland’s development cooperation is to support developing countries to achieve sustainable development goals. The starting point is always to strengthen the capacity and carrying capacity of developing countries. By combining public and private funding, overall funding for sustainable development can multiply and generate wider development impacts. Finland is committed to the UN target of spending 0.7% of its gross national income on development cooperation, and the target year for this is 2030. Although this report does not yet contain a roadmap for development funding for that objective, it is important that it is pursued with determination, as Mr Skinner has said here. On the positive side, Finland is very close to achieving the 0.2% target for the least developed countries. The emphasis on development funding for the poorest and most fragile countries must continue. Mr President! The report outlines the long-term priorities of Finland's development policy, such as women's and girls' rights, education, democratic societies and climate and natural resources. It is important that education is given a new focus. The content of the training focus remains relatively thin in the report, but the first steps in the implementation have been good. The new priority will be systematically deepened and its links with other priorities and humanitarian aid will be strengthened during the Government term. Finland’s geographical focus of development cooperation is Africa, a continent of young people, where around 60% of the population are under 25 years of age. After the economic crisis caused by interest, it is all the more important for young people to receive training that leads to employment and livelihood. In African countries, between 10 and 12 million young people enter the labour market each year, but only 3 million new jobs are created. From this point of view, it is important that the report takes a broad view of the role played by the private sector in the development process. Small and medium-sized enterprises are particularly important for the creation of new jobs. However, it is in the least developed countries that the SME sector is underdeveloped. Finland therefore has the opportunity to be larger in size in support of the responsible and growing SME sector in the least developed countries. Mr President! Development cooperation in the midst of the climate crisis and the loss of nature is more important than ever. Development policy also implements the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Climate change, natural disasters and increased natural disasters make the achievement of sustainable development objectives more difficult and more destabilising. They increase refugees, migration, poverty and conflict. Food security and access to water and energy are also at risk. However, developing countries can play a key role in the international solution by implementing sustainable development and by choosing climate-resistant, biodiversity-friendly and low-emission solutions in response to development challenges. Finland must also play its fair role in supporting climate action in developing countries. However, the increase in climate finance must not reduce other development funds. Emissions auction revenues should be allocated to development and climate finance in the future. Finland must promote the identification of climate refugees in international agreements. Mr President! Finland's development policy must be genuinely human rights-based, transparent, effective and responsible. Greens are in favour of reporting development results in accordance with internationally accepted open standards. Companies supported by development cooperation funds must be obliged to comply with the best possible criteria for tax liability and transparency and to contribute to the objectives of Finland's development policy. It is also necessary to ensure that Finland’s foreign and trade policy consistently supports development policy objectives."", 'Mr President! I am very proud of the fact that Finland has confirmed, at the top of the UN Member States, that it is embarking on the Agenda for Sustainable Development and the implementation of its objectives. The goals will lead to a more stable, prosperous and equal Finland and the world. Today\'s Government report is also the first of its kind internationally. Finland, which is carbon neutral and equal, presents how we implement the objectives of sustainable development in concrete terms. Now we\'re gonna take a really big leap. For its part, Finland makes a record of sustainable development, as it has been able to combine Finland\'s efforts to promote sustainable development, both national and international, in the same programme, even over the parliamentary term. It is noteworthy that NGOs selected Finland as the best reporting agent of the UN last year. The action programme has two priorities and three cross-cutting policy principles. In all of these, Finland\'s activities outside its own borders have also been taken into account. This is very important, for never before has mankind been equally dependent on one another and on diminishing resources. The effects of our own actions also extend far beyond the borders of our country and, of course, far-reaching events affect us: let us think of the refugee crisis in Europe and our borders caused by violent crises and wars. That is why it is important, among other things, that Finland is committed to helping achieve the SDGs in other parts of the world. Mr President! The first priority of the report, \'Hilineutral and resource-wise Finland\', starts with the idea that we need concerted action to keep the development of the world\'s population and the growth of material consumption within the limits of the carrying capacity of nature. Finland should produce well-being in an environmentally sustainable and fair way. Thus, in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement, Finland supports developing countries in their climate action and promotes carbon neutrality and resource wisdom in developing countries. In our own country, an important priority is to accelerate sustainable public procurement in municipalities and government. In Jyväskylä and For example, a biogas system has been created in Vaasa where buses pass through the area with biogas produced from waste. In Helsinki, buses are moving from Neste waste to renewable diesel and electric buses. The strong focus of the circular economy is reflected in numerous applications across Finland. It is also very important to involve private financial flows in the fight against climate change. In Finland\'s development cooperation, for example, some 60 per cent of Finnfund\'s funding is directed towards climate projects. Finland also supports developing countries to make use of green value chains and environmental technology solutions. Finland can play an important role in supporting efforts to combat and adapt to climate change in the world. This is particularly important in the poorest countries most affected by climate change. The second priority of the report, ""Finland is equal, equal and knowledgeable"", states that everyone is a valuable and equal member of society and that everyone should have equal opportunities for well-being, good life, health, work and functional capacity, education and employment. Children and young people, their well-being and gender equality are particularly important target groups, which is also a strong point in Finland\'s report on foreign and security policy and development policy. Mr President! Gender inequality is one of the main problems in developing countries and strengthening the role of women and girls contributes to all other development objectives. In support of UN organisations, for example, Finland has clearly prioritised UN Women, UNFPA and activities that support equality, women\'s and girls\' education, inclusion and sexual health and family planning. More generally, Finland will also strengthen equality by supporting human rights and equal societies, and will invest in the development of ways of assessing human rights, strengthening the states of justice, democracy and good governance. Finland supports decent work, inclusive growth, equality in working life, equal pay for the sexes and job creation throughout the world. Mr President! The report also discusses the key policy principles of implementation and their relationship with the global partnership. Decisions taken in different policy areas have a significant impact on the achievement of sustainable development objectives in Finland and globally.', ""Mr President! We all recognize that we live in the midst of powerful changes. The world around us has changed quickly and irreversibly. The aim of foreign and security policy is to safeguard Finland's independence, strengthen our international position, guarantee the safety and well-being of Finns and ensure the functioning of society. Finland promotes international stability, peace, democracy, human rights, the rule of law and equality. The main objective is to prevent military conflict. These objectives and objectives serve as a guiding principle for the government in all situations. The Government's line is Finland's long line and the same as when the Government Programme is being implemented. Finland is a non-military country that implements practical partnerships with NATO and maintains the possibility of applying for NATO membership. Mr President! One of the key events since the completion of the Foreign and Security Policy Report has been the presidential elections in the United States. The new US administration is just about to settle down, and the rest of the world has been waiting for their policies, but not all the questions have been clarified. President Trump's visit to Europe last week left a lot of questions rather than answers. The Administration of President Trump has previously confirmed the United States' commitment to European security, but this was not heard from Trump himself at the NATO meeting last week. Obviously, failure to say so left a feeling of uncertainty, and this weekend, Chancellor Merkel of Germany honestly described his feelings. However, a direct statement should not be overdramatised. The fact that European NATO countries should do more for European security has long been the view of the United States. It has also been an organization’s own goal. However, there is no major change or change in the US foreign and security policy in the big picture. Finland is particularly interested in US policies on trade policy and climate issues. We still have to wait for trade policy policies, but the new positioning of the United States in climate policy is worrying. It would be in the interests of Finland, Europe and the world to keep the United States committed to the Paris climate agreement. In this respect, development cannot be changed by blinding. Mr President! The security situation in Europe has not changed substantially since last summer. The situation in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine has not changed for the better. The formula would be clear — implementation of the Minsk Treaty and respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine — but we have not seen any progress. That is why the EU's sanctions policy will continue. At the same time, bilateral dialogue with Russia is essential. No one beats not talking about problems. The direction of Turkey has raised many questions. It is equally clear that Turkey is of great importance to Europe. This has been seen very concretely in cooperation on migration, among other things. Turkey's European orientation is particularly important to us and must also be reflected in respect for European commitments. The rule of law is a key cornerstone of European order and there are no exceptions to it – otherwise there will be no exceptions within the EU. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, it was said that Europe was surrounded by a circle of stability. Not anymore. The Syrian war continues for seven years. The activities of the terrorist organisation Isil overshadowed the whole region and are increasingly reflected in the internal security of European countries. Further participation of Finland International cooperation against Isil will be discussed in this Chamber later today. Cooperation between the EU and NATO has received a good start from the Joint Declaration of Organisations last July. We have ourselves supported the deepening of this cooperation in a very concrete way through the establishment of a hybrid competence centre in Finland linking the EU and NATO countries. EU membership is a key security policy solution for Finland. Its significance is only emphasised when we live in uncertain times. The Parliament was very clear about the EU security guarantees less than ten years ago. Mr President! Issues related to sustainable development, the environment and climate are global issues of destiny and therefore also cross-cutting themes in Finland's foreign policy. We can take them from a very specific point of view now that we have received the Presidency of the Arctic Council. Arctic issues are also part of our EU policy and also have a strong interface with Nordic cooperation. Cooperation between Finland and Sweden has also progressed well over the past year. We are in close contact at different levels, both at political level and at civil service level. Defence cooperation has progressed as planned. Together, we have achieved a special status as NATO partners, and we are involved in the discussions of the organisation on the Baltic Sea region. A good example of this is Finland's initiative to improve air safety in the Baltic Sea, which has also contributed to the dialogue between NATO and Russia. Mr President! Membership of the European Union was once a political choice for Finland, by which we were increasingly committed to the Western community of values. The main task of the European Union is to ensure peace, security, prosperity and the rule of law on our continent. The need to carry out these basic tasks has not gone anywhere. The difference between Britain and the EU affects Finland in many ways. In preparation for the negotiations on the divorce agreement, Finland has advocated a line that would safeguard our interests and at the same time protect the Union. We welcome the unity with which the EU27 countries have made progress in their preparations. There are no winners in this process. Britain has been and will continue to be an important partner for Finland. Only later will we see the negative economic, political or security effects that Brexit will have on Finland. In the aftermath of the British referendum last June, we launched a political reflection by the Heads of State on the development of the EU-27. It was completed in March in Rome by a declaration on the future of the EU. The Rome Declaration is in line with the objectives we have pursued and promoted at the meetings of the Heads of State and Government at national level. Five discussion papers published by the Commission on the social dimension, the management of globalisation, EMU, defence and financial frameworks are also linked to the EU's debate on the future. In the debate on the future of the EU, the main focus is now on concrete development projects. In line with the Rome Declaration, the focus is on four main areas: economic growth, social issues, security and global challenges. A few words about the four development projects mentioned above: First, the economy. A strong internal market and free trade are key instruments for promoting growth. Finland is actively working to secure the conditions for free trade at European and global level. The functioning of the internal market requires continuous work, inter alia, to make full use of digital opportunities. There is also much to do and much to gain in the internal energy market. Influencing climate and energy policy is timely and important. It is in Finland’s interest that we are a pioneer in these matters. In this context, the sustainable use of forests must not be hampered by theoretical accounting rules in the land use sector. The starting point is that the difference in Britain is fully taken into account in the overall level of the financial framework. It is essential for us that the financial framework continues to support economic growth, employment and knowledge. Regional and structural policy must take into account Finland's remoteness and sparsely populated areas. Agriculture must be able to operate in a profitable way in all the Member States of the Union. At the same time, responding to migration and strengthening defence cooperation are new issues where EU funding is needed. Mr President! Economic and monetary union has been developed in many ways in recent years as a result of the financial crisis and the debt crisis. Member States must comply with the agreed rules and implement their own structural reforms to balance public finances. At present, it is a priority to finalise the work, particularly with regard to the Banking Union, and to implement the reforms. Finland is not in favour of greater solidarity, nor is it in favour of more risk sharing in the banking sector. Investor responsibility must also be maintained. Another development is the social dimension. We need to be able to create a fairer and more equal Europe, for example by improving the position of women and creating models for reconciling work and family life. Strengthening the social dimension of the EU does not require new instruments or processes at EU level. Furthermore, Finland does not accept the creation of transfer mechanisms between EU countries. The third element relates to security — both internal and external. In order to combat cross-border threats to internal security, in particular terrorism, we need to step up cooperation, improve the exchange of information and find new means. Defence cooperation is a good example of an issue whose promotion brings added value but which does not require Treaty changes. All the conditions are already in place, including, where appropriate, different pace. Deepening European defence cooperation is a natural development. Europe must be more able to manage its security and defence together and contribute to the stabilisation of its neighbourhood. Each Member State must shoulder its own responsibilities. Finland is strongly involved in this work. The aim is to agree on closer cooperation on resources between willing and capable Member States through so-called permanent structured cooperation, to examine the development of national defence capabilities in a coherent way, to set up a dedicated military staff for training operations — in this way as a first step — and to improve the EU's ability to act in crisis management. As regards permanent structured cooperation, Finland has put forward concrete project proposals such as space cooperation projects, marine defence, logistics forces and the improvement of the EU's cyber defence capability. We will explore opportunities for cooperation with potential partners and continue national mapping. On cyber security, for example, I have spoken to several colleagues. Mr President! The fourth theme is global challenges. Globalisation and in particular digitalisation change the economic environment and the conditions for growth also outside traditional foreign trade sectors. Globalisation will not only increase competition but will fundamentally shape international markets, business structures, operating models and the conditions for value creation. In the EU, we must be able to take advantage of these opportunities of globalisation to defend our values, interests and interests, and to achieve sustainable growth and employment. Managing and responding to migration is a global problem. As far as migration is concerned, it is both a matter of dealing with the acute situation within the EU and of creating more permanent solutions. We need to be able to influence the root causes of migration more effectively, develop border security and require proportionate involvement of all Member States in burden sharing. Mr President! Finland needs to prepare for the EU reform to take off, perhaps now, but it will. We are actively involved in this work. Under the Government Programme, the Union needs to be reformed and improved, but the government does not consider it timely to amend the Treaties. The starting point for the EU's reflection on the future has been that Treaty changes are not discussed in this context. The conditions for more efficient operations have existed without a process that lasts for years, even a decade. For example, we could already make wider use of qualified majority voting. The European Union must, above all, develop unity in the elections. If necessary, however, progress can also be made at different paces within the Union. Even in those situations, the provisions of the Treaties must be respected and the doors opened to all Member States and at all stages of development must be kept open. Finland participates in all relevant EU projects where this is justified by the interests and influence of our country. Consideration is always made on a case-by-case basis, and so far Finland has been involved in all of these. The Union must focus on the essentials, implement its decisions and dismantle red tape. The European Union must be large and small in small matters. Mr President! One of the stages of history is under way. Typical of these transitions is that many international rules of the game do not work or are not respected. Moreover, the stages of transition will not last forever, but will inevitably end in establishing common rules or building a new one. This is why we must never give up hope at the turning point in history. Finland is not a bystander in this transition phase either, but an active influencer. It is important that, with an active foreign and security policy, we play our part in building a more stable, secure and fairer world.""]","<|system|>

After the management of events in the past few days, seeing that the conflict between Catalonia and the State has reached a certain limit, I thought it necessary to make a specific statement. One. A political conflict with a high social root must have an interview for political solution. The composition, the judicial method, and the means of punishment are by no means remedy. Two. From the point of view of the extreme conflict we must take to the circle of political and institutional dialogue. You need to get him off the blind street to the interview table. Three. From the point of view of political responsibility, it is a fundamental challenge to avoid social or political rupture, both internal and different areas of land and organization. From the point of view of democracy it is a political matter of offering occasion to the right of society and of the people, by the way of consent, to receive them. Four. The departure is to confess the conflict between the wills of the majority of society in Catalonia, in Eucharin, and in the Spanish State, which, as far as the national project is concerned, appear far from each other. Five. It is a democratic choice between the wishes of the Spaniards, the Catalurians, and the majority of the euscal communities to open a political process. The Spanish Government ought to give way to the negotiation of political solutions. The will to the conversation is expressed by very tender gestures. As tender as opening the door of the interview, always with the will. I have always maintained a position of prudence and respect for the path and decisions that Catalan society and institutions have taken. I have defended dialogue and political negotiation as the most appropriate way to find a solution. I have pointed to the Scottish model, to the United Kingdom model, as a reference to combine the principle of legality with the democratic principle. Following the events of the past few days, the way in which the conflict is managed has gone beyond some limits that require an express pronouncement: One. A political conflict with high social roots requires a negotiated political solution. Neither the imposition nor the judicial process, let alone the criminal procedure, is the solution. Two. The conflict over Catalonia must be transferred from a framework of agonistic confrontation to a framework of political and institutional dialogue. It is necessary to take him from the dead end to the dialogue table. Three. The fundamental challenge, from the point of view of political responsibility, is to avoid any form of social or political fracture, whether internal or between different territorial or institutional spheres. From a democratic point of view, responsibility is to articulate consensual mechanisms so that societies and peoples can express their will about their future. Four. The starting point is the recognition of the existence of a conflict between majority social wills, which in terms of their national project are manifested in divergent forms in Catalonia, in Euskadi and in the rest of the Spanish State. Five. I propose to promote a process of political and institutional dialogue that will enable the majority aspirations of Spanish, Catalan and Basque societies to be reconciled democratically. The Spanish Government should open the door to a negotiated political solution. The will to dialogue is demonstrated by very simple gestures, as simple as opening the door to dialogue with the will of understanding and agreement. Not a year ago, September 25th of September 2016, a political diversity and diversity of euphoria in the elections of the Errical Autonomy. He\'s made his government an interview and an agreement from conviction or need. It\'s not a new thing; for it\'s been built in decades by Euskade, by institutions, political parties, and by participation in society. That\'s our town model. We live a very special moment, and three principles of principle: We must show that we are capable of realism, stability, and agreement. Social realism to show we have feet on the floor. Realism means the knowledge of the problems and necessities of the Basque people in their daily life. Political stability, economic growth, and employment. Organizational consent, cooperation, and concentration to maintain the direction of our decisions. From this point of view I shall proceed to this first discussion of this legislature, considering the international environment and the Basque situation. Your whole speech will be at your disposal. Today I will present a summary. First of all, the international environment view. The economic crisis has conditioned the political, economic and social life of the last decade. We\'re in a new growth cycle now. However, I\'m convinced that we\'re going to work all over the decade, if we\'re going to survive the crisis. I\'ll quote four items of the international agenda: Number one. The next two years will be essential to Europe\'s future after the brexit negotiations. Europe has to design its future, and, as I advanced to President Jean-Claude Junker and other European authorities, we\'ll take part in that process. Our wager is to increase political and social Europe in addition to economic. Number two. The new President of the United States has brought a change to the economic policy and foreign policy of the United States. I shall remark a fundamental question: The COP21 agreement on climate change has been suspended. In our politics, however, we will diminish our fluids and bet on the environmental fancillation. Third. We\'re worried about the world\'s safety, the tensions rise and international terrorism. The United Nations Organization must assume the leadership to overcome this situation. Fourth. Europe has a serious humanitarian crisis, because the refugees are escaping from war and from poverty. Our commitment is to receive refusions, to agree with humanistic values and solidaritys. We have a clear attitude to these subjects, always in the sphere of the European Union. And so I informed the chairman of the board and other authorities during the meeting in March. Then I\'ll show you the views on the Basque Department of 2017. I\'ll start by mentioning the phenomenon. The financial and social situation has improved; the last year\'s effort helps us to look into the future with a more powerful attitude. We have been hard years, hard years for the whole society, hard years for family and corporations, even for the institutions. This year the growth has been stabled and step by step maintains the employment agency. I\'m a realist, we need to create more employment, better quality. I\'m a realist, this crisis has left us some permanent differences and poverty bags and we have to keep facing them. I\'m a realist, I\'m aware that companies are trying to adapt themselves to them and try to create new possibilities. We know there are difficulties. I\'m sure the funk will continue to pay attention to the special situation of corporations with difficulty. The crisis has revealed the responsibilities position, the position of solidarity, and the ability to start with the changes necessary to guarantee the future. In order to face the profound crisis that we have lived, society has shown a definite determination, unity, and efficiency. We know all the limitations and difficulties, but he\'s getting out of the crisis with political, economic, and more social stability. Based on all this, we\'re at the time of a new speed. Time to invest in the future. To invest the economic and industrial transformation of the Basques in the development of subordinates and the digitalization of society. It\'s time for a new political press. The reality of Catalonia is near, it seems to me a serious mistake that it did not reach the conflict in the state\'s territory, the transformation of its model. It cannot be understood that the slowness of the state, the ""gent"" of politics, is the best, the lack of political enterprises. There\'s always time to talk, and there\'s always time for interviews. It must be necessary that the state should change its attitude by the roots, that it may be opened to political conversation, for it is the only possible solution. We\'ve shown that we support the Eukadin dialogue and the deal. After the first legislation of Spain, which has been governed by closeness, and re-establishment, a new stage has been opened. Progress has recovered a part of its scope. We\'ve come forward in the way of the agreement, but the notebooks are still open with the essential issues we\'re going to have to deal with in the next few months. This is our vision of the situation: we want to add, to collaborate so that Euskadi continues to grow, has greater capacities and resources, is more open and recognized in the world. Our commitment is that, based on the legitimacy of representative democracy, society acquires a greater role and involvement; to grow, to build action from respect, responsibility and the pact. On this basis I propose my intervention, I present the four pillars that structure the governance agenda: human development and social integration; employment and economic recovery; coexistence and human rights; and more and better self-government. They are our pillars in a context of profound transformations. We have gone through a serious economic crisis that has affected the well-being of citizens and social cohesion. We live in a time of change that affects all areas of public policy. We cannot disregard everything that has been created and built so far, nor can we install ourselves in an acrylic accommodation. Self-congratulation is the worst criterion of orientation. It is true that, in the economic and social sphere, certain enterprises in the industrial sector are having serious difficulties in maintaining their activity. It is true that growth is not accompanied by the creation of quality jobs to the extent we would like. It is true that population ageing is affecting the future sustainability of essential health and social protection services. It is true that progress in equity in education must be accompanied by a determined commitment to excellence. It is true that the internationalization of Euskadi will require a greater effort shared by all institutions, companies, universities and entities. It is true that we must step up innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises and tackle with determination the digital transformation of the economy and industry. It is up to us to respond to these challenges that represent the future of Euskadi and symbolize the common good. Achieving this is a shared responsibility between institutions and society. Working together for the common good is the meaning of Auzolan, the spirit of our country. Our model is sustainable human development. The most competitive countries are those with the greatest development and social equality; there is no advanced welfare state without a strong economy that supports it. We allocate two thirds of our operating budget to social policies; it is the basis of our idea. Building a fairer Basque society means being more competitive: we are implementing an effective economic policy, capable of promoting the viability of companies and generating employment, capable of transforming wealth into public policies that guarantee essential services, modernise the country and allow us to invest in the new economic sectors of the future. Our model is social, it\'s about ensuring human development and cohesion. The first objective of public policies is to guarantee the dignity of people and their essential living conditions. The poverty rate in Euskadi is the lowest in the state, but we have assumed the objective of reducing it by 20% this legislature. Our commitment is to improve management and effectiveness to better care for people who need it most, preserving the Basque system of social protection. Our model promotes sustainable growth and job creation. We will focus on competitiveness by strengthening the actions of Plan 4 I (investment, innovation, internationalisation and industry). Moving forward on sustainable growth means achieving more and better jobs, reducing the unemployment rate below 10% and helping to provide work experience to 20,000 young people. We have approved the new Industrialization Plan; our objective is to ensure that industry reaches 25% of the gross domestic product. Public-private investment in innovation is key to future development, and we have committed an annual growth of 5% of the public budget in innovation. Our model is social, it encourages growth. Our model is transparent and based on collaboration. Access to key Government projects and initiatives through Irekia has been facilitated for citizens. We have approved and published the country\'s fifteen objectives, government programme, strategic planning, legislative programme, new Economic and Employment Reactivation Framework 2020, 2017 budgets and economic guidelines 2018. This management model aligns with the European Union\'s 2020 strategy, also with the United Nations agenda, which commits the seventeen sustainable development goals classified in five areas: people, prosperity, the planet, peace and paternality. The Government\'s 15 strategic plans are integrated into this model. Today ten plans are in place, and five will be adopted this year: coexistence and human rights; governance and public innovation; employment; euskera; and strategic plan for tourism, trade and consumption. The strategy has contrasted with the actors involved in all cases. Today, 165 of the 175 commitments of the government program have actions in progress (i.e. more than 90%). The initiatives under way are 539 out of 655 (over 80%). The Government\'s legislative programme includes 28 bills; we have adopted four (ports and maritime transport, energy sustainability of the public administration, anti-doping law, and cultural heritage). The aim is to adopt this year\'s draft law on access to and exercise of the professions of sport. And to this is added the processing of three proposals of law proposed by the groups that support the government: vocational training; transparency and citizen participation; and organization and functioning of the public sector. In addition, last semester Parliament passed the following laws: Amendment of Law 4/2014, establishing the Institute of Memory, Coexistence and Human Rights; General Budgets of the Community; consolidated text of the Emergency Management Act. The degree of compliance with the Government\'s legislative programme is above the targets set for the first year. Our model compromises rigour in public management. The Government works with the economic and budgetary framework 2017-2020 as a tool to ensure the essential principles of good governance. The macroeconomic scenario is of moderate growth in the world economy, with risk factors in Europe such as the negative impact of Brexit, electoral processes, interest rates, exchange rate or oil price. In Euskadi we will move from increases in gross domestic product in the environment of 3% to increases of 2.2% by 2020. The scenario in our case is positive for four reasons: it is high growth in relation to the environment; it allows for sustained job creation between 1.9 % of this year and 1.3 % of 2020, when the unemployment rate would be below 10 %; growth will be compatible with an increase in productivity close to 1 %, and the growth model will be balanced, with the power of industry and services. In any case, the budgetary scenario for 2020 is going to be conditioned by the trend of spending and the objectives included in the government programme, also taking into account possible deceleration and stabilization processes. Some programme objectives with budgetary implications should be highlighted: general commitment to maintaining social policies and the quality of services (remember that health and education account for 60 per cent of expenditure); raising innovation expenditure by 5 per cent annually; providing initial work experience to 20,000 young people; population ageing and increased demand for health services; infrastructure renewal in education and health; maintenance of income guarantee income and subjective housing rights; and support policies for families. There is no doubt that the economic and budgetary framework envisages an increase in expenditure. This framework is further affected by the effect of fiscal consolidation (the deficit will be reduced to 0,4 % in 2018 and will be zero in 2020), and in addition the European expenditure rule limits budget availability in terms of investment. In short, the rational, rigorous and adjusted management of public resources will remain essential for the entire period. This necessary condition may not be sufficient, because the sustainability of public policies requires ensuring financial sufficiency in a zero deficit scenario, where expenditure for each financial year cannot exceed revenue. The economic and budgetary framework 2020 defines the government\'s management model and guides the need to move forward since the agreement. Our model of sustainable human development is social and economic, transparent and collaborative. Our model takes precedence over the deal. Society demands and appreciates the agreements, and the model of the Eucomunion is to give a priority to the agreement. I\'ll point out one that\'s of special importance. An agreement on how to update the quapo and the Economy of the Covenant with the Spanish Government. That was stupid. In July the Mist Committee signed these: On the one hand, in order to update the Economy of the Covenant, on the other hand, we made an arrangement on the deck between 2007 and 2021. This agreement guarantees a 15-year-old financial peace. Besides the economic importance of this agreement, I want to remark political significance, it\'s refectional in what\'s planning a new relationship with the state Euracdi. The difference of relation, based on mutual respect and knowledge, is the key of the Euscal auto-beron. The system of the treaty unites in one historical significance and practical efficiency. After the forum-abolation, it connects us with a portion of our original independence, and preserves us as a useful and remative system. The Economic concert is the key to our autogony. It offers a strong foundation to build a new model of relation to the state, and even in the sphere of politics and jurisdictions. This system includes: Number one. The treatyship between Eukadi and the State. Both the Concerts and the Navarre treaty have a connection with our own historical rights and fortunes. He acknowledges the power of governing himself to the land of Esscal. It\'s the one-sided one, i.e. you can\'t change the one side. Number two. He has a legal character both in the State and in Europe. The treaty introduces almost a confessional in the tax and finance. Third. To the nature of solidarity and co-ordination. The concert system places a separate relationship between Euskade and the State. This peculiar relation has no privileges, because it took a one-sided risk from Euskaca. Fourth. A system of difference and mutual guarantees. The treaty has established rules or rules of mechanism to solve conflicts. They are effective tools, and offer a system for support of the treaty obtained. The treaty, legality, solidarity, and impartiality, are supported by the Economics Concertical Concern, as the keystone of our self-organization. In my opinion, treaties, legalities, alliances, and differences give us occasion to consider the relations of the Basques and the State. I will return to this subject in the last part of my essay. I\'ve made our example this far. Now, I\'m going to go and do what I did in the past ten months. As reference, and without intending to mention everything, I shall mention the most remarkable initiative. Economy and employment. It may be remarked that the approval of the new 2020 scope program is: It has the total number of 8.800 million euros and has taken the purpose of lowering the rate of unemployment by 10%. They\'re on duty to action plan and industry plan, investment 1,225 million dollars. It is obvious that the recovery of industry, as well as the development of production indexes, is due to the development of the wallet and exports. We\'re moving all the measures to help the real economy. We have made an investment of 84 million in the Enforcement Program to encourage and aid their corporate conversion in poor regions, and to help small and middle-class companies out of business. In the first sector, we\'ve accepted assistance for the transforming and marketing projects, and also to promote employment in the countryside. We\'ve managed to get one of EI F Good\'s International Partucerations from Euskka. I also want to stress support in improving tourist competitiveness, and modernize corporate programs. In direct connection with the Building, 100 million euros to the preparation programs of people in unemployment, to promote employment for people who have some kind of disabilities, to work, to work, to work, and to young people\'s jobs. In public business, we have accepted the new 4,375 Squares, called by public offers, to improve health, education and security services. We\'ve started a plan for inspection, and we\'ve made this commitment. reviewing contracts with partial signed jobs. In the quality of the intellect, the table for the social conversation is considered a fundamental goal, because it has made the first meeting in this legislation. Internationalization and innovation. We\'ve opened a new SPI office in London and started the Brexit Board with other organizations and economic operators. We\'re starting the Cyberecurity Center and it\'s going to become an operational reality next year. We have agreed with the Spanish Government that the ESS Bilbao will participate in the European Union of the Sub-Protractal Research. We put 164 million euros in RIS3 intelligent programmes. Subjugates. The third line of Bilbo\'s subway has started. We have signed agreements for determining capital access to the works of a high-speed train with the Spanish Government. We renew our commitment to environment and patience. Among the principal works against the floods, the Gobelas and the first phase of the Riverland are finished; the second stage will be carried on between the ferns and the Galdas. and the second stage will take place in Martute, and the Kadagua has also begun to cross the river. They\'re doing the works of the Mundaian Sound and it\'s finished. We signed a plot for hydraulic substructure with the Aradic Fordunda, an investment of $74 million euros. In the engagement which forms social policies, I shall remark: In the health service, the University Hospital for the U.A. and the new site at the Basurto Hospital with $65 million investments. We\'ve opened new services at the Urduli Hospital, and even the medical centers of Kanpezu and Amreadu. We\'ve created the Bioraba Medical Research Institute and the Mom\'s Euskal Bank. We\'ve invested 254 million in education to improve substructures in Besheain, Ait, Legion, or Advice. We\'ve opened up new science structures in Gastename and Leiia. We\'ve agreed to the university\'s company 2020 Agendas with these goals: to transfer knowledge, to prepare human capital, and to encourage it to work with the students. We\'ve put hundreds of new specialization programs on the career team. 176 million euros have been directed to the schools, to the educational education, to the programmes of innovation and continual preparation, or to services. The betting on public education is the priority. We\'ve started a joint process to get a new education union. We\'ve made a bet on equity and excellence. Social support. We\'ve presented a proposition of the grounds for improving the rent to ensure the income. I think it\'s just fun to put 14 million each year in order to start the social service bag, because the Finance Council created it. 95 million euros have been designed to promote the activities of the third sector, to pay attention to the state of social distress, to support the families with children, to support their labor and their family in union, to the productions of equality and to aid the bichtimes of the strength of the genus. Collaboration. We\'ve accepted 40 million euros and IV. This is the process of accepting a direct plan, with the intent to renew policies for development and collaboration. Equality. The principle of equality is that we consider the plan and the preference to any kind of sexual event. There\'s equality in our shared commitment. Security. The agreement obtained with the Spanish Government has been very important within the Security Committee: The planile of the edge has been established, composed of eight thousand edges, and the growth of generation has been enabled. Thanks to this two-way agreement, we could make a call for 300 new squares, and we\'ll make a call for 300 more before the year\'s over. The agreement with the Security Committee makes it easier for you to enter the border when it is called an anti-organized intelligence center and access to the European databases. We are bargaining with the criteria for the full information of SENSIO\'s information, as well as with the Europol Unit. Justice. We have accepted the support of 14 million euros in order that people who are in a particularly weak condition should have a judgment for justice. As to the function of justice and attention, it is our object to place the victim as the hero of the penal process, to restore the execution and execution of all its rights. Cultural and euscipation. We\'ve signed a contract to cooperate in the politics of language with the Navarro and the Northerners. We share an engagement to encourage and normalize the use of a Basque. We\'ve agreed to an investment of 22 million euros to make Eukadin culture. We have strengthened the wager for the creation and the culture industry as the axis of the growth of our country, as well from the inner view as from the international view. We invested 66 million euros in the housing policy. A great impulse has been given to the public hire of excessive prices, and to promote the new apartment by means of the programme of the survival program. We\'ve been pushing it through the rehabilitation of buildings and town-newing and -returning program Renove. We\'re working on the rule of the subjective right to the housing and the inspection of the buildings, the rules, the rules, and the rules, to force them into it this year. In public government, we have formed the Council of Public Regional Policy. We have made an agreement with the Spanish Government, that no means, no appeals should be presented to the local law of local local institutions. In like manner, after seven years, we have concluded with the Spanish Government, in order to have this information in our power: The finances for the common security firms and the departments of business. In conclusion, we\'ve signed the city contract here in Gaste, with the mayor\'s commitment to making a $40 million investment. These are the main facts of the government in ten months of the legislature. We\'re a government in action. In summary, the basis of the programme and strategic planning is under way, and the legislative programme is being implemented above expectations. Support programmes and measures launched exceed EUR 1 billion. The agreements with the Spanish Government in the Joint Concert Commission and the Security Board have meant a recognition of the uniqueness of our self-government and bilaterality. I have presented the model of sustainable human development, I have summarized the main facts of the Government. I now refer to our priorities, the response to the global challenges I raised in the investment debate. Priority one, education. We have launched a participatory reflection process to reach an agreement that structures and strengthens the stability and quality of education, ensuring equity and advancing towards excellence. We promote policies that integrate quality. We bet on the culture of evaluation, innovation and research. We give priority to the formation of the educational community. We advance in the plan of improvement with the extension of plurilingualism or comprehensive education, with the Basque as central axis vehicle. We have strengthened our dual vocational training model in relation to the company and extended it to the university. I recognize the problems: we have made progress in equity, we have to improve in excellence. Our challenge is to achieve results consistent with the economic effort we make. Two, demographic challenge and youth bet. We have approved the new housing policy and the youth employment programme. We have expanded family and birth support, reconciliation programmes, education from 0 to 3, or care for the elderly. We have defined the policy of integration of immigration, working with outlaws, Eudel and the third sector. We proceed to the renewal and rejuvenation of staff in the public administration. I recognize the problems: we have much to make progress on all the measures envisaged in the Strategic Plan for Children and Families. Three, innovation and digitisation. We have adopted the smart specialization strategy RIS3. We have approved the industrialization plan, as well as the investment attraction and innovation programme. I highlight the expansion of the Bizkaia Technology Park on the Left Margen. I recognize the problems: we have to make progress in supporting the real economy, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, in supporting innovation, internationalisation and investment. We need to shift growth to a higher generation of quality jobs, reduce job insecurity, especially among young people, women or working people incorporated after the labour reform. Priority four, internationalization of Basque Country. We encourage the promotion of Euskadi as a tourist and cultural attraction. We are updating the Basque Country 2020 strategy, which we will present at the beginning of the year, with these seven priorities: Euroregion Aquitaine-Euskadi, a project that grows with the incorporation of Navarre and the new Aquitaine, as well as the creation of the first territorial institution in Iparralde. Basque vision on the future of the European Union, a document committed to the working meeting held with President Jean-Claude Juncker and which interferes with the objective of a more social and democratic Europe. Euskadi\'s own presence in seventy-six countries of the world. Network of six strategic partners in the territories of future opportunity for Euskadi. Participation in seventy-five international networks. Social Basque Global Network with the aim of projecting Euskadi in the world, reinforcing the participation of the Basque etxeak. Basque Country 2030 Agenda for the implementation of the seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in Euskadi. I recognize the problems: to gain an external dimension requires greater internal coordination, combining efforts of External Action, SPRI, Basquetour or Etxepare Institute, institutionally, in the consortium of internationalization, with economic agents, companies, universities, technological centres, chambers of commerce and public institutions. A small country needs more shared work, more Auzolan, to grow on the global stage. Education, rejuvenation, digitization, internationalization, this is the engine of a Euskadi that wants to grow. We have passed the toughest phase of crisis and recession; since March 2013 Euskadi has been growing and gradually creating employment. It is fifty-three months with saw teeth, but in positive trend. We keep the growth forecast for this year at around 3%. Employment creation is progressing, and in the second quarter employment in terms of equivalent jobs has increased by 2.2%. The unemployment rate is 11 %, three points less than the previous year. Are we on the right track? Yeah, but we don\'t settle. It is up to us to maintain this course, to ensure a scenario of stability and certainty, to concentrate the effort and to collaborate. We have the opportunity to give new impetus to the Basque economy and to recover all the jobs lost during the crisis. This is the priority of the country and this is the priority of the Government: more and better employment. This is the first two columns which structure our program: human development and social integration, and employment and economic recovery. I shall now take the third column\'s view: partnership and human rights. Then I\'ll end up with a political view of the future of the automatically. Coincidence and human rights. We just emerged from a dark, traumatic period of violence and terrorism after some decades. There are many wounds left of suffering and injustice, which have not yet been healed. On the other hand, in the globalized world, XXI. the new calendar of the subject affairs has been created: the state of refugees, migrations, religion, and culture, new distinctions and forms of injustice, international terrorism, or war. These are the issues that develops the news of partnership and Human Rights at the 2020 Strague Plan. We want to maintain the course of our strategy, because the plan of previous peace and partnership has been a very useful tool. We are a generation known to peace, and our labour is to secure our co-existence to come. The Recent Project has the following precedents: In the name of Red Beetle, it\'s an expression of a victims\' autochick. The performances I\'d like to hear from victims. On the 20th of February, for the victims of police competition, the 11th of March for the victims of terrorism, and May 14th, for the victims of Fancism. In these proceedings, for the first time, all the groups of the legislature have participated. To go forward on the way of making legal confession to all victims, with the approval of the law of confession to the victims, which had hitherto ceased to be protected. Adventures to a new policy of social society, and to promote self-critic processes. It\'s obvious that it\'s important that the law of the 8th of April, that it\'s permanently and unconditionally disarmed, shouldn\'t be given up by the 8th of April. Armlessing has been a very important step, absolutely necessary, and during the process of undoing and disappearing forever. It must be acknowledged that the government of France had a right to disarm, and the position which the Spanish Government kept. Remember, starting high school is a landmark. It is the result of a variety of interactions which should be appreciated and confessed. Here\'s a note that shows how valuable the work of Eucharin is: On June 1th, after having once been with other high authorities, I had the opportunity to join Juan Manuel Santos the President of Colombia and other managers. For the government of Colombia, our experiences are very valuable; the idea of education for peace, of police, of police, of victims, of social society, of autocracy, of social education, and of culture for human rights. I wish to remark the commitment to the observation of truth, of justice, and of all the victims. Looking into the future doesn\'t mean we should forget the memory of the victims and the honor of the past. Our program assures us that all victims deserve a confession and observation. On June 26th, we filed a report coming out of the Amancture, from 1960 to 1978 to make the statement and observation of police abuse. Thanks to this job, the 174 victim has made the statement and attention they deserved. This decree was admitted in 2012, and its management shows the legality and compliance of the new law which this legislature has adopted from 1978 to 1999. We\'re working for the Spanish Government to remove the appeal against this law. Prison policy. The report presented to President Mariano Rajoy of Spain, the prison policy, and the new social situation in order to be taken care of. The proposal develops its programmes in word and law. Their object is to revolutionize the legal and banana ways. We must mark the decision that had been announced in July by the prisoners. They accept legal and individual paths, which spreads a field of opportunity. The commitment to our government program is to promote prison policy based on these four legal principles: individualization, humanity, the confession of the caused injury, and the re-enjoyment of society. We plan to penetrate into the line of the primer justice in Europe and to end the policy of evading the prisoners. This separation has only two consequences, both bad ones; the suffering which families suffer, and the disreputation which is produced in the social life of the Basques, in the political and in the institutional order. I share a hopeful look at solidarity with the victims of terrorism. On 10 March, on the eve of the European Day of Victims of Terrorism, the Basque Government convened a concentration in which social, political and institutional representations took part to express solidarity with the victims of terrorism. This act is an unprecedented manifestation of unity, because all parliamentary groups took an active part in it. Basque society is moving forward, and this unity is a source of hope. With this hopeful look we face the plan of coexistence and human rights. The Governing Council will approve it after having received 10 documents with input from parliamentary groups and associations. We have considered twenty-six proposals and incorporated sixty-three inputs into the starting document. I propose an invitation to share its seven strategic challenges: the orderly end of violence and terrorism; the next step will be the effective and definitive unilateral dissolution of ETA, an express objective of our government program that in what is in our hands we will favour, because it is a social requirement and a necessity for coexistence; clarification of the past that serves to know the reality and impact of terrorism and violence; public policies of victims so that they all feel cared for and recognized, Gogora Institute as a space to share public policies of memory; normalize and pacify penal policy and of reintegration, in accordance with the legal principles; project of human rights education, oriented towards commitment to peace, diversity and solidarity, and promotion of a culture of coexistence, solidarity, cooperation and human rights in line with the United Nations 2030 agenda. All parliamentary groups can share these challenges and exemplify before citizens the social encounter for the coexistence that we advocate. I plan to apply the will for dialogue and the spirit of agreement demonstrated in the Gogora Institute to the memory and coexistence of this Parliament. Dialogue and agreement are the most important strategic choice in the field of coexistence. Promoting this culture of coexistence requires a critical memory of what has happened, and I am aware of our institutional responsibility. In this sense, on 30 September I will participate with the president of Navarre, Uxue Barkos, in an act of recognition to the Basque citizens confined in the Gurs concentration camp during the Civil War. The recovery of the list of persons detained there has been possible thanks to the Government\'s commitment in the exile of Lehendakari Agirre. This brings together a line of commitment to freedom, democracy and human rights from the first Basque Government to the present day, a shared commitment to which we continue today. I conclude this paragraph by referring to international terrorism on religious grounds. Recent attacks in Catalonia have increased concern about this threat. In June, I proposed the creation of a working group with the participation of the Departments of Security; Employment and Social Policy; Education; Justice and Labour; and the General Secretariat for Human Rights, Co-existence and Cooperation. Our approach is based on some assumptions that shape the diagnosis: to recognize the enormous complexity of the threat, to accept that there is no infallible strategy, and to assume that the response to the threat must be international. The President of the Commission himself raised last week the need for a European coordination unit for police intelligence and security services. Not everything is in our hand, but we must do everything in our hand. The Basque Government works to respond to this threat from four areas: prevention of the violent radicalization of our community, police response, intercultural and interreligious integration in society, and contribution to international efforts. The framework document that we are drawing up and which we are presenting in this Parliament will develop an action plan on these four axes. Our mission is to strengthen the culture of peace and coexistence in Euskadi. It is necessary to elevate the legacy of cultural capital to the highest category of shared value. Living together is living with. Today, 21 September, today, the International Day of Peace, sponsored by the United Nations General Assembly, is celebrated. This year\'s motto is ""Together for Peace: Respect, Security and Dignity for All."" I make my own the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations on this day, and I quote: ""In times of insecurity, communities of different appearance become scapegoats. We must resist the cynicism that divides communities and presents our neighbors as \'the others\'. Together, let us address intolerance and defend human rights. Let us build bridges, let us turn fear into hope."" So far the date. This is the strategic challenge of coexistence for Basque and European society in the coming times: living together in peace, being free together. The last part of this intervention addresses the fourth pillar, the vision of the future of Basque self-government. This issue is being shared by all groups in the self-government presentation. I structure my intervention by taking as a reference the commitments made in our government program. The first commitment is to advance the full implementation of the Gernika Statute. We have adopted an updated report on non-transferred competences, a detailed report updating the so-called 1993 Zubia Report, completed in 1995 and 2001 with the report on priorities, all approved by this Parliament. This report is presented in four blocks. First, transfers made between 1994 and 2011. In particular, there have been thirty-five transfers in these eighteen years, the most relevant relating to the administration of justice, motorways, scientific research and innovation, or public employment service. The second block, five transfers that were listed as outstanding and are updated due to changes in the legal-economic reality or the impact of European Union policies. Thirdly, six new proposals for partial transfers or for new realities. And fourth block, updated list of pending transfers, with thirty-one subjects. The work carried out is aimed at achieving full compliance with the Gernika Statute. It is a question of lighting up a favourable position in order to achieve the thirty-seven outstanding transfers, which must be negotiated and agreed in the Joint Transfer Committee. Our Government has declared and demonstrated a willingness for negotiation and agreement; we expect a reciprocal attitude on the part of the Spanish Government. The path of bilaterality, reactivated in the Joint Concert Commission and the Security Board, is the path that can enable us to settle the statutory litigation and complete the thirty-seven pending transfers, after thirty-seven years of non-compliance. The second commitment of the government programme is the achievement of a new legal-political framework for Euskadi. Our Government will maintain the attitude of facilitating progress in the work of the paper. More specifically, we express our readiness, as we say in the text, to ""agree with the greatest consensus an open but concrete formulation of the bases and principles for the reform and updating of self-government"". This document of bases and principles should serve as a starting point for the drafting of the joint text of a new political proposal for the future for Euskadi. In relation to this commitment, I assume, as lehendakari, the premise that the ideal of self-government is in harmony and coexistence between different identities, on the basis of respect and mutual recognition. I repeat the premise: the ideal of self-government is found in harmony and coexistence between different identities, on the basis of respect and mutual recognition. Since the launch of the paper, I have been called upon to take a stand on various occasions in relation to the future of self-government. I have always been proactive and at the same time respectful of the work of the paper, and I will continue to be. I am aware that self-government is our common good. It unites us with its contribution to well-being, economic growth, social justice and equity; it unites us with the will to strengthen our people, to achieve a higher quality of life for a society that we want to be responsible and protagonist of their future. Today, with the aim of helping to promote maximum consensus, and consistent with the premise expressed, I raise, as lehendakari, five reflections aimed at parliamentary representation, in order to facilitate the development and progress of its work: to place the question of Basque self-government in the political sphere of the European Union; to analyse the recognition of Basque as a nation and the consideration of historical rights as a constituent power; to offer ways of extending self-government and moving towards a new status; to establish the concept of bilaterality and its effective implementation; and to have a precise decision-making capacity in the field of the State, the European Union and international action. Reiterating my willingness to contribute to the work of the paper, I set out my first reflection: to place Euskadi on the European horizon. The united Europe was, since its foundation, the political project to build a federation of nations and peoples around a shared project. Today, the demand for greater recognition and participation of regions, cities and non-state nations is a general trend. Political and decision-making must be transferred to the peoples and nations that integrate European diversity; it is key to vertebrate the European project and connect it with citizens in an upward process. In this new scenario, it would be necessary to set up a structure based on the principle of subsidiarity that allows for a division of competences and also of sovereignty. To advance in a model capable of uniting the positive elements of confederal and federal models, which limits the exclusivity of the nation-state both internally and internationally. This path could also open up a constructive alternative to the inevitable reform of the State model, which must start from the assumption of its own plurinational reality. In this sense, it is important to remember that our government program contemplates that the autonomous model in force in the Spanish state needs a reformulation. Second reflection, Euskadi\'s recognition as a nation and consideration of historical rights as a constituent power. Euskadi is a community with its own national identity, from a historical, political and institutional perspective as well as cultural. Euskadi is a political nation in a decentralized, plurinational state. Based on this recognition, it is necessary to clarify the scope of the political power of each national community. The State has the obligation and the need to seek a political solution to the legitimate national aspirations of Euskadi and Catalonia. There\'s no other way. Euskadi has a specific legitimacy, expressly recognized in the first additional provision of the Constitution, which protects and respects the historical rights of the outlying territories. It is the case of Navarra, and of Araba, Gipuzkoa and Bizkaia. To this legitimacy must be added the single additional provision of the Statute of Gernika. The Constitutional Court itself has established the importance and scope of historical rights. This legitimacy has two consequences: in principle, Euskadi is undoubtedly a national reality of its own; in the field of political power, Euskadi is legitimated to agree a bilateral pact with the State that will establish and guarantee its powers and powers. We are a nation, and we are still in the process of national construction. Euskadi and the Basque territories have their own national will; that is, the will of a differentiated political project, which does not fully coincide with that proposed by certain areas of State representation. Historical rights are one of the elements that have helped to shape the sense of the Basque nation; they are a unique and legitimizing element of our constituent power. In coherence, the new status would be the legal-political expression of a historical national identity with a desire to survive, an updated institutional expression of a collective identity that was already manifested in 1936 and 1979, and which now reiterates its vocation to renew itself also as a meeting point of society with its constitutive plurality. Third reflection, ways of expanding self-government and the new status. We start from the recognition of the uniqueness of Euskadi with two references: the first additional provision of the Constitution, which requires an up-to-date reading based on mutual trust, and the single additional provision of the Statute, which states that the acceptance of the autonomy regime established by the Statute does not imply a waiver by the Basque people of the rights which, as such, could have corresponded to it by virtue of its history, which may be updated in accordance with the legal order. I continue to advocate the institutionalization of the right of citizenship to be consulted on its future in a legal and agreed manner, combining the democratic principle and the principle of legality. I believe that it is necessary to establish legal channels so that political communities that, by express and clear decision of their parliamentary institutions of self-government, wish to consult citizens about their future can do so with full guarantees. I would like to recall that, in my view, the great challenge today is to achieve a plural and solid consensus on a great project of self-government. I propose the possibility of agreeing a new political pact expressing our own and differentiated nationality, such as the first article of the Statute of Gernika. The new pact would be justified in the desire to have the highest levels of self-government, better instruments to develop our personality and respond effectively to the global challenges of the country, among which I highlight a social economy with a human face. The new framework should lead to a renewal and strengthening of the agreed nature of our political institutions. There is no pact without a reciprocal system of guarantees, so that the interpretation and fulfilment of the agreed terms is not left to the discretion of one of the parties. Fourth reflection, bias and remunerative application. In the first part, as I have said, the Economic Covenant has shown, that it is the way to a speciall and effectual relation between Euchardi and the State. It is a positive historical experience, which can be an example to extend itself to the sphere of political relations. The economic and political treaty would be the two principal columns of the new state of auto-gourage. These two columns considered, it would be necessary that special contrivances should be made to rectify the differences of jurisdiction by bias and agreement. Besides the establishment of preventive mechanism, it would be proper, for instance, to make a couple of forums of arbitration, a committee to guarantee the state. The goal would be to update the auto-engine and renew our jurisdictions: To strengthen the field of power, which has not yet been established to the members of the community, and to increase the jurisdiction of the public power, which has already been acknowledged and transmitted to us, and which is acknowledged by the State of Eukadi. By this means, our own jurisdictions may be organized in five different areas: Jurisdictions that reflect the peculiarity of the Basques: a culture of euccany and eascal, a civil law, a regulation of the Economic Concertation, and an organizational organisation. A set of exclusive rights based on the standard tradition. He includes the system of public employments, the bordering, and the administration of justice; in which case the union of judicial power, and the privilege of the Supreme Court, are limited to a doctrine. The vast number of privileges which they acknowledge to the Eucharistic institutions of nature, and to the sub-relations of their country. A set of meetings and social protections and system powers together. The essential reason for this is the system of social operators from Euskka. An association relating to the legal and relations of public administrations. In this frame, it would be necessary to acknowledge the power of our fellow-citizens in order to organize the Administration of Justice and its own judicial system. Fifth deliberation, a certain ability to determine in the state, European Union, and international territory. According to the regulations in the European Council, he ought to have a proper tool for co-operation with robbers, Zubera, Lower Navarre, and the Navarre Community of Navarre. That is to say, with the land of the eucaia. The update of the Auto-gourage should allow the delegation from Euka to be in European Union and international institutions. In the European frame, it should be allowed to participate in the international agreements which make Euskakia share in his own hands. The chance to make our two-way deals and share in the European institutions. And also to control the principles of subsidy and proportionality by the representation system of the jurisdiction of President Junker. In fine, it would be a privilege to promote the American social institutions, culture, and sports, in order to complete the integration of the institutions of the nation. So far the five reflections I share to help advance the goal of consensus on the basis and principles for the reform and updating of self-government. Pact and democracy underpin the political organization of Euskadi. I appeal to focus the effort on our own path. The Basque track is based on the legitimizing element of historical rights, which must be claimed and strengthened together in order to further advance the national and social construction of Euskadi. This objective can be achieved with a pact agreement that assumes the concept of cosovereignty or shared sovereignty and is based on competencies, ability to make, financial sufficiency, resources to make, and bilaterality, not to interfere and compromise to compromise. I plan to reflect on a new status of self-government that recognizes the uniqueness of the Basque nation and extends the experience of fiscal and financial concertation to the political relationship, including an effective system of guarantees for compliance with the covenant. Economic concert and political concert are two pillars that allow to fill the maximum content, and at the highest level, the effective powers of Euskadi with all guarantees. I put in place a pact agreement that involves the recognition of the national reality of its own and the assumption of the multi-nationality of the State. I consider it necessary to make progress in the legal-political, as well as social and cultural, recognition of the Basque, Catalan and Galician national realities, in addition to the Spanish one. I consider it necessary to adapt this recognition within the framework of a Europe that bases its union on respect for the various peoples and cultures that make up it; a Europe of multilevel, more social and also more democratic governance. Advancing in a political decision advises assuming plurinational culture, facing with a constructive vision the redistribution of the sovereignty of the State, and favoring the defence of the identity of their respective peoples. The exit of the territorial political labyrinth is on the horizon of the confederal state. I\'m done. I have started my speech by appealing to the values of realism, stability and consensus. At the beginning of this political course we have the opportunity to combine these values in relation to five fundamental issues: One, draft budgets 2018. We are drawing up the preliminary draft with three references: economic-budgetary guidelines, revenue forecasts of the Finance Council, and new fiscal policy. In this regard, we have contributed to the assessment of fiscal reform; it is now up to the parties to open a political negotiation for the General Councils to approve the new measures. Our position is to maintain a balance in the twofold objective of ensuring the sustainability of public policies and the need to reactivate the economy and generate quality jobs. Adopting the budget requires more support than the parties that support the Government themselves. Our readiness is open to dialogue and negotiation with all groups. Two, income-guarantee reform and Basque social protection system. For almost three decades this has been the instrument that has demonstrated the solidarity of Basque citizens and strengthened our cohesion. The Government has put forward 20 measures in this Parliament to improve management and ensure the sustainability of income-guarantee income. The aim is to improve the living conditions of the most needy and to promote the ultimate end of aid, i.e. to facilitate the employability of people of working age. It is up to us to apply realism and stability to give the system a higher level of control and efficiency. It is up to us to strengthen the institutional and political consensus to preserve the Basque system of social protection as a whole. Three, formation. We have opened a participatory process to reach an agreement for education, with the aim of strengthening the stability and quality of education by promoting its modernization. We have signed the university-enterprise agreement, with the commitment to extend dual training in both vocational training and university. We will promote the university system on the principles of self-requirement, effectiveness and co-responsibility. We work in collaboration with the business fabric to facilitate an initial work experience for 20,000 young people. The integration of youth into work is a priority that requires the cooperation of economic and social actors. Fourth, co-existence plan and human rights 2020. We will open a new stage based on the orderly end of violence and terrorism. We will give priority to public policies of care and recognition to victims. We intend to standardize prison policy. The Gogora Institute has been a model of consensual action since its creation; our proposal is to extend to the relationship between all groups this model that prioritizes the objective of advancing in the social encounter for coexistence. Five, move towards full compliance with the Statute and update self-government. Our aim is to open a dialogue and negotiation table with the Spanish Government on statutory compliance. We need parliamentary, political and social support. I call for an agreement between all the groups allowing us to complete the Statute of Gernika. I also call for priority to be given to consensus in the elaboration of the bases and principles for the reform and updating of self-government. The internal agreement, the bilateral relationship framework and the recognition of the plurinational reality of the State set the stage for demonstrating political capacity to agree on a new status of self-government. They\'re founded on our project. We are aware of the challenges and difficulties which the present society has before it. We have the whole belief that society and the vice of institutions are the hero of a nation composed of the leading characters, who have been built up from below in a society of society and of society. That\'s the way, that\'s the attitude. I repeat: the word agreement is the key. We look to the future and the future, and look at it with the powers of attaining its objects from Euskaca; The unemployment is less than 10%, the violence and terrorism and the stage is permanently closed, and the update of the self-organization and the taking and growing up in the world as a Basque Country. I take a positive look at our people. I said in my excitement that I was proud of the last years of the crisis in the euscal society. It\'s been a hard, hard way, too long and it\'s over, it\'s not over yet. I said, too, that I began this new stage with illusions. I\'m holding on to this illusion. It\'s bigger now, when I see Euskakia advancing on step by step, and we\'re able to move forward, always doing this way together. Thank you. [[Applause]]', 'Chief of Parliament, members of the legislature, chiefs of departments, ladies and gentlemen, good days to all. We want to begin this discussion about universal politics at a moment important for the Basques, a critical moment from the economic, political, and institutional point of view. I\'ll introduce my explanation into two parts. First, I\'ll report the main initiative that we\'ve developed to fulfill the government program. In the second place, I will show the initiative we shall develop in order to give a new impulse to our three principal commitments: to revive economy and employment, to promote peace and partnership, to agree to a new political status for the Basque future. First of all, we have a solid basis that will lead us to a situation of more hope. Our assets are the stability of the institutions, the beginning of economic convalescence, and the progress of the course of regulating peace and fellowship. Today we look forward to the future to propose what we shall do, but we must consider how we have reached this situation. The foundation of excitement is solid. From the point of view of the funding, we\'ve done a lot of effort to unite the taxes in the past events. From the point of view of society, ""person targets"" is a strong project to protect those who are most in need. It is solid to look at in the eyes of the economy, to reinforce it, and to recover it, because the beginning of its recovery is already there. She\'s doing a song called ""MékMolly."" We haven\'t finished our work, at all events, but we\'re on the right track. If we\'ve had reasons to be more efficient, we\'ve always had realism. In Europe, in our circle of reference, we have great tension. A terrible humanitarian crisis is happening, we\'ll have to prove our capacity for reception and solidarity. Ger\'s victims are on their way to Europe for security and better future. The crisis of exile will continue to be a challenge, humanitarian and solidarium Europe will have to respond in concert. With this we live the moments of economic uncertainty. China is a proof that even the second economy in the world is affecting the economy of America and Europe. We hope to maintain that tendency to strengthen economics. We\'re predicting a raw Euskadin product that 2,5% this year will increase and that jobs will be on job %1,6% of the full-time jobs. In 2016, the growth will be 2,5%, and the job generation will go up to 7%. If we hold our current conditions, we\'d get the rate of unemployment below 10 percent. That\'s the main challenge, raising and creating high-quality jobs. As to the state of politics, at the end of the year 2015, we\'ll have two major elections. On Sunday, the Catalurians will show what they want, respecting what is decided by those elections, these two appointments may exercise a great influence on the political jurisdiction of the State. Due to the general elections of December, a new government will be created, and we hope that we may begin a new epoch between the Basques and the State. We\'ve been on behalf of the government since the first day. In this law we have advanced on the road to normalize political relations, and have established important institutions of agreement. The co-worker has been the indispensable instrument of building the future, both among the institutions and the politics, and should remain so. Our organizations will have to establish economic recovery through budgets, positive and cohesion of work. This is the means to continue to penetrate into private public contracts, which are indispensable to strengthen growth, and to ensure the conditions of the social condition of well-being. We have to work together. Today we look at the future with more confidence and hope. Yes, we are engaged to give three axes in the government program, the management field; to be strict in handling and fulfilling the principles of stability; to guarantee basic services (succession, health, and social protection); to restore economy and to create employments. In December 2012, I observed that the crisis was going to be very severe first and foremost. I also foretold in this second stage, that 2015 and 2016 years, the crisis might begin. We have undertaken this end, but we cannot deny that there will be difficulties and difficulties. The most important thing right now is how and how we\'re going to get out of the crisis. Looking at the future, we need a country strategy, and it\'s absolutely necessary that all the teams join that strategy. We share the strategy with which human development is bearable, placed in the four columns of Europe 20. human development, economic growth, intelligent growth and bearable growth. This is where you\'re going. Our North is a strategy of human development and inclusiveness, which places commitment to people on the frontline of government action. Health, education, social policies, equality, culture and security are the cornerstones of our human development. A growth strategy based on industry, modernization of infrastructure, internationalization, support for economic sectors and small and medium-sized enterprises. Growth oriented towards the generation of quality employment. Smart growth based on innovation, economic specialization, technological development and basic research of excellence. A financially and environmentally sustainable strategy. This is the strategy for all departments. Allow me below a summary of its main initiatives under the governance programme. Transparency and good governance. Essential values for the proper functioning of the Administration and to generate confidence in the citizenry. In an unprecedented experience in our environment, we have an ethical commission that has issued thirty-four resolutions in response to consultations by senior government officials and complaints from third parties. All of them are posted on the web. The Basque Government is an administration backed at the highest level by Transparency International. We are committed to observing the provisions of the State Transparency and Good Government Act. Before the end of the year, we will refer to this Parliament the draft law on transparency and citizen participation, as well as the law on the organisation and functioning of the Basque public sector. Both texts are drafted taking into account the contributions of the House groups. In institutional policy we work to reach the maximum consensus in municipal law. The project was referred to the House a year ago, and has entered the last phase of processing. The aim is to strengthen Basque municipalism, giving it the highest level of autonomy and institutional strength. The municipal law includes the creation of the Basque Public Policy Council. This forum is an opportunity to articulate public services, clarify competencies, coordinate policies and improve efficiency. We have referred to Parliament the Law on the Management of the Legal Service and the Law on Foundations. In a few months we will be forwarding the Public Employment Bill, once the new Public Service Council issues its report. Within the framework of the Public Innovation Plan, the Aurrerabide model of advanced management places us in the foreground of the single window. This year we will sign the interoperability agreements with the outside parliaments to share the databases. In Justice, our commitment is to advance the modernization and efficiency of this public service in Basque. We have launched the new judicial offices of Vitoria-Gasteiz and Barakaldo; the next step will be the judicial office of Donostia-San Sebastián. With regard to free legal aid, we work with professional colleges to adjust the applicable rule and improve the service so that people without resources can access justice. I highlight the momentum of restorative justice and the promotion of collaborative law. The Youth Justice Plan, which we have just approved, incorporates the suggested improvements, and its success will be based on the educational function. We also remain involved in open government policies through Irekia. We encourage the participation and co-design of public policies. As a demonstration of this commitment, Irekia in participation, and Emakunde in equality, have received this year\'s recognition from the United Nations. I am now focusing on competitiveness and economic development. In the years 2012 and 2013 all economic indicators were of negative sign; the year 2015 has meant the change of sign. In the second quarter of this year, gross domestic product grew by 2.7%, the industrial output index by 3.2%, and business confidence grew by 2.1 percentage points. The trend is for growth. Moderate, but growth. We are cautious, we assume the responsibility of favouring the positive turn in the Basque industrial sector. Our bet is the digitization of the industry, the Basque Industry 4.0 project. We bet on specialisation in the energy, advanced manufacturing and bioscience-health sectors, in the European line RIS3. The Internationalization Consortium is working to open up new markets, with priorities in Europe, the United States and emerging countries. We maintain support for the strategy of internationalization of companies. We have supported 1,838 initiatives over the past year; the Global Lehian programme has responded to 357 actions; we have supported seven new productive deployments abroad; we have supported 400 initiatives of sectoral associations and clusters; 400 companies have participated in the twenty trade missions with chambers of commerce; we have supported 500 diagnoses and plans for diversifying trade destinations. These data support the dynamism and effort of Basque companies. And we also work through Invest in Basque Country to attract foreign investment, and these are the results: in 2014, five companies with 49 million investments, 480 jobs created or maintained; in 2015, in what we carry out in 2015, there are already ten new initiatives insured, an investment of 87 million, and 720 jobs. We strengthen collaboration with entrepreneurs and support for Basque start-ups. We will strengthen Spri\'s external network and create two new programmes to support internationalisation: Interlehian, and Landhome. Technology is a country bet, and we are going to launch the new Euskadi 2020 digital agenda. We are generating an economic future, an industrial future. We can see that he\'s professionalizing the first sector. In this country, the work which this legislature has done is remarkable, for it will admit the law of the state of peasant women; it is a precursor project. Youthin\'s program has been very good results to give the young people a chance to get into the sector. We\'re creating our own brands for fishing and agriculture. We\'ve created local fishing action group, and in the next few months the operating fishing program will start to start at 20. Thanks to touristism, economics, and Basque Countrymark, they\'re strengthening. We have high-quality tourism. Number of foreign visitors has gone up 13%. It makes 6% of the raw product, and this year it\'s 10 percent raised. Turism helps our merchant. We reinforce this sector and value it, encouraged by a special euscal trade. We believe in companies, the example of the competitive Basque Company and of the value. We\'re on behalf of the public business strategy. We\'re sponsoring innovation programs in the subordinates. We\'re trying to get the workers to share more in the corporate decisions and capital. In order to improve competitiveness and funding initiatives, we also protect them. We\'re sponsoring programmes for support of families and programmes from generation to generation, and alliances between companies. It is the basis of our progress to help those who create companies and wealth, for they are indispensable to support our system of well-being. In fact, one of the essential elements of all this is to help to guarantee social shock. In accordance with our motto ""person"" we confirm that our priority has been a guarantee of social policy. This year we have a deal with our social service wallet. It\'s not enough, but we\'re working with all the organizations to challenge double. the strategic work, and the map of social services, to be fully extended through a financial company tool. With great effort, we have given the priority of rent to secure incomes along with the programmes to face poverty. I must confess that all institutions have done a great deal of work, as well as the entities of the third sector. To ensure these policies, strictness and control are very important. We must remain in a position to know the deserts and strengthen the trust in society. We have to improve the management of the profession, I admit, that\'s what we\'re doing. The profession ought to distinguish two parts: On the one hand the attention which is paid to the management and laboring officers of the country, and to the special management and collective subsidies of the revenue, that is to say, to widows and pensioners. We must continue to improve our organization, and thus he has just accepted the first list of jobs. We know that employment of quality is the principal source of dignity and cohesion of society. I repeat: We\'re working hard on work. The unemployment is going down, that\'s true, but there are still 145,000 people registered in the profession. Our priority is to answer all of us. In order to accomplish this purpose, two years ago, we accepted the plan for the Economic and Ecomomic Suspertius, the Socilist Party of the Basque Party and the Espertalia. The entire plan will be a total of 6.475 million euros, with budget resources and abals inside, which are always economicizing and producing 32,000 jobs. We\'re starting to see the first results of this plan. In two years, we\'re gonna mobilize $4,300 million in a number of programmes, which enables us to activate jobs and create 32,800 jobs. We have the challenge of facilitating the integration of young people and people over the age of 45. A reference example is the local and regional employment plans. I also highlight the agreement between all the institutions to promote entrepreneurship and support the creation of new businesses. With regard to public housing policy, I would like to begin by highlighting the entry into force of the Housing Act in the morning. Its launch could be conditional on the decision of the Spanish Government on the filing of an appeal for unconstitutionality. We do not accept this resource, because it is up to this Parliament to decide on the design of the policies necessary for our country. The Basque Government is adapting its policy to the new determinations of the law. In addition, we are promoting the two strategic axes of the master plan: facilitating access to rented housing, and a new model of urban rehabilitation and regeneration, prioritizing improvements in accessibility and energy efficiency. Examples of these activities are the rental of 314 housing units in Zabalgana, or the comprehensive rehabilitation project of the Coronación de Vitoria-Gasteiz neighbourhood, which the European Union has just confirmed. I conclude this paragraph with a reference to family policy. Euskadi is one of the oldest societies in our environment, and has a serious problem in the population replacement rate. Our commitment is to bring a new strategy for supporting families and investing in children to the institutions as a whole. We share the need to promote measures that will enable families to have the children they want, which do not have to be limited to those they can, conditioned by their economic situation. I then turn to the management of finance and public finances. Economic rigour and improved efficiency in the administration have been two working principles of this Government, which began the legislature with the reduction of its own structure. We continue to take steps towards a more rational and efficient public sector. The new institutional reality offers us an opportunity to address public resizing from a collaborative perspective. I recognize that this is a permanent challenge for our Government, in which we must continue to move forward and improve. We are committed to fiscal consolidation and disciplined deficit control policies. We have achieved economic, fiscal and budgetary stability; we have also reached an agreement with financial institutions to meet the financing needs of companies. Agreements have been reached with outlaws to develop economic recovery actions and investment projects. In the field of taxation, comprehensive reform has been promoted in the Basque Country. We have reached an agreement with the Spanish Government to incorporate new taxes into the Concert system, and the first joint plan to combat tax fraud in the Basque Country is under way. We have agreed on deficit limits until 2017, and the Basque Government maintains the objective of fiscal consolidation on the horizon of achieving a scenario of fiscal stability in 2018. It\'s not enough. We need to continue to optimize our resources. Economic recovery is incipient, and is subject to risk. We know that we come from a deep crisis in which not all needs (not all needs) have been met optimally, a crisis that we have not yet overcome. Rigor in management and prioritization is essential. We will continue to work to maintain public services, social policies and economic recovery projects. That is, an exercise in political commitment from realism. I highlight the Government\'s legislative effort to establish the economic and financial pillars, with rules such as the Basque Statistical Plan Act (approved), the draft law on savings banks and bank foundations (remitted to this House), the regulation of the grant scheme of the Autonomous Community (draft law to be adopted in a few months). I then focus on education, essential public service and guaranteeing a society with capabilities, values and future. Our signs of identity are consensus, stability and equity. The search for agreement and the defence of self-government have been a constant in our educational policy. Important decisions have been preceded by processes of participation; thus, we are making progress in the development of the Heziberri 2020 plan, we have an educational-pedagogical model that emphasizes that the student acquires the necessary skills for life (to learn to be, to live, to communicate or to have initiative), in addition to acquiring skills such as science, technology, linguistics, mathematics, social, artistic or motor. This model is reflected in the curriculum decrees of the different stages of education, whose processing is very advanced. For the first time all educational, social and political actors have had the opportunity to participate in the elaboration of a curriculum decree that is the responsibility of the Basque Government. This is the starting point for starting work leading up to a Basque education law. In the field of vocational training, Euskadi has a long tradition of change and adaptation to the needs of enterprises. I highlight the following achievements: promotion of dual vocational training and implementation of individualised programmes for each enterprise; innovation projects implemented with small and medium-sized enterprises; entrepreneurship training for 10,000 pupils; creation of this course of 85 enterprises through vocational training centres; internationalisation projects with 25 countries; and collaboration with the Lehen Aukera programme. This development of vocational training is reinforced by the commitment to higher education and university research: we promote the university\'s own role in research, scientific and technological improvement (we have approved the University Plan); we are committed to the recovery and attraction of talent and the creation of opportunities for those who feel attracted by our research and knowledge centres; we support the country\'s research capacity through the strategic work of the Ikerbasque Foundation and the BERC network of centres. This Government is making a bet on linguistic coexistence. We have approved the Euskera Strategic Agenda. The Euskara\'s governmental language is a promoter and permanent policy by the Euscara\'s Stratal Age. The presence of the Basque Man, and the strength of his forces, plan new challenges. Society has changed, it is more eloquent, it has changed the sozygic environment. All this makes it possible that the greatest challenge of euphora should be used. In this sense, the use of Euscary for the Fifth Planet, the fundamental curriculum of the adult euphort, composed according to the frame of Europe, and a great multitude of compacts and contributions. Equal opportunities for the use of the two official languages and linguistic freedom must be effective. We advance thanks to the involvement and attitude of citizens in favour of the Basque people, the commitment of the public authorities, the use of self-government in favour of the Basque people, consensus, public-private collaboration, the effort of many people, the attitude of thousands and thousands of Basquesun berris. All this has placed the euskera on the path of sustained growth. Such sustained growth needs to be sustainable. We will continue to move towards greater linguistic equality and better coexistence. Next, I shall speak of the doctrine strategy, which renders us universal euphoria, which strengthens our personality, from a constant creation. We combine these three aspects: To help the production fund, to escape undergrowth, and to encourage the culture industry. It\'s about how the Digital Age options go deep. I particularly mean Donostia 2016, which is the project of European Cultura Capital, and we must consider it a challenge in all the capitals. \'Tis a responsibility to all of us to transmigrate Euskadi\'s image in Europe, and it is a chance to make us know ourselves among the nations. In addition to this, Guggenheim Bilbao\'s Museum has been restored to life after renewing the organizational ceremony, it is more attractive in the nation and has torn all the marks into the number of visitors. We have deployed the international site of contemporary culture, the center of Tabakal, of art and culture. On the other hand, I want to highlight Dantzerti, the top-level center of dramatic art and dance that started this week. With these drivers, we must establish our system of culture with the network of public libraries. Public libraries are connected to a single network, and the library, thanks to the project, will be plunged into a digital period. The fundamental column of an advanced society is to guarantee security. Without certainty the quality of life decreases, and the confidence which strengthens economic activity is lost. The work of thousands of men and women working on every side of security in the Public Security Plan has been collected. Euskadi is a very secure people now, for in recent years the rates of crimes and falseties are being lowered. Euskadi is a reasonably safe country today, crime and misconduct rates are falling. Today there are more ertzainas working on the street, their presence is evidence, with more than two hundred simultaneous patrols with illuminated blue bridges, a network of twenty-five police stations, more than forty points of citizen attention, or the permanent service of traffic patrols. I recognize that in road safety we will have to strengthen our policies, social awareness and inter-agency collaboration. This legislature has begun the development of a new police model in the Ertzaintza that recovers its founding spirit with the accumulated experience of more than thirty years, liberated from the terrorist threat of ETA and aimed at the constant renewal of police intelligence. We have been committed to modernizing the organization, lightening its structure, and implementing effective and efficient management. The Ertzaintza is strengthened by generational renewal. Last week, the 121 students of the twenty-fourth promotion joined us, and we will do our utmost to prevent the Ministry of Finance\'s appeal against the call for the twenty-fifth promotion. We will continue to work to incorporate into the Arkaute Academy the 250 people already selected before the end of the year. And I announce that in 2016 we will call for a new promotion to ensure the maintenance of an Ertzaintza composed of 8,000 agents. It is unacceptable for the Government of Spain to attempt to limit the capacity to incorporate new agents, when this Parliament has committed itself to the 8,000-ertzaina staff. On the other hand, we have launched the preventive security plan in the face of the threat of radical Islamism in Europe. We do so in close cooperation with the Islamic communities of Euskadi, who are also concerned about this situation. We continue to improve collaboration with municipalities, firefighting services, civil protection groups and public and private security agencies. This collaboration is with the rest of the security forces, but is particularly relevant with the local police. I stress the need for joint work in the judicial sphere, or with the judicial sphere and other police bodies. We will continue to call for greater direct participation in the areas of international police coordination. I want to talk about domestic and gender-based violence. It is a priority not only for Ertzaintza: it is an unacceptable focus of violence, which we must combat by promoting equality through Emakunde\'s policies. Violence against women is a structural problem, the most brutal expression of inequality. It needs a multidimensional response, working on the effects of violence against women and its causes. We are working to overcome the structural problem of inequality and continue to advance in a society in which women and men have equal rights. Equality policies, coordinated by Emakunde, affect all areas (education, health, economy, employment, social services, security or urban planning). A reference example is the work with the advertising and media sector to establish a code of ethics and self-regulation for non-sexist advertising and communication. I refer below to health policies. This is a public service and universal priority for the Basque Government. Euskadi is the community that invests the most in this service, 1,568 euros per person, a figure above the European average. Money well invested, because Euskadi has been located for the first time as the community that best health services offer to citizens. We have launched the Health Plan 2020, approved and evaluated by this Parliament. We have completed and developed programs such as breast cancer screening, colorectal cancer or metabolopathies, also prevention projects in relation to minors and alcohol consumption, or the addiction bill. Euskadi has one of the most complete and modern vaccine calendars in Europe. The last addition was the pneumococcal vaccine on July 1. We\'re still improving the equipment. In the last twelve months investments have been made in the health centres of Mungia, Alonsotegi and Zestoa; magnetic resonance units of Zumarraga and Donostia; isolation unit of infectious diseases of Donostialdea; external consultation building of Goierri-Alto Urola, or emergency observation area of Bidasoa. The work of the Urduliz and Eibar Hospital is also being carried out, and the plan for the expansion of the Arab University Hospital has been initiated. The Government is aware of the challenges we face in maintaining the quality of this service, due to the progressive ageing of the population, associated with the increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases. Osakidetza is being prepared by integrating primary care services with hospitals through the creation of integrated health organizations (IHOs), and also works in a more coordinated way with social services. We have launched a public job offer of 1,014 jobs. Giving maximum stability to employment in Osakidetza is a priority; its professionals are our main asset. We made a huge investment in new technologies: the implementation of the electronic recipe has been a milestone, with the processing of more than 50 million recipes. Another milestone is the plan to improve telephone care, both in advance appointment and in medical care, with more than 2 million consultations this year. We have taken a decisive step in transparency and information to the patient. The Osakidetza health folder provides each patient with access to clinical documentation and waiting lists. Health care is growing in Basque, we have more professionals with an accredited linguistic profile. We advance in the choice of the language of care or bilingual clinical history. We are making a stake in the generation of value and economic opportunities, and one of the three areas of smart specialization in Euskadi is health biosciences. The health research and innovation strategy has projects such as Biodonostia or Biocruces, already accredited as a health research institute and whose works are already in progress. I now turn to environmental policy and territorial development. In this area, Euskadi makes a huge investment effort for the modernisation of the transport and mobility network, especially railways. In Bilbao we are in the final phase of metro line 3, fundamental for the connection of Otxarkoaga, Txurdinaga, Zurbaran or Matiko. We also advanced in the definitive design of the Old Helmet station. In Donostia this year the construction of the Loiola-Herrera station begins, and the design of the Herrera-Altza connection, which will be tendered at the end of next year, is completed. We also advance in the railway variant of Eibar, which will enter into service in a few months. In Vitoria-Gasteiz, in collaboration with the city council, we bet on integrated mobility, the extension of the tram to the south and the incorporation of the neighborhoods of Salburua and Zabalgana into the multimodal scheme. We are improving the Basque railway network: suppression of the crossing at the level and new station of Urduliz, suppression of the passage at the level of Mendizur in Bedia, improvement of the station of Hendaia, and steps at the level of Pradera in Zaratamo and Santa Clara in Zarautz. We have achieved the European Union\'s investment commitment to the high-speed train, and we maintain the 2019 horizon committed by the Spanish Government. This week we have led the arrival to the capitals. On the other hand, the future of airports is essential. I\'d like to highlight the request and commitment we\'ve made for being 24 hours operational. We\'re improving the logistics of the Basque ports and we\'re trying to integrate with Junkis and Arasur Plataforms. The logistic system is indispensable to manufactures and also to attract commercial activity. We\'re on the way to the integrated transport system and we\'re going to get a single card in public transport. I repeat, that in this part of the legislature it is necessary to assume the jurisdictions derived from the Basques in the field of transportation. Let us remember that we had been on the point of signing an agreement with the former Spanish Government about the transfers of the train. But with the current government, nothing has been advanced, and they have no interest in advancing. Now I\'m talking about protecting the environment and the anti-violence change. Our environmental policy is strictly based on the protection of resources, which are always compatible with economic activity and activity. This year, we\'ve accepted the Euscal Plan in the opposite part of the climate change. Eukadin has to be reviewed the environmental law, and in this review we\'ll have to watch the environment and develop the green economy without ever forgetting our experience of treatment of the debris or washing the soil. The artifacts for the organization of the country were adopted in the year 1997, and we are now showing them. The time for planning the country layout and the future challenges. Let us now consider the subject of external intercourse. Euskadi\'s future is inserted into a global environment. We\'ll improve our organization\'s relations between the nations. Since my American president, we have made meetings with Ambassadors 146 of 82 countries. With this we take part in the councils of the European ministers, open to the autonomy community, and also in the works of the Ecofin. Our presence is important, but it\'s not enough. We have completed the 2020 strategic plan of the Eurogreion. We\'re just trying to figure out what proposal we\'re going to propose to the Junker plan in order to fund development and development projects. It is in this circle that the challenge to make a match for Navarro, who already participates in the Pyrenian Labour Society. I\'d like to announce an important event. The Basque Council will be here on the 7th of Gallivity, Gasteo, October 7th. Euscalic community will be the greatest sign of force in the world. He\'ll be able to work closer and closer thanks to Basque Global Network Prize. In this international area, the humanist crisis that we are living in Europe has confirmed our origin based on the policy of co-workers. I must confess that, due to the economic crisis, our power has been reduced, but our vocation cannot be doubted. The greatest effort in our co-operation has been made in our own Autonomy. We train 40 million to make investments. Next month we\'ll introduce a new humanitarian emergency package and share 2 million euros, especially in Syria, but in other places where there\'s a crisis. So far, in the first part, I\'ve introduced you to the most important initiative that has taken place in the Eucomun action. I\'ll hit the second part. A new push for Basques. We collected 625 initiatives and 14 strategic plans in the government program. All these resolutions and plans are our commitment, our promise to obey: the commitment to strengthen the economy, and to create employment, the commitment to the person who aims at it, to strengthen peace and co-operation, and to fix the foundations of the new political state of the future. We work on a new impulse for Euskadi on our three axes of action. I start with economic recovery and employment. The challenge is to continue building an economic future, that is, human development and sustainable growth; a development that supports economic recovery and quality employment and ensures solidarity. This boost requires continuing with the modernization of the territory, culminating investments in public transport, sanitary equipment, education and university; further progress in technological development. We are not going to take a step backwards in the welfare social state that we have managed to consolidate even in the toughest years of the crisis. This new impetus is underpinned by three strategic priorities: innovation, employment, and the Basque Country strategy. The first pillar is innovation. A competitive and balanced economy is built on the basis of innovation. We have addressed the reorganization of the R & D & i system with greater public-private consultation, and strengthened the evaluation and efficiency criteria and the implementation of an intelligent specialization strategy. In this year we have increased investment in technological innovation. I recognize that we need to recover investment even further, and this is the commitment made by the Science, Technology and Innovation Council last week. The Council has positively assessed the deployment of the RIS3 Smart Specialisation Strategy, and we have decided that it is time to regain momentum to place Euskadi at the forefront of innovation in Europe. We are aware of this need, because we are laying the foundations for the fourth industrial revolution in Euskadi, with advanced manufacturing. This year we have launched three new programs, with 5.2 million, for companies and industries that are advancing in digitisation. We will promote scientific and university research of excellence. We have strategic research projects related to energy. We will collide with Scotland, in the Vanguard network, a European marine renewable energy project to be developed in hostile environments. We have signed a partnership agreement for the development of local suppliers and the promotion of technological opportunities in the field of oil and gas. We work with the private sector to launch gas-powered projects in maritime transport. We participate in bio-health research. And this is not an exclusive task of the Government: it belongs to all institutions, universities and research centres of excellence, technological centres, companies and society. The Government will make the added effort it needs, and double the budget growth rate envisaged in the Science, Technology and Innovation Plan for 2016. The second pillar, our key priority, is employment, especially youth employment. Retrieving employment is our central goal. We\'re better than in December 2012, when we started the legislature. We have made progress, although it is not enough. I announce that next year\'s budget will boost employment plans, with particular attention to the youth group and the long-term unemployed. I am moving forward with a commitment to increase the Lehen Aukera programme budget by 50%, in order to promote the first work experience through the encouragement of work contracts in practice. We will also increase care and training programmes linked to the recruitment of long-term unemployed. The third pillar of the new momentum is the Basque Country strategy. The future of Euskadi depends on our ability to have our own space and role in the global world. A shared vision of Basque Country is needed, based on public-private collaboration. The opportunities are within reach of our hand: Euskal Hiria, with Basque capitals cooperating and united by the high-speed train; the integration of ports, airports, logistics platforms and transport networks, in a combined logistics and connectivity; Basque strategy against climate change and for sustainability; bet on Basque Industry 4.0 technology and the Basque digital agenda; smart specialization; internationalisation of our universities; academic adaptation to the European environment and training programmes abroad; boost to the Euroregion in the European Atlantic arc, with the announced incorporation of Navarra; Donostia European Cultural Capital 2016, and projection of our cultural institutions. Euskadi Basque Country is a country of ethics, a country of hospitality and co-workers, a country of social consciousness. This country offers the offer of its culture and of the best personality. In like manner, Euskadi Basque Country equality, solidarity, and participation, is to promote the values, as they are peculiar to the euscal society. So, we work on this new impulse, and it\'s the new innovation, employment, and the Balsque Country strategy of that impulse. Now I\'ll speak of the engagement to strengthen peace and fellowship. First, I\'ll tell you a strong conviction. The Basque Society hopes that organized end of violence and we will be able to help to obtain the new principle of association as soon as possible. I grant that differences between parties have increased, and that they have not contributed to block the Peace and Company Committee, and that they have neutralized the chance of forming indirect political agreements. But I\'d like to confirm that we\'re still working on this area. The Basque Society demands that the weapons be left behind and that they may disappear. Political agents and institutions require an end of violence. As for the organized end of violence, it is locked around three parties; the disarming, the prisoner, and the critical thought of the past. We ask that a process of disarming and a final disappearance may be given to you in an unhinged, unconditional, unconditioned manner, fully and distinctly proved. \'EuskMingon 21th December, 2014, announced a proposal about unarmation and an organized end. This path must be made with discretion, in accordance with engagements, without any strategy or partial interest in taking up the deadlines. As far as the politics of prison are concerned, based on laws and human principles, we are working for penal normal and prison abnormality, re-educated to society and partnership. We\'ll go on asking the patriot to his left. let the collective veto, which forbids prisoners to take advantage of individual prison bonds, and to pass over by legal means of resociation. We shall present a new proposition of the policy of punishment and prisons based on the New Spanish Government based on the Direct Road and the Talker\'s programmes. As for critical reflection, we are proposing a pedagogia of self-criticity within the limits of human rights. On October 30th and 31st, with Donostia 2016 initiative, he\'s directed the first project based on the proposal. Within the scope of this performance, prisoners on the way Nanclares will present a project made within the experience of the word program. In addition to the organized end of violence, we need also the new principle of partnership. The planet of peace and co-existence itself is intended to unite society, that is the end of our work. The axes of our action are collected in four different areas; the victims, the enlightenment, the memory, and the culture of the community. We\'ll continue with the public policies of victims, and we\'ll continue to promote certain programs such as Adian, the portraits, coming and building. We will develop compromise together, so that the beauty of the victims will look into the future and promote the connection between the victims and society. In addition to this, we shall present in the autumn a proposal of consenting to the law of the law to which human rights have been violated. To set up the high school of memory, co-existence, and human rights is one of the axes of this legislation. The policy of memory which integrates society will encourage them, as well as politics which always renounce violence, and which are founded on the engagement of human rights, and on the end of their co-operation. We will encourage co-workers, driven by the intervention of society itself. We will support the enterprises which have been started with these: With associations, with educationmakers, with the Council of Castile, with EITB, with Eestal University, with the Peace Programs, and the Human Rights of the United Nations. We shall allow the members of society, as an effective means of association, to obtain peace and co-operation. And we have been engaged to work for it, according to a great idea: society society. I maintain the personal conviction that society expects us to contribute as soon as possible and in the best way possible to the definitive end of violence and a renewing principle of coexistence. The extreme weakening of ETA is a positive fact. Today, the final end of ETA remains necessary, an end that secures its total disarmament and complete disappearance. Basque society demands that ETA be dissolved, and it also demands recognition of the unjust damage caused, something as simple as saying that killing was wrong, that violating human rights was wrong. This is our commitment. In the area of peace and coexistence, the Government\'s commitment will continue to be the social meeting. This commitment involves intervening with concrete proposals, seeking consensus in all institutional and political directions. We are not going to stand still; we are going to take the initiative, and take risks to promote unlocking. We will continue to act with the public policies of victims. As we advance in the meetings on 4 and 5 June, we will develop the Batera commitment, so that victim policies also look to the future and promote the union between victims and society. The Basque Government will continue to demand from ETA a process of definitive, irreversible, unconditional, complete and verifiable disarmament and disappearance. We will present to the new Spanish Government a proposal to recover, from legal and humanitarian principles, the state of penal and prison normality, oriented towards reintegration and coexistence, based on the documents Zuzen Bidean and Hitzeman. We call on those on the abertzale left to lift the collective veto that prevents prisoners from opting for individual prison benefits and going through the legal channels of reintegration and resocialization. We will continue to propose and promote a pedagogy of self-criticism in human rights, as a model of political and constructive management of the past. The launch of the Institute of Memory, Co-existence and Human Rights will be one of the pillars of the end of the legislature. This autumn we will put forward a proposal to reach a consensus on a law on the recognition of victims of unrecognized human rights violations. After the general elections, the Basque Government will prepare the proposal for a basic agreement for coexistence. It will be inspired by the ethical soil, and will be presented as a tool to create a shared space for coexistence in the medium term. We have a clear objective: to make social encounter possible. Thirdly, I address the commitment to lay the groundwork for a new political status for Euskadi. My commitment, as reflected in the government programme, was to propose the creation of a parliamentary paper for the groups to assess Basque self-government and from the maximum possible consensus to lay the foundations for its future development. The presentation was made on 27 March 2014. I would like to record two issues relating to the work carried out within it. The debate takes place in the institution that best reflects the plurality of citizenship to which our self-government owes itself, and it has been attended by all groups. And we have been able to listen and listen with respect, despite our differences and the different political projects we represent. I defend the need to place the debate of the future within the presentation, as we continue to show the tendency to put our proposals and initiatives outside this area. The cabinet that I chair has indeed made available to the paper all the reports that have been required of it; they will serve to enrich the debate and focus the final phase of its task. The positions expressed by the different political groups do not yet offer the members to materialise a common proposal. It is clear, however, that we mostly share the recognition that the institutions of which our community was endowed, with the Gernika Statute, have contributed to improving our common life and well-being; we assume that the Statute is not being complied with; we share the uniqueness that recognizes the system of economic concertation, in whose defence we almost unanimously agree, and we feel the need to update self-government and adapt it to the new reality of the Europe to which we belong. I have been and am respectful of the work of the paper. I honestly believe that, when Parliament advocates for itself the knowledge of a matter as relevant as the organization of future coexistence, the Government should focus on providing the House with the support it may require. So I have done for the last year and a half, in strict consequence with my convictions. My convictions remain. In fact, in two weeks\' time the anniversary of the first Basque Government will be celebrated, and we make our own the aspiration of the lehendakari Aguirre, in search of the agreement to give way to what he said, the desire for national freedom of Euskadi. My political approaches and aspirations, my ideas about Euskadi and their right to self-government are, as could not be otherwise, part of the acquis of political formation to which I belong. Four years ago, 135 of the Constitution. there was a dispute about the reform of the article at the Courts. When the road of reform was opened, the Jestric Party, who was the President, introduced a correction. In this correction it was summed up what the party intends to self-organize, whether it be the right of self-determination by the citizens of the Basques, to assume that their political, economic, social, and culture is a free and democratic power of deciding whether the sovereignty is shared by other nations. Today I\'m being part of this Euscadian parliament as president, and I represent all of the sensibilities of our country. As for the auto-generacy, at the time of designing the future, I defend myself from agreeing and based upon an integrated arrangement, the basis of that future being concluded and comprehended. I repeat, the conclusion of the following sequence: Conversation, negotiation, agreement, confirmation. I accept the diversity of society, and commit to respect it. This commitment means that neither the postulates of one side nor the postulates of the other side should be imposed upon by one, nor by mine alone. By agreement and agreement we shall obtain a more just and democratic society. The negotiation and agreement are the indispensable elements of my proposal. The solution of this agreement must always confirm the majority of the Basque communities, as an expression of the free and democratic determination of political future. I should like to remind you, that every treaty is founded on two pillars: in mutual approbation and partiality. If we don\'t agree on both sides, there\'s no treaty. Progress means denying one-sidedness. The one-sidedness invalidates the gathering of will. The future of Basque self-government goes through the recovery of the spirit of the pact, mutual recognition and bilaterality. Aiming for a new future does not mean ignoring the self-government achieved. We cannot disregard the achievements of those who preceded us in the construction of this Euskadi. Self-government has opened the door to the institutionalization of Euskadi. Its exercise has enabled us to achieve the highest levels of well-being, quality of life and institutional confidence in our history. I affirm that the Basque self-government must be evaluated and reformulated, not as a new building to be erected in the air and without attachment to the existing framework, but from the reality of what has been built over the past thirty-five years. The Basque self-government must be supported, extending the powers already recognized, adapting to the European reality, and widening the limits of institutional and social construction already consolidated. Given this reality, we cannot ignore the shortcomings of statutory development, which are reflected in the lack of completion of the transfer process and its degradation. The Statute of Gernika, an updated expression of historical rights, was conceived by Basque society as our own Constitution. In recent years, there has been a deterioration in the nature of the Statute. We are suffering a practical degradation of the capacity and legal and symbolic rank of Basque self-government, caused by invasive legislation and jurisprudence, which devalue their real capacity. The current framework does not respect the inspiring spirit of the 1979 Statute, which established the principles of subject, bilaterality, covenant and guarantees. It has not been possible to agree and create the instruments that guarantee the full development of the Statute; nor to ensure the guarantees of compliance that preserve its agreed nature. As lehendakari, I have to appeal, even to demand from the State and the governments of the State, to recover the spirit and content with which we work, to agree and to society ratified the Statute of Gernika, conceived as our Constitution. We have suffered a mutation in the statutory covenant; a new convention is needed. It is essential to recognize the multi-national reality of the State and to re-govern the self-government of Euskadi to the desired rank of Basque citizenship. The uniqueness of Euskadi is based on the legal, even legal-constitutional, entanglement that protects and respects our historical rights, original freedoms preserved by pact. I have been and still am in favour of making the most of this legal singularity. I am convinced that in this way we can move towards greater self-government and develop economic, social and cultural policies that will enable us to face our future with guarantees within the framework of a Europe under construction. In this way we can find effective areas of coincidence and confluence with Navarra, to the extent that it allows us to share, in the foral environment, the same tradition and vocation of self-government. I am convinced that we have the capacity to reach a new pact from mutual recognition and effective bilaterality. I believe in union from democratic will and free accession; I do not believe in unity from imposition and unilaterality. As a foreign nation that we are, our historic rights, protected and respected, can give them as much as they can reach our capacity to achieve institutional pacts, to make political decisions that are endorsed by citizens and respected. In this way we can find the way forward in self-government, achieve recognition as a nation and continue to build Euskadi in a stronger and more open Europe. I respect the work of the paper, and I trust its results. Our starting point as representatives of the Basque people is the Statute of Gernika in its entirety, including its additional provision, as endorsed by Basque citizens. This starting point is a basic democratic requirement. The whole Basque citizenship endorsed the pact, so its modification must go through a new social endorsement. I have shared with you my vision and conviction that the moment demands commitment, responsibility and height of sight. Our great political challenge is to identify a meeting space for the plurality of political aspirations and feelings of national belonging that are quoted in Basque society. Legebiltzarkideok, ladies and gentlemen, I have started my speech by saying that we are aware of the demands of the moment and of the priority of fulfilling the government program. I am committed to completing the programme and fulfilling the word given to society. It is not my style to make statements of more or less diffuse intentions. I have broken through the projects on which this Government is working, and I conclude with a summary of the main commitments that we are going to implement in the coming months. Before the end of the year, the Government will adopt and forward to the House six new bills in advanced processing: public employment; ports and maritime transport; organization and operation of the Basque public sector; documents and archives; transparency, citizen participation and good governance; and vocational training. Four public offers of employment, with 1,700 new places: public offer of employment of Osakidetza, with 1,014 places; the twenty-fifth promotion of Ertzaintza, with 250 new places; public offer of Education with 275 places, and 175 places that will be consolidated in the Administration of Justice. In addition, we have completed the consolidation of Lanbide\'s new structural staff, with 918 positions, which represents 104 new positions; we have committed the public offer of Employment of Osakidetza for the first quarter of 2016, which will reach 1,500 positions, and we are working on a public offer of employment in Education. We advanced in infrastructures for the modernization of Euskadi: new judicial office of Donostia, and judicial infrastructure in Bilbao destined to the Prosecutor\'s Office of Bizkaia; effective implementation of the Antzerti-School of Dramatic Art and Dance of Euskadi, after its inauguration yesterday; Mariturri education centre in Vitoria-Gasteiz; completion of line 3 of the metro of Bilbao; progress in the network of the metro of Donostialdea with the entry into service of the Herrera-Altza and Lugaritz-Easo sections, new Loyola station and also the railway variant of Eibar; start the recovery work of the Pasaia Bay in implementation of the inter-institutional agreement; port integration with the logistic platforms of Jundiz and Arasur; open the new hospital of Urduliz and promote the new hospital of Eibar; open the health centers of Zestoa, Santutxu, Miribilla and Kanpezu. Relevant initiatives for progress in our country: to develop the new spatial planning guidelines designed under the Euskal Hiria model; to complete the launch of Basque Global Network, a network that will link the entire Basque community in the world; to complement and complete the implementation of the sixth plan for the equality of women and men, a continuous and cross-cutting commitment of the Government; to jointly manage the European Capital of Culture Donostia 2016; to consolidate the ESS Bilbao neutron source project in collaboration with Lund headquarters and the Spanish Government. We\'re starting initiatives which will improve the social quality and the welfare of the community directly. We\'re going to design a project that can only be one ticket to transport. We\'re going to close the integrated grid of health, and that\'s what we\'re going to do. We\'re gonna put Gastei, Aquab, Errisha, and the ESIs at the Uribe Coast. A new decree that will regulate the Doa justice. We\'ll end up completing Oss and Pressets, as far as the integrated pattern of the socionation is concerned for all the dwellings that are above 100 years old. We will accept the strategic plan of social service, forums and municipal unions. In the economy area, we will make decisions that will encourage Eukadin\'s recovery and employment. We\'re going to present Vanguard\'s initiative, he\'s a European research project in the etholical energy area, and we\'re going to introduce the urgent E2025 strategy, and we\'re going to reinforce the project by Bim. We\'re expanding the RIS3 strategy of the mind\'s specialization. Enforce the program to recover the economy and push the job on the left and on the Oarso. We\'ll move forward in the Educational strategy, encourage them with a Professional education, and encourage international innovation and innovation. We will present the development of the cultural industry and manufactures. We do more than these active and commitments, we do our daily work. Examples are examples which indicate an engagement to the word given in the government program. I\'m done. The Basque Government looks to the future with greater confidence and hope. We do not hide the difficulties and uncertainties. They know of our commitment to economic rigour in public policies. We\'re going to consolidate what we\'ve achieved. We will continue to ensure essential public services, social protection and economic recovery and job creation policies. We have to get out of the crisis, and do it together and in the right direction. I am realistic, aware of the difficulties, and I believe in the strength and capacity of Euskadi, of businesses, families and people. The formula will not be different: work, shared effort and collaboration. We will go ahead thanks to the group of administrations that we share public policies; thanks to the political agreements that we have been able to reach, to public-private consultation and to the participation of society; thanks to stability and collaboration; thanks to the work and commitment of all those who are striving and working in the Basque Government (Ertzaintza, Osakidetza, Education, Lanbide and the public service as a whole). My last words are to thank this collective effort and demand that we maintain the spirit of collaboration. Let us continue to work together in companies, families, social groups, public administrations, and also in this Parliament. I am fully aware of the difficulties and needs of the moment. I am fully aware of our responsibility for integration. The future of Euskadi is a collective work; what we achieve will be a shared achievement. With greater confidence and hope we look into the future. I promise that we will endeavour to overcome the challenges, which is our privilege: to get out of crisis, supported by social panic, and fixed the way to the economic future of Eucharadia. We\'ve always known how to advance. This time it will be the same formula: work and cooperation. Let\'s get back to work together because Euskakia\'s future is a collective job. So everything we do will be a shared achievement. That\'s how we see it and we\'ll keep going. Thank you, everyone. [[Applause]]', 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the Galego Nationalist Block, the Socialist Party of Galicia, En Marea and the People\'s Party of Galicia; authorities present in the gallery who honor us with their presence; Greeks and Greeks, by Galicia, because I believe in it and in its future; for Galicia, because there is no greater honor than serving it; and in Galicia, because citizens marked this way by giving me the privilege of being able to aspire to the majority confidence of this House for the third time; motivated, driven and legitimized by the Greeks and the Greeks, that is why I am here. You\'ll understand that, in the most intimate sphere, after three times running as a candidate to preside over Galicia and seeing the citizen\'s support expanded, there\'s a feeling of gratitude and emotion that is very difficult to describe. Let me summarize it by telling you that after all this time, after living from this position successes and flavors of my land, which I have always celebrated and suffered with, I introduce myself to this investment session as a militant from Galicia. But, beyond the staff, the first thing I wanted to express is a feeling that we can all or, at least, we must share: present in the name of all our respect for Galicia, its form of being, its way of thinking and its way of deciding. Ladies and gentlemen, I\'m here after getting the support of young and old, of Welsh people in rural and urban areas, of people who suffer and people who have a more prosperous life, and so do you. Galicia is not divided by age, condition or origin that can be approved by one political force or another. Outside this House there is a free Galicia which has indeed freely chosen the people we are here with and the intensity with which each of the political forces is represented. It is a fully autonomous Galicia, as it points out, without going further, that the election result of September 25th in this Parliament leaves the only absolute majority that exists in an autonomous community in Spain. To be an exception I don\'t think I\'m going to assume, if I get the confidence of the House, no prerogative regarding my autonomic counterparts or the newly invested President of the Government of Spain. I feel myself a part of a historic moment that demands agreements more intensely than ever. In my opinion, what really represents the election result is a temper. A temper that the citizens expressed in the polls forcefully. Mostly, our people don\'t want to read and stability; yes Government soon and no longer delay; yes unity, in Galicia and with the rest of Spain, instead of more division; and instead of agitation, choose, yes, moderation. Galicia has decided to be serene, but consistently its own course and has come to light from the uncertainty that has stopped Spain in recent months. Our duty is to follow your command and your example, and that is why I propose to give you the answers you ask us, starting with this Parliament. Because, ladies and gentlemen, many years after the parents of Galicia made a memorable synthesis of what we are — Galicia, a people, a land, a speech — you would have to add one more element that distinguishes us, groups us and makes us stronger: Galicia, a people, a land, a speech and a Parliament. I remember these records to claim the house that welcomes us all. We inhabit the dreams of our ancestors. It should simply serve to value this institution, even more so when representative democracy suffers from attacks or scorn. There are parliaments that are closed, assaulted or surrounded by those who agree to grant themselves a representative that no one has given them, because the only place where you can get it is in the polls. That\'s why I hope what you\'re defending here is the deal or the disagreement, but never the aggression to this House. Because whoever despises a representative of the people here despises himself, but above all, he is also scorning the people. [[Applause]] Let\'s not go back, ladies and gentlemen, resort to behaviors that don\'t define a society. Ours has nothing to do with incivism and free offense. That\'s not what our ancestors have bound us, it\'s not what our peers generally practice, and that\'s not what they chose in the past autonomous elections. Ladies and gentlemen, Galicia has clearly decided stability and has clearly decided moderation. I\'m not saying it to boast of the election victory of my party, and much less of me as a candidate. He has more support than ever before to the social and political model that the Greeks have been building and renewing for a long time. Because here a model of its own is kept intact, not imported, not copied or imitated. A model in which Galicia recognizes itself and claims in Spain and Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, this model of country, which I defend and which I aspire to represent as President of the Union, part of Galicia\'s pride. That pride is permanent. We feel it when we are supported, as we are now, by most eloquent, but also when we see ourselves deprived, as we haven\'t been so long, of enough support to rule. The big difference with other concepts is that, in view of the adverse results, we don\'t wonder what people were wrong about, but what we were wrong about. We\'re self-critical, and we\'re trying to fix the mistakes that citizens point to us; the same way we know that victories do not exempt us from doing the same. In short, we do not believe that illustrated despotism is a good recipe for Galicia of the 21st century. All for the people listening to the people, adapting to the people and to the people. And, above all, respecting always, always, always his idiosyncrasy and his opinion. Ladies and gentlemen, in view of those who still think that Galicia is an immature, ignorant or alienated society in the hands of some alien force that moves our threads as if it were a puppet, we see with admiration how our people decide for themselves and for themselves. As he decided, just over a month ago, in the midst of a national noise, to impose his particular feelings and sentiño. This people is made up of individuals, with concrete problems and specific concerns. I know that many of them are threatened with their individual freedom because of problems of all kinds. There are Welsh people who suffer from lack of employment or sufficient resources to get rid of their loved ones. There are Welsh women who suffer from the threat of male violence. There are Welsh people who suffer from illness or from the conditions of the countries they emigrated to, as is happening in Venezuela. The people who suffer most — for whatever reason — are our first concern and our main commitment. I speak in plural again, because I know that this statement has the unanimous support of this House. [[Applause]] The desirable thing is that we also try to achieve that alliance not only in the capacity to move ourselves to the pain of our compatriots, but also in the ability to give them answers. That\'s why I\'m proposing to kick them off from the start with a fallacy that, in my view, citizens punished in the polls. The Greeks don\'t demand artificial paradise politics, but seemingly more modest solutions, but they know that they really change the lives of women and men. As a general rule, our people are aware that the future is not a fiction that is fabricated, but a reality that is shared and molded. Starting from this base, ladies and gentlemen, what I propose is to transfer to this Parliament the exception of Galicia\'s election result with a political behaviour that is also exceptional: let\'s work together. We work together to draw out our debate fruitful conclusions, instead of tracing verbal labyrinths that have no way out or, of course, useful to citizens. Counting on the only absolute majority of a community in Spain gives Galicia an indisputable force to face the debates that are about to open in Spain. My determination is to take advantage of it with active participation in all of them, especially with regard to the new model of self-financing, which I will then extend to myself. But I already tell them and I ask them — especially I ask them — that they add up, because the pact between us will make, besides the protagonist, the voice of the Greeks unappealable. Ladies and gentlemen, with the level of uncertainty that currently weighs on politics and on the future of many political parties that also have representation in this House, I believe that citizens have a fairly limited hope of achieving many pacts. I propose that we surprise them from Galicia, or, rather, to imitate them. Because in the same way as citizens who voted differently are able to work together every day, their representatives here should have to do something similar. As I understand it, most must be an inclusive and non-exclusive tool; that is, of course, my disposition. It is to be hoped that minority representatives will share this principle. For my part, I give them the complete conviction that most don\'t grant me any gift of infallibility. I doubt, mistake, and sometimes I think I\'m right. Therefore, I would like the minorities not to feel mortgaged by any oath of systematic opposition making the parliamentary debate a sterile exercise. The support obtained in Galicia by the group I represent is, of course, exceptional. It\'s a unique result in Spain. But my will is that this absolute majority will be an open majority; a majority open to all the Greeks, regardless of what they voted for, because they can be sure that there will be an autonomous government that will work for everyone. And a majority also open to you in this Parliament, regardless of what the Party belongs to, because you will always have my hand to join in the solutions to the great political and social consensus that took place in the polls on September 25. Because, ladies and gentlemen, the new time that opens at the same time as this tenth legislation, now that we are beginning to overcome the crisis and consolidate the recovery — I insist that we begin — brings structural challenges that require generational responses from us and not just partisan responses. Ladies and gentlemen, in the first legislation in which I had the responsibility of the Presidency of the Union, our country was asking to straighten out the past after an erratic stage and to abandon it that they had been consolidating themselves during the autonomous era and that, in some cases, they had harmed us especially. I think, humbly, that we did it with a united government that followed the same route. We shielded the viability of public services and prevented Galicia from being rescued as most autonomous communities. Our task was to order an imperfect priest. The second mandate forced us to order a gift that would test the ability of self-government to overcome a global crisis. I think we\'ve also done it, starting to dedicate resources and boost recovery, and, although not completely, we\'ve achieved it. None of the previous two laws were simple, but, with correctness or error, there has always been a government that has fulfilled its obligations, there has always been a government that has ruled, and to all those who have formed or are part of it I want to thank you for always having responded to that duty at the easiest times and, above all, at the most complex times. [[Applause]] In this third shift there will also be a government that will perform its function, and will do so inspired by a fundamental idea: now Galicia has to conjugate its future. Galicia that we will be, the Greek economy that will be, the Greek society that will be, the role that our autonomous community will play in the state. That\'s what I want to talk to you about. To deal with these axes, which — I insist — I will soon develop more in detail, our land enjoys the necessary strength and stability to forget the question that other more precarious, dependent or clearly intervened communities — or even at national level — are done when they listen to the horizon. The question they ask is, what\'s going to happen? And the question is voiced unhesitatingly. A country like ours, endowed with a coherent majority, a cohesive society and growing economic constants, we wonder not what\'s going to happen, but what we\'re going to do. The answer I want to give to that question is apparently simple, but it has great importance in democracy. The question is, what are we going to do? The answer is: we will do what Galicia needs, do what we said we would do and do what the chickens voted for. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, if after two legislations I\'m here today is because that\'s what we\'ve been trying to do for the next eight years and because that\'s what I have to do for the next four years. I mean, we\'re doing our electoral program, which is the roadmap that\'s mostly down in the polls. I mean that we will continue to develop the 2015-2020 Strategic Plan, always adapting the economic improvements that are taking place. And I mean, Galicia will have a government from the first day until the last day of the legislation. That is why, in concrete terms, the first decision of the new Government will be the adoption of the spending ceiling for next year; and then that of the budget, which will be presented in this House before this 2016 is over so that they can be discussed in this Parliament as soon as possible. In any case, we assure you that since January 1st we will already use the budgetary mechanisms that the Union has at its disposal – basically expected to spend – to be able to rule without any delay, as we said we would do. This is undoubtedly a decision with a relevant quantitative effect, because it will allow for a third consecutive year to sink in the growing trend and make almost 250 million euros more available to the priorities of the Greeks as quickly as possible. But it also has a qualitative dimension, because it allows us to say that the political context in Galicia is more favourable than anywhere to face our future. That\'s our commitment, because in Galicia, yes; in Galicia there is assurance that the new Government will rule for the next four years. I say that\'s our commitment, and I have the impression that it will also be one of the main examples that we can give to all of Spain. Because, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the theory that our absolute majority is a sort of vestige of the country, I claim that other one that points to our land as the forepartment of what will end in the rest of the state. We are not only the last stable majority of Spain, I have the impression that we will be the first, either through the political decision to govern the common interest of party interests, or through legislation that always protects governance, in municipalities, in self-government or in the state itself, in the face of ungovernment, or through future elections. I am convinced that the national assembly will return to stability which, fortunately, Galicia maintains intact by the will of most Greeks. In Galicia, yes, our self-government is safe from outrages because the citizens clearly delimited the role and responsibility of each of us. Over the past few weeks, I\'ve been repeatedly asked why. Why Galicia persists in its stability, when that is not happening generally in the rest of the state. Well, I find two explanations: one, inspired by circumstances other than Galicia, and one, derived from our own evolution as a country. At the external level, there are examples that show that the frivolity of the leaders, the escapism in the face of the difficulties and the demagogy that sleeps society has severe consequences. That isolationism of what we have fled is being fatal to leaders who seek to disconnect their states or communities from Europe or Spain. They propose a promised land that doesn\'t exist but they go through a desert that does exist. They subject the people to their veheties and sacrifice the present and the future of their people to illusions that bring with them a harsh hangover. Similarly, the grotesque situation that we have lived in Spain for the last ten months and the effects of prolonged paralysis during that time — especially as I will also become more detailed in this intervention — was sufficiently revealing so that Galicia decided to act accordingly and maintain its own path. But also within our land there is evidence that politics is not to promise impossible, but to work for the common good as much as possible. Ladies and gentlemen, within Galicia we are already testing and suffering the effects of treating politics as if it were a frivolous game. Politics always has consequences in people\'s lives, and anti-politics, politics consistent in avoiding controversial decisions, which is equally on the agenda in many municipalities, also carrying out sequels. Against all this, ladies and gentlemen, in recent years we have ruled a Galician that went through a deep recession and an economic crisis, but to which it faced without entering another crisis, in the institutional crisis. Unlike other territories, the difficulties did not alter institutional balances nor caused irreparable breaks in society nor did they make the community see themselves immersed in Byzantine identity debates. There was discomfort, there were protests, there were demands, which are only symptoms of a living and active nationality, but there were no ruptures. I understand that this answer, which belongs to a mature country, was the result of telling the truth and facing reality. We\'re telling the truth at all times because our people don\'t form a childish people or can be content with dialectical greed. We follow this beautiful idea of Castile, according to which, ""so that the people have faith in us, first have faith in the people."" With that faith in our renewed people, my commitment will continue to tell you the truth and face reality. To tell the truth means to claim that there are still problems to be solved, but that we are in better conditions to deal with them because there are more Greeks who have abandoned unemployment; there are more Greeks by praising Social Security; there is more industrial production in Galicia; there is more confidence; there is more consumption and tax collection; there is more hope. This most favorable data enables us to face the present and future reality with a greater strength and also with a greater perspective. With greater strength because the best economic situation translates into three direct consequences of great importance to the action of the Union, but also to the daily life of citizens. The first, more budgets; the second, more debt; and the third, less taxes. More budgets. This can be the first legislation since 2008 in which public accounts are expanding every year, and therefore with more social and economic investments. Less debt. Every time our commitment is to progressively reduce the debt/IPP ratio so that Galicia continues to be among the less indebted autonomous communities in Spain. And less taxes. Because, the same way we have done so far, and for more reason if there are more strikes, we will continue to reduce tax pressure on the Greeks. We respond to the less taxed Greeks in the crisis, and the different selective reductions are proof of that. We have responded to the less taxed Greeks when the recovery began, and since this year the biggest tax drop in Galician history has been in force, including the abolition of succession tax for the practice of all the Greeks. And since Galicia\'s course has not changed, and as the situation continues to improve, we will respond again to the less taxed Greeks in this legislation as well. [[Applause]] The best economic situation translates into more resources, but also, as I told you, in a more favourable climate to meet, in addition to the short and medium term. Because if in the first and second legislates the fundamental thing is to respond to emergencies, now — without stopping doing so — we can derive much from the efforts and tasks that call us for the next decades, but that we must start to take care of now. The 21st century is our home today and in the future, and our obligation is to build it with new codes and not with codes from the past. To that end, the initiative of the Greeks must be safeguarded by a framework of assurances and incentives that political action must provide and that they articulate around three priority objectives: to guide recovery towards a viable and sustainable economy in the future that incorporates the primary sector more strongly; to continue to improve public services by consolidating Galicia as the most attractive place to be born and to live; and to participate actively in the open territorial debate in the state, projecting abroad the German model of autonomy, especially around the model of autonomous financing. Let me transfer some of the priority lines to each of them. Ladies and gentlemen, as long as we cannot finish the task, recovery is a starting point. This confirms the current rate of growth, which is the largest of the last eight years, placing us above 3%. This is also learned from future forecasts, which indicate that Galicia will close the year 2016, growing, as I say, above 3% and that, according to many study services, by 2017 it can achieve another growth of 2.5%; but we prefer to be prudent by placing ourselves at 2.3%. It is also clear from the evolution of employment and the fall in unemployment, recorded by more than 10% last year. It is clear that intensity can be conditioned by changes such as Brexit and the future of the Eurozone, or by political contexts such as those that take place today in the world\'s first economy in the United States of America. Obviously the recovery is not complete, because it has not yet reached many Greeks. Following close to the families who remain immersed in the tragedy of unemployment, or who, having work, still lack sufficient resources for a decent life, is, as I said, our first commitment. To accomplish this we already have more instruments in place than at any other time, and with greater support, since we are developing them from the hands of social institutions and municipalities. And I want to guarantee from this rostrum the continuity of each and every one of these as long as it takes. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, Galicia is one of the communities with the greatest social commitment, and this statement will keep it throughout the legislation with facts. I am talking, for example, about the income of Galician social integration, the electric ticket, the programme to avoid cuts of light, the supplementation of non-contributory pensions, the measures in force against child poverty. Attention to those who need it most is a priority commitment, but by itself a limited commitment. Target has to be that they don\'t need us and that we can gradually reduce these urgent care games so that there\'s less and less urgency. The path to that is also drawn, it\'s employment; a higher job -- as it is already happening -- but also of sufficient quality, objective that we haven\'t reached completely yet. Both objectives will be the axis of one of the main laws that we will subject to consideration by this House in this legislation, a new Galician Employment Act that provides our land with a more favourable regulatory context, more favourable to obtain three objectives: [[Applause]] The first is to continue to reduce unemployment with the aim of creating between 80,000 and 100,000 new jobs in this legislation and the unemployment rate being below two digits. The second is to prioritize especially affected groups more intensively, such as young people, women and long-term unemployed. And thirdly, to increase actions aimed at reducing working timeliness and precariousness, increasing the level of undefined contracts, even if today there are two out of three. Let me at this point fix a key figure in our work tissue, both in the former times of crisis and in this time of growth; I\'m talking about autonomy. Their impact on the economy is indisputable. They\'re the ones who pull the most out of it with work and daily effort, but they also have a great social impact because they cover a spectrum of activities so wide that in the dust they shape our towns and our societies. You all know that in past legislation we strengthen aid for this collective, in some cases with unpublished decisions in the state, such as incentives for hiring up to three workers. But in this legislation I propose to approve a strategy, a broader strategy that converts Galicia into the most favourable place to be autonomous; more favourable for an autonomous born, expanding for a year the flat rate for the self-employed who require this additional time to be consolidated; a more favourable place also for an autonomous to grow, for example, by creating an autonomous bonus of up to 2,000 euros or by strengthening their formation; more favourable for them to have children, by extending the bonus to 16 additional weeks to reconcile and open it also to the parents; and more favourable for an autonomous to ensure the continuity of their business by opening to all autonomous the Generation Return Programme, which already exists in trade. [[Applause]] But, ladies and gentlemen, the objective of a viable and sustainable economy for the future, which improves the level of employment stability, we cannot rely solely on the will of a government or on the legislative capacity of a parliament; the key remains in the ability to consolidate among all — including social agents — a new production model, with the keys to the future, and I believe that we must strongly support knowledge and innovation. I highlight this double sink because I believe there are others who are also fundamental, where we have already been able to move forward with outstanding results, even if we have to continue to sink in them. I refer, for example, to the fact that today in Galicia it is much easier to undertake – and cheaper – to the network of business accelerators, to tax incentives, to the Doing Business office and to the elimination of the previous license to open a business. They are the clearest exponents of this statement. However, entrepreneurs are still alerting that they are not sufficient, and that is why we are now going to promote an audit that even more clearly detects the possibility of agitating all economic activity processes in the autonomous community. Similarly, any entrepreneur who needs funding knows that he already has help lines, which only last year has allowed almost four projects to be supported daily. On that line we will continue to sink too. In the same way, we have already added excellent results to the issue of the internationalization of our economy. In recent years exports have reached historical figures, and in that trend, if it is maintained, a historical figure will also be reached in 2016. In addition, we have been able to attract to our land investments of great importance in automotive, aeronautical, milk, naval... there are examples in all of them who are evaluating the way to continue opening our world. We will do so with new programmes to support internationalisation and through the direct involvement of the Government, maintaining the economic agenda as a priority within the external action of the Government and trying to explore new destinations, such as the eastern market. But precisely because we compete in the world, we have to be able to develop, as he told them, with more knowledge and with more innovation, so that we can position ourselves with greater advantage in the globalised market. It\'s a path that we also have opened, where we didn\'t even start from zero. More than thirty multinationals were installed in Galicia to develop R+D+i projects in the past legislation. The first autonomous vehicle that travelled the Spanish roads came out of here. In Rozas - Lugo - you\'re developing a pole of drones, so other communities have been fighting for time. Galicia has shown what it wants and can be an example of innovation, but it has to step on the accelerator to move faster on this path. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, the Autonomic Government has resources and possibilities to increase them if there are viable projects in the wake of the European Union-signed Strategy of Smart Specialization. And our commitment is to guide that investment to crystallize in two consequences: First, empower Galicia as the headquarters of R & D+i, for example, by creating innovation consortia that adds to the efforts of researchers, technological centres, large companies and pemes. In this line, in addition to the aeronautics – which we already have – the first thing we want to push is biotechnology, or, secondly, opening new calls for joint innovation units that attract Galicia\'s largest innovators from the strategic sectors. The second objective is that innovation incorporates itself as a systematic activity into companies — in our opinion, the greenest point at the moment in our economy. So, for example, we will strengthen the resources to make Industry 4.0 come true, that is, for entrepreneurs to incorporate smart manufacturing processes that improve the competitiveness of their businesses. Even so, just as we drive an acceleration of innovative companies in the automotive industry, we propose to extend this experience to other sectors, starting with agri-food. Or we\'ll also define a plan of suppliers to large companies that detects their recruitment needs and directs our commitment innovation to business opportunities. We need to be aware that promoting these changes is not easy, it involves changing patterns of behavior that are deeply rooted and building new capacities. It\'s complex, it involves a lot of people. Since it\'s logical, it\'s not possible without knowledge; that\'s to say, it\'s not possible without talent. Incorporating it, incorporating it into talent immediately, is already a priority action by the Board, and my determination is to take advantage of the economic improvement to strengthen the strategy of talent capture that we have in place, firstly, not only by flexing the criteria for access to aid so that they get to the most prestigious scientists, but also by increasing the resources of the Igncia program, which allows us to verify and market the projects of our researchers. This chapter is fundamental. The work of the thousands of scientists who develop with some help from Joina at universities is fundamental, as are the hundreds of people who currently work in technology centers, so we support them with more resources. But speaking of talent cannot be reduced solely to the present, we must also continue to prepare the young people today so that they can be the talent tomorrow and compete with it, and on that ground plays a fundamental role in the education they receive in the public system. The basic lines are already known to you, but I want to sink into some of the most important ones. The first, the most immediate work, is to complete the adaptation of the Map of university qualifications and the Map of vocational training, insisting on dual vocational training. Both — the two branches — have a fundamental impact on the economic environment we want to draw and also on employability in the future. This task is now started. And allow me to thank from this forum for the effort and constructive spirit that the three Greek universities have shown, as well as the commitment of teachers in general and those of vocational training in particular. In the next few years, we have to finish this process so that the education system really acts as a lifesaver of the economy we want. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, titles with futures and, within them, teachings that also serve for that future. The world is increasingly digital and technological, I demand that we devote more resources to increasing these capacities in our boys, and we will do it. This legislation has to be the reality of a really digital teaching in our public education, and for that we will draw three lines of action: increasing the structure of the Abalar plan, which now reaches 52,000 students; constantly updating the technological devices employed by the student, including the online platform for learning, and, together with these measures of greater access to computer and digital equipment, also incorporating the teachings of robotics and programming, two subjects that are called to have an essential role in the knowledge of the future. In that future of what we\'re talking about, there\'ll also be more Greek people who can communicate in other languages, because they\'ve learned them in a school or in a public school. Because today in Galicia more and more children have a trilingual education, in which, in addition to learning English and Spanish on an equal basis, they learn a third language. And our commitment is that, in addition to the 90,000 that are already in a multilingual classroom today, in the next few years we are able to, firstly, extend this measure to children\'s education cycles from 3 to 6 years old; secondly, to ensure that in each of the seven major cities there is at least one public centre of excellence in multilingual bachelor\'s degree; thirdly, to open this option also to vocational training; fourthly, to expand the internship programs for foreign language learning, especially English and Portuguese; fifthly, to extend the free tuition so that students of language schools have free tuition from certain academic levels; and to encourage the three universities of Galicia to implement international degrees, by putting in this 2017 a pilot plan for each of them to choose two titles that offer a full itinerary in a third language. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, we made a big bet that learning a third language was not a privilege but an opportunity within the reach of ever more children and children, because for us language is an instrument that opens doors. That\'s why we decided to take advantage of the Greek to close ties with the lusophone world, or we decided to put more and more resources in place to ensure that new generations dominate English. And that bet that\'s being consolidated in public education, we\'re not going to put it at risk but to complete it. Because, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of the day, what we are talking about is to adapt ourselves, adapt ourselves to a changing context, adapt us to a future that brings us in an unappetizing way. In that future, strategic sectors of our economy are already being accommodated, like the naval, which thanks to their technological capabilities was able to move from a situation without new demands to charge more than EUR 2.3 billion on public and private shipyards, despite the oil crisis. Or like the automotive industry, which thanks to the new models has guaranteed activity for the next decade and EUR 3,000 million of investment for the auxiliary industry. [[Applause]] There are also sectors that are more strongly incorporating our production system, such as the aeronautical system, where, thanks to an investment of EUR 150 million, we lay the groundwork for becoming a global reference to a sector with a great future, such as unmanned aircraft, or tourism. Tourism is not new but it is having a renewed and reinforced weight in the gross domestic product thanks to the good numbers of visitors, which, in addition, this year are going to be historic. I would like at this point to underline our desire to continue to make tourism an indisputable bulwark to consolidate recovery, especially knowing that this legislation will be key to preparing the next Xacobeo 2021. A quote of these characteristics should not be improvised or left for the last hour, and that\'s why I assure you that the goal of doing the best Jacobin in history in 2021 will be to start working from the first minute. [[Applause]] But, ladies and gentlemen, in that future that is already guiding strategic sectors of our economy today and tomorrow, in that future that we are trying to guide our boys, it must also be the Galician set and, therefore, rural Galicia, that is to say, primary-sector Galicia. About her I would like to propose to you an equally stable pact, which guarantees our unity of effort these years. In the same way that the past legislation was that of the naval or the automobile, this must be the primary sector legislation. We don\'t even want to forget that part of us. It\'s our starting point as a people, and that\'s why renewing rural is not only an economic opportunity, but it\'s also a social and cultural obligation that we have as a people so that our development is not an uprooted development. I would like to make it clear that I do not focus on this issue as a priority because it shares the defeatist vision that many people have about this issue. Living in the countryside, working at sea, I\'m not a conviction or the final resort of those who have no other. And our villages and our smaller villages are not a simple weekend destination, a withdrawal of disconnection. They\'re still home to thousands of families who have their dreams for the future. They\'ve been modernized in recent decades in a very intense way, on occasions with sacrifices that we\'ll never highlight enough. And more recently, there are also new projects underway that open new doors to this field. Of course, there are shortcomings, deficiencies that still persist, and very important challenges that remain pending. And addressing them is the commitment I also want to acquire from here and for what I ask for your support. There\'s a future. It\'s important that citizens, especially young people, have that perception. There are symptoms that the primary sector is increasingly synonymous with the future and less and less with delay. Some symptoms: this year is where most young people have applied for aid in the incorporation of agriculture, twice as much as in the last decade; training and agroforestry experimentation centres have been left vacant; the yellow wines are increasingly exposed, with greater quality and more countries; the production of tender Galicia has risen more than 20 points since the year 2009, and at that time the value of eco-production has doubled; we have produced more than half of the national wood and we continue to be export leaders; in the Marqueo, 2015 was the first year of the historic series in which the number of permits has been raised, so boosting the agri-food industry and the quality stamps that they support must continue to be the focus of our policies. But its future is further reinforced by decisions of greater scope which I would also like to stress, especially in three sectors relevant to the primary field: milk, forestry and fisheries, which are logically called to have a priority role in the next legislation. In the case of milk, Galicia has been able to preserve, despite the crisis, its national leadership in quantity, because today we have produced more milk than ever, nearly 16% more than in the last five years. And most importantly, not only in quantity but in quality. On the other hand, the sector is seen, and is still seen, limited in the field of processing and marketing, with effects on the incomes of the owners, who have neither been to us nor been alien to us, as far as a very slight upward is being perceived. For a long time in this House we all agreed that the only way out was to strengthen our dairy sector with more union of producers, with more industry. Well, I would like to say that in the last year, three major projects have seen light in Galicia, opening for the first time a well-founded expectation for a sector that has been anchored too long and without renewed impulses. On the one hand, the first, the decision to install in Curtis a milk processing plant capable of attracting nearly 1 out of every 4 liters produced in Galicia. The second, the expansion of the cheese processing plant in Vilalba with the expectation of increasing its production, which today consumes about 4% of the total milk we produced in Galicia. And finally, the recent merger of three cooperatives that are supposed to group up to 3,600 farmers that produce 15% of the total Greek milk. In short, three initiatives that together with others, something smaller but also significant, will absorb about 50% of Galician dairy production and which will be translated for the gainers who depend on more stability and professionalism, I hope that in better prices and in a more hopeful future. [[Applause]] The promotion of the true protagonists of each productive sector, that is, of the producers, is also the main axis of the future that we propose for the forest sector. In this way, we\'re going to develop measures that will include the recognition of the figure of the active forestry to, in this way, differentiate and recognize those owners who actually manage their forest properties. In this area, too, we consider the restructuring of property as a priority, so in addition to the transversal actions of partial concentration, we will promote the drafting of forest resource management plans, which will establish district-level orientations and define forest land in detail. Thirdly, they will be given a strong boost to the disincentives of neighboring mountains in common hand and to the establishment of alliances between them. Equally, fourthly, we need to act in different promotion and support measures for the forest industry, such as certification of forest management, the genetic improvement program, the creation of a specific table for the production of chestnuts or the use of pasture as a forest resource. Ladies and gentlemen, I was also speaking in this section of the fisheries sector, at a time when there are signs of recovery. Not in vain when it comes to year has reached a historical billing figure for sale of fresh fish and seafood, best of the last twenty years. Consolidating this improvement is a goal of the Sea Council over the next four years, aware that this sector depends on us but also on contexts other than on aspects such as the elimination of discards or the modification of technical measures or the control regime. All of this has a lot to do with the future of our fishing and we\'re working with the sector to achieve the best possible final situation. Because the key remains co-governance, which is not a new term but a maximum that we have been following for a long time in our dealings with fishermen, sailors and seafarers. With them and with the commitment to draw up at the Galego Fisheries Council a biannual report which puts together concerns, we propose various measures between which I would briefly highlight: greater weight of bass fishing with the objective of having preferential access to 158 million of the European Maritime Fund of Fisheries; secondly, more field of work for the seafood, giving continuity to the work of recovery of unproductive areas, which has already allowed us to recover in the past legislation 8 million square metres of sands and which has to recover and improve in this legislation another 10 million square meters of the sands; thirdly, modernisation of the boats, making the provision, as required, 30 million in the next three years so that the work can be renewed and expanded; fourthly, more resources for marketing and transformation; and, by fifthly, better use of the ports, making the most of their distribution platforms, as well as the tools of the fishing industry, making the most useful use of the fishing industry, providing the resources against the last time frame, making the best available; and the best available resources for the best disposal of the ports, the most useful use of the water supply of the power. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, the necessary economic effort we are going to make in the primary sector to ensure that growing interest is confirmed and expanded must not make us forget that, in order to complete the renewal of rural development, we must also act in social conditions and in living conditions. I said during the past election campaign that we have a debt to rural people that is not yet paid off in any case. We are moving forward with support for rural development and diversification of activities, but we need to strengthen this strategy by harnessing the resources that the 2020 RDP (the Rural Development Plan) has to offer more than 1,186 million euros. We move forward, we move forward to make it more attractive because the Land Law protects rural areas, but it also guarantees more possibilities for development, especially in the field of agriculture and tourism. But we must continue and therefore one of the priority projects in next year\'s budgets will be a rural entrepreneurship and training programme. We move forward, ladies and gentlemen, we move forward to better organize it because resources are reinforced to partial concentrations, but we need to do so even more intensively. [[Applause]] The objective is that, both through traditional mergers and with groups and exchanges that emerge from the private initiative, we can order the property of more than 130,000 Greek families in this decade and, most importantly, that we can order the property in 36% of the Greek municipalities that have agricultural, livestock or wine-growing activity. We move forward, ladies and gentlemen, ensuring services as basic as water and sanitation, and today more than half of the Greeks have a new clearance and supply service next to them. [[Applause]] But our will is to continue to complete the pending performances and, above all, to guarantee the same cost and quality of the services where they lend themselves. We move forward, we move forward and we will continue to move forward more intensively and with more ambitious measures. Not in vain, one of our main decisions in recent years has been thought of for the future of rural: zero taxes for the purchase of plots in all the municipalities of the rural of Galicia. Well, in addition to the maintenance of this bet, which will continue throughout the legislation with zero taxes to acquire any type of rustic property, one of our main measures in the future will continue to be rural, and thus, as we undertake, since January 1, 2017 there will be zero taxes for young people, for large families and people with disabilities who acquire a habitual housing in a municipality of less than 20,000 inhabitants. Ladies and gentlemen, the goal is for the Greeks to know that in order to live in rural areas they will have zero pressure on their government and that in order to live in rural areas they will count on 100 percent of our commitment. [[Applause]] Renewing the primary sector bet is beyond the simple economic objective. Behind it lies a deeper challenge that keeps in line with the second axis of government that was ahead of them: making Galicia what it will be, and making it a better place to be born and to live. That implies all Galicia, and therefore it implies that we can fully harmonize the realities that coexist in our land, urban and rural Galicia, on the inside and on the coast. And among them there must also be more stable and stronger bridges. That objective goes, of course, through connections, in the strictest sense of the word; of course, through connections that are not seen and that are the most important, technological ones, in which Galicia today has very remarkable possibilities of access but which we want to continue to improve to increase and guarantee its speeds, but also through physical connections, that is, roads and public transport. Thus, we will complete the network of high-provision pathways so that practically all of the Greeks will have a special infrastructure next to us, with measures such as ending the highway of Morrazo, ending the connection of the track with the motorway of the Atlantic, the link of the polygon of San Cibrao das Viñas, in Ourense, with the highway, the link of Area, under Mine, with the highway Tui-A Guard, the extension of the highway of the Costa da Morte, the start of the conversion by highway of the road between Lugo and Sarria, advance on the route of high-provisions of the north coast, especially on the variant of Viveiro, and continue the highway between Santiago and The Road. [[Applause]] And above all, we will seek to respond to one of the main pending issues in this area, which is the management of public transport and the need to provide a coverage tailored to the needs of the Greeks. I think we\'ve managed to lay the bases with three important features. The first, the start-up of the Metropolitan Transport Plan for 60 percent of the population of Greece, which we hope can also extend to Ourense and, on the basis of the proposal made by the municipality, also to Pontevedra. Secondly, the impulse of the intermodal stations of Vigo, Ourense, Santiago and La Coruña, which we must complete with the actual involvement of the municipalities so that they function as real hubs of transport. And more recently, by making public transport for the first time free for all Greeks and Greeks under the age of 19. But none of this is enough if we don\'t get the most important, which is to ensure that public transport reaches where there\'s a user who needs it. That\'s why I confirm to you that in this legislation we will approve a new public transport plan that goes beyond the current one, designed for the past century, and design one for this century, with services from the 21st century, such as mobile payment, for example, or routes from the 21st century, including demand transport or the option that public transport will leave the municipal limits. Ladies and gentlemen, each of these decisions I just mentioned have an immediate impact on joining our people and ensuring equal opportunities for them. But, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary for this purpose — and more now that we are beginning a period of expansion — to reinforce other strategic lines that strengthen our people socially and economically but also in values. [[Applause]] Because, ladies and gentlemen, if you ask me what Galicia wants in 2020, I have a clear answer. I don\'t pursue a perfect Galician, because no responsible politician can promise to wipe out the map all the problems, especially those that don\'t even depend on the Government exclusively. But if I aspire to contribute to a Galicia that creates more in its possibilities and, above all, to a Galicia that wants more of itself both in our days and in the coming decades. [[Applause]] For that, first of all, the growth we are consolidating must be orderly and sustainable. Unfortunately, in recent years we had to be more focused on not decreasing than thinking about the kind of growth we wanted to have. But now, in addition to working to strengthen the expansion, we must face the challenge of the future model of growth being solid and respectful of our surroundings and not falling back into past eaves. With this objective, precisely, we have created the specific councillorship, that of the Environment and Planning of the Territory, dedicated exclusively to this task. Galicia will not move forward in any way, it will move forward respecting our landscapes, our water and our air, the best legacy we can leave to our children and our grandchildren. We\'re walking towards a totally sanitized Galician water. At the end of the legislation all the water infrastructures provided for in the Galician Water Plan will be running or running with guaranteed operation, so that the 2020 Greek rivers are fully sanitized and much more protected from the greenery. And we will also create a river observatory that will enable us to value this source of natural wealth. We\'re going to walk towards Galicia with less CO2 emissions, and that\'s why we\'re going to approve the Welsh Environmental Sustainability Strategy and the Welsh Climate Change Strategy. We walk to a Galicia that optimizes the use of its energy sources. We have enormous energy potential and that is why we will approve Galicia\'s energy guidelines in order to increase the installed power of renewable sources by more than a third, such as hydraulics, wind, biomass and geothermals. Our ambition is that Galicia\'s energy needs in the future can be fully filled with renewable energy. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, we walk to a Galicia with more protected spaces, regulated by a new law of natural heritage that has new impulses, such as the expansion of the Nature Network, a Nature Network in which one can live and a Nature Network in which one can work; or the possibility that one of our most comprehensive natural spaces, the Sacred River, will be declared a reservation of the biosphere as a step prior to being the heritage of humanity. We also walk to a Galicia with a more orderly and better planned territory, because our expansion must be rational and coherent. That\'s why we\'re going to renew the Land Management Act, which has been in force for more than 20 years, which will complement the recently approved Land Law. This text will seek to ensure that the different barriers develop in a balanced way, to curb or reduce demographic imbalances and to improve access to services and infrastructure by taking care of environmental and landscape issues at all times. This goal is still very much to see the city council\'s management. We need to keep working so everyone has an updated general urban management plan. And the little ones we\'re going to help them as soon as possible with the approval of a basic plan that serves as a model for 49 Greek municipalities with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. We will continue to promote the harmony of buildings and fight against feism, so in the autonomous basic plan we plan to adopt next year we will integrate the recommendations of the professionals who are developing the guide of colors and materials. We will work for sustainable and responsible urban growth that integrates perfectly with the oldest buildings, which are also an important, undoubtedly, part of our heritage. We don\'t want to tear down the old buildings to make it happen to the new ones, but to improve them so they can fit into a beautiful, coherent set. So in this legislation, we will approve the Welsh Strategy of Rehabilitation to facilitate families today to revitalize the areas where the Greeks lived in other generations. This strategy includes rehabilitations of historic helmets driven by the Union as well as lines of support for families who want to rehabilitate both rural and urban housing. In addition, we will also promote a legislative change to promote this type of action and for the first time we will bring to the House the first law of rehabilitation and improvement of Galicia\'s historic set-up as a separate piece of legislation. In the past legislation the new Heritage Act shielded the protection of goods of cultural interest. In this new impulse, rehabilitation will ensure that houses that surround our safest monuments do not demean them, because they are also part of the legacy of our ancestors. Of course, we can\'t talk about heritage without talking about the paths of Santiago, for whom we are going to launch a rehabilitation plan and put in value the most outstanding heritage elements of the Jacobean route. Ladies and gentlemen, looking to the future is not to forget the past and make a blur and new account. We want Galicia to be firmly seated next decade on the shoulders of those who preceded us, Galicia of the future will be built on our natural heritage and our historical heritage. [[Applause]] In our essence as people is, of course, the state of well-being. Public health, public education and public social services are also an important part of our heritage. Ladies and gentlemen, we will remain non-conformists. After being able to shield public services in the face of the crisis, after being one of the few autonomous communities that has improved them remarkably in recent years, after that, for more reason now that we can work in the long term, we will not conform. I am convinced that the vast majority of us trust to leave our children and grandchildren a public health system, an educational public system and a first-level public social system. Including in this chapter, in a very special way, the need to continue to improve justice, an issue in which it is necessary to accelerate the challenge of computerization, as well as to create important infrastructures such as the City of Justice of Vigo, the new judicial building of Pontevedra, the new judicial building in Tui or the rehabilitation of the tobacco factory in the city of Coruña. At this point, I would like to explain to you that the new government will have as a novelty, among other things, the Galaga Infrastructure Agency, and this agency will assume the recruitment and construction processes of the health and education centres. In this way, departments that manage public services can devote all their efforts to it, improving public services. They will undoubtedly be the ones who decide where a hospital is located, how a hospital is expanded, where a health centre is put, where a school is set up, or where an institute is reformed. But it will be the Infrastructure Agency to ensure that the works are delivered in time and adequately integrated into the territory. Health, education and public social services can thus focus on responding to the great challenges of the public services of the 21st century, which I believe are customization and adaptation to the demographic context. We want public services that are at the service of the well-being of citizens, and we have to be able to give every problem of every Welshman the most appropriate solution in his case. In coping with this challenge we have a powerful ally, a powerful ally to support us, which is technology. It offers us incalculable possibilities for improving public services. We will continue to use it, as we have shown in the past to make the biggest health investment in innovation in the area of the Galician Health Service since its creation. Thanks to that, the waiting list data we know in June are the best since there are logs. And we want to continue to move forward — in addition to completing the bet so that in this decade 100 percent of the Greeks we have in our health area a new hospital or a renewed hospital and a new health center or a renewed health center — with new public outpatient clinics, of course; with three new major expansions: the great Montecelo, Pontevedra, as well as the public hospitals of Ferrol and the public hospital of the Navy; also expanding the public hospital of Santiago in the framework of the reorganization derived from the construction of the new Faculty of Medicine; completing the expansion of the public hospitals of Coruña and Ourense; and expanding also the emergencies of the public hospital of Barbados. Finally, together with the remodeling and updating of the Mexoeiro Hospital, we will complement and complete the pending works to make a new health service come true, from the point of view of their infrastructure. [[Applause]] In this way, we are weaving along and wide of our territory a network of well-being that supports all the Greeks. In fact, their main support is so much of the citizens we believe in these public services and that we will continue to defend them as the Greeks and the Greeks that make it possible every day: teachers, doctors, nursing, health care personnel, non-health personnel, social services staff. For them, as for the rest of the public employees, I would like to say that this legislation will be at which they recover the wage level lost during the crisis, and will recover from the first year of the legislation. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, in order for our network of well-being to be solid and sustainable, you must take into account one of the peculiarities of our land: demography. Public health, public education and public social services must have a vocation of permanence and a basis for them to adapt to the changes that Galicia will experience in the coming decades. I was saying before the structural challenges we have to give generational responses, not partisans. I\'d like to need even more. When we talk about the welfare state, the answers must be intergenerational. We must be able to start a process of joint reflection, in which it participates from our youth to the Greeks with more springtimes, to be able to respond to the needs of all the Greeks. The Galician welfare network has to give intergenerational responses, from the cradle to the third age. With this philosophy, we are working to consolidate Galicia as the best place to be born and to be a child. We will continue throughout the legislation with the Welcome Card, designed to accompany the Greek families during the first year of their baby\'s life. In addition, those homes at risk of poverty or social exclusion will be entitled to it until the three years of the life of the child or child. Families are the atoms that make up the Galician society. We\'re going to work to provide suitable solutions for families in the 21st century, facing two essential challenges, such as rationalization of hours and reconciliation of working and family life. We want a Galician where parents have time to spend with their children, to accompany them and guide them in their growth and transmit values to them. That\'s why we will continue to expand public squares in children\'s schools, as we have seen since 2009. In this legislation we will consolidate the zero waiting list in children\'s schools and create new squares with the view placed on a much higher coverage ratio than the European Union proposes, specifically reaching 40% of the coverage ratio. Not only will we create a thousand new squares in the Blue Chicken network, but we will also improve what already exists, so that our children can enjoy better facilities. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, our goal is to give each family the solution that best fits their specific needs. For the homes where the parents work and their son get sick on time, we commit to them the Bono Care. For families who can\'t get access to a public nursery because they\'re complete, we commit to them the Bono Concilia. For parents who work in an industrial policy, we will subsidize their construction of childish schools. For rural families, we\'re going to extend the childcare pilot program, because we believe that smaller municipalities also have access and rights to childcare services. With the horizon of 2020, we will make it possible for the 313 municipalities in Galicia requesting it to be able to count on a conciliation service. [[Applause]] We are aware that founding a home is not an easy task, but since the autonomous government we will give the mothers and parents unconditional support. Galicia will continue to offer tax deductions to maternity and paternity. In addition, we will dialogue with the new Central Government to try to reduce the VAT from some basic products, such as leathers. The family has to occupy a central place in Greek politics, because it also occupies it in the lives of the Greeks and the Greeks. Ladies and gentlemen, if the 75 members of this House remind us of our slogans, this would have been a bad legislation. We must be reminded of our measures, for they have been useful to the families of this country. There\'s no better legacy than making Galicia the best place to build a family. This has nothing to do with acronyms or colors, it has to do with political responsibility. [[Applause]] The secret of our future, ladies and gentlemen, is that today\'s Greeks decide to bring the Greeks into the world tomorrow. We want the Greeks tomorrow to be trained in values, so that we will train our schoolchildren on equal terms, with regard to our symbols, in particular with regard to the language. We want the Greeks tomorrow to have all the doors open, so that we will extend multilingualism — as I said — to children\'s education and vocational training. We want the Greeks tomorrow to freely choose the path they want to take, for which we will continue to increase the opportunities offered by vocational training and maintain the cheapest university rates in Spain. Galicia 2020 is going to offer many more opportunities to the Welsh and Germans of the Statute generation. We\'re going to work so those who have taken the path of emigration and want to return to their land can do it. Although Galicia is the Spanish community with a lower rate of youth emigration, we are aware that many girls and boys at the time of the recession did not find an opportunity on this land. At the same time, we\'re going to try to bring second- and third-generation Greeks who are residing in countries where traditionally in the 1960s and 1950s the Greeks emigrated. The return of these Greeks from Argentina, Uruguay, Cuba or Venezuela will also help revitalize our society and fill Galicia with new blood that drives us in the coming decade. We\'re going to bring solutions to the Greeks that have just been born, to the children and boys and to the parents and mothers of the family, but also to our elders. No one doubts that they are an indispensable part of Galicia. Without his experience, his dedication and his opinions, the country we know would simply not exist. In order for them to continue to perceive their importance for Galicia, we are betting on active aging. We will continue to strengthen our attention to dependency, both by creating new public squares and by pushing the home aid service, so that the elderly can receive the necessary care at home. The demographic challenge we are facing is especially a significant challenge for all, but especially within public services, not only for social services, but for public health. We face a paradigm shift, where it will be necessary to renew the way in which health services are understood. In Galicia of the future health will not be limited to the physical spaces of hospitals and health centres. We\'re going to develop a German Chronic Care Plan, so that it can give patients more tools to alleviate their illness. We are going to strengthen home hospital units and home care since primary care. The house itself is the ideal place to improve the quality of life of the patient. We will also adopt a programme of api to older people living alone, especially in rural areas, to improve their eating habits and encourage physical activity. Also, thanks to the digital home, we want to improve communication with health professionals from home at twenty-four hours a day. We will continue to advance towards a health care that gives more importance to prevention than treatment, with the Italian Antimicrobial Resistance Plan and the extension of colon cancer crybate, which will apply throughout Galicia, after these years of piloting experiences, starting next year. Finally, in this legislation we are going to promote intergenerational response to Galicia\'s problems today and tomorrow. A Galician that guarantees sustainable well-being for the Greeks, from younger to older, without neglecting specific realities, such as disability, a collective with which we will continue to work, their hand, to facilitate their integration and their accessibility. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to achieve this goal, I would like to hold them by hand. I want to take this moment to invite you to reflect together on the demographic challenge. It\'s a challenge that doesn\'t understand political colors and that affects all of us equally. Demography will be a central issue in which we are left for the decade and more in the near future. Finding answers is not just the Government\'s task, but the whole of Galician society, and of course the 75 Members and Members of this House, who together we should continue to promote the debate on this matter, in all national forums, but also in all European forums. Giving social and economic support to the demographic context, to the public services of the future, is a challenge that calls for us in the short, medium and long term. But immediately, also collectively, we have to deal with another capital matter which I refer to at the beginning of this intervention. I am talking about the negotiation of the new model of self-financing, which, of course, must be completed here on the subject of local funding. Ladies and gentlemen, three are the criteria on which Galicia\'s initial position will be based, of course, regardless of the arrivals I hope to receive from all groups of the House. I didn\'t want ours to be a government position, but a position of everyone. That\'s why I\'m setting out some basic lines that obey the interests of the country and its reality. It would be incomprehensible for Greeks like us to defend political positions that may be in favour of other historical nationalities, but not Galicia. Unscrupulous trading would be reckless, reckless and terriblely harmful for the viability of self-government. Firstly, funding must be stable; secondly, funding must be sustainable; and thirdly, funding must be progressive. The financing must be stable to the provisionality which has been addressed before, especially in the current model, which runs counter to the rigour required of such a matter of relevance. Galicia needs to complete institutional and political stability with the stability of the autonomous financing model. We understand that such an elemental principle can only be discussed by those who wish to have a permanent Korean state — and consequently weak. Secondly, funding should be sustainable. Central government and autonomous communities add up to two parts of the same State, which share rights derived from the Community and international commitments of Spain. Nor is it worth a model that ends up being frustrating by unreal or by making autonomy the poor and beggar relative of the Spanish public administrations. And thirdly, funding must be progressive. If there is supposed to be a solidarity transvasion between higher and lower personal incomes, through taxes, that same principle should not cause fear when applied to people who live in different autonomous communities. Nor is the fact that the meeters are given priority, against those who have applied the rule in a lax and clearly little strict manner, and have benefited from the systematic failure to meet the public deficit. [[Applause]] To these three guidelines could add the idea that the new financing system is exactly that: a financing system. It would be a mistake to try to resolve problems of an identity in this debate. The reason is obvious: the well-being of citizens, which is what is ultimately at stake, cannot be at odds with pressures derived from low-responsive play. It would seem otherwise incongruent that if they were given the same rank to sovereignist claims of some specific community parties than to the factors that really measure the needs of citizens, such as population dispersion, the cost of infrastructures or the demographic challenge. The first is subjective, the second is clearly objective. I fully trust the latter to mark the path of the new state executive, who has to lead this debate, among other things because the President of the Government has already made concrete commitments, such as the inclusion of a Demographic Cohesion Fund. Ladies and gentlemen, the groups of this House can have different ideologies, of course, but I sincerely believe that in this matter we all have the same answer to the question that Galicia needs, which interests Galicia in the new financing model. Of course, I would rather start this debate in the State with the question that seems to dominate all the forums: with what model would certain sovereignist options be comfortable, in view of a scheme made up of such or which community? I want Galicia to be a voicer of Galicia and defend an equal position of all citizens. And, of course, that\'s what we\'re going to do with force, but with loyalty to the state, of what we\'re part of. [[Applause]] Because, ladies and gentlemen, self-government is not valued by the degree of agitation or controversy it causes, but by its effectiveness in solving problems. That some Welsh people are worried about their identity or that certain political sectors use that identity as something controversial, doesn\'t mean that Galicia is in a divan wondering what it is. Galicia is standing and has just clearly stated which way she wants to go. And that doesn\'t mean, at least, that our community is less marked than others. Ours is simply an integrative identity. I know that, in view of the level of crispation that there are — that some autonomic leaders encourage — there may seem to be those who find it impossible to combine State loyalty with Galicia\'s legitimate defence of interests. But of course it\'s possible. Galicia has contributed in the past to the economic improvement and stability of Spain, without preventing it from raising its voice when we consider that some decision was not fair or positive to our community. This same attitude will mark the next few years if I gain the confidence of this House. Especially to ensure that the blockade suffered in Spain in recent months has not prevented the State from fulfilling its commitments to Galicia for far more than ten months. The clearest example of this that I\'m telling you is high speed, that we\'ll ask it to be completed. Both in the planned events, especially for the planned Horizon 2018, and to include other news that are also essential, as well as the connection of AVE to Lugo and Lugo-Ourense-Madrid in less than three hours. And we\'re not going to give up on this. [[Applause]] At this point, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to transfer what I am counting on with the support of all the groups to defend that Galicia cannot pay with the AVE that has been pending for decades or the budgetary privileges that some want to obtain or not the bill of paralysis that has been because of who has committed to prolong it for almost a year. I am fully aware that the national situation demands more will of dialogue and agreements than ever before. The open majority I propose to develop in Galicia for more reason has to practice in the state as a whole, given the parliamentary arithmetic. This situation is not new. Not so many years ago, another Central Government has ruled in the minority. But my request, my confidence and also my commitment are that the script that follows is not the same as the last time that government ruled a minority. At that time, the result was not favourable because that situation — we all remember it — resulted in the submission of sixteen autonomous communities to the interests of the political groups of an remaining community, which, being important, is no more important than the others. Parliamentary stability in our country is fundamental. But it will not be achieved at the cost of investments or any other need for funding from Galicia or any other community. The result of this negotiation we\'ve seen: it was a historic failure. Ladies and gentlemen, Galicia will always ask for two prerequisites in relations with the central government and the other autonomys: loyalty and unity. Without them, any possible answer to the problem presented by some in a unilateral and illegal way will be a mistake with disastrous consequences for the stability of our democracy; consequences that would affect the autonomic model, consequently the self-government of Galicia. That\'s why we\'ll be vigilant and always try to add up, not to stay. I mean, therefore, the unit. This is an objective and fundamental aspect that should not be diverted to properly focus our country\'s participation in common tasks. There\'s no state space and no autonomics, but they\'re both the same. That\'s why to mention the relations between Galicia and the state, or between any other autonomous community and the state, is at best a bad habit of ordinary speech, and at worst a trap with which sovereignist proposals are to be paid. In accordance with this principle — precisely set out in Article 137 of the Constitution — Spain\'s development of self-government must be given priority to the greater, more intense and more frequent participation of communities in the definition of State policies. Galicia\'s claim — which becomes a model of stability and political strength — is to expand the connection of central and autonomous bodies in order to transform the state into a genuine community of autonomy. We aspire to a broad and permanent connection that allows the state will to be an aggregate in which autonomous will also participate. There is no more to expose the motive idea of Title VIII of the Spanish Constitution, without the need for further and controversial constitutional reforms; to establish that the Conference of Presidents is no longer exceptional and almost symbolic in order to become ordinary and effective. That in my opinion, in our opinion, would be a step forward. [[Applause]] There is no greater enemy of the debate about the territorial model than nominalism. We are forced to discuss words that soon become labels to end up being euphemism. It\'s funny that apparently more devaluedism is what offers the most precision and, at the moment, more consensus. I mean autonomy. We know it\'s autonomy. It is reflected in the statutes and already has a reasonable period of operation. However, we ignore the fact that federalism is proposed or the multinational state, which acts as a mantra for some sectors. To those who urge an immediate reform of the Constitution in order to respond to the secessionist challenge, one must ask: Why? And for whom? The first paragraph of Article 138 of the Constitution points out that the State must ensure solidarity and economic balance between the territories. Is this an obsolete warrant? The second paragraph warns that differences between statutes cannot involve economic or social privileges. Is this paragraph to be repealed? Article 139 of the Constitution establishes the same rights and obligations for Spaniards throughout the territory of the State. Can we consider an old-fashioned thing that governs all democratic countries? We can explain that before we embark on a debate of this calibre. And it is appropriate to clarify in advance whether it is to promote the functioning of the autonomous state as a whole or to deploy certain leaders from certain autonomous communities. Galicia cannot support a process that has no direction and no point of arrival, nor does it support systematic insubordination to the legal framework that we have done among all. [[Applause]] Let me add something else in this chapter. Ladies and gentlemen, you will certainly agree that it is surprising that some who advocate urgent constitutional reform, or even a new constitutional process, are reluctant to cross-border political pacts. Capulets and Montescos exist in their political culture; there are parties with which a sort of apartheid must be practiced. Overcoming those anomalous prejudices in any Democrat would be a necessary condition for a successful eventual reform. I\'m going to finish now, ladies and gentlemen. I appreciate your patience. Nothing they\'re referring to so far will fulfill the expectations of the Greeks if the rhetoric of this rostrum does not translate into facts. I am perfectly aware of the immense responsibility my people, Galicia I feel, Galicia I love, Galicia I respect, have provided me. But I wouldn\'t feel, I wouldn\'t love, I wouldn\'t respect democratic Galicia if I thought that responsibility was infinite in function and time. Galicia is my land, but Galicia is not exclusively mine or none of this House, because Galicia is everyone\'s. Ladies and gentlemen, Galicia is the one that we occupy the government benches and the opposition benches; it is the one who put us with their votes in this Parliament and those who preferred to stay in the house; it is the one who follows this session and also those who don\'t want to know anything about us. [[Applause]] Galicia is everyone\'s, and we all have a responsibility to do it for us so our children can have a chance to make it their own. Here\'s the moment, here\'s the reason, here\'s the obligation of those we are called upon to answer with our work the questions that have been raised to us. I know that the past legislation does not constitute the best example of behaviour this House should have, but democracy does not understand resentment. The sins that could be committed between these walls have already been spied out in the polls. That\'s why I don\'t demand respect for myself, for my Government or for my group; I demand respect for most of the Greeks represented here. I demand respect as a citizen, and I call for cooperation as a politician so that our responsibility which has given our people to us all and each one of us may manifest itself in the fruits of our work. [[Applause]] If in 2009 I had the group I belong to with thirty-eight Members, if in 2012 with forty-one, and now again with forty-one and even more votes behind, it\'s because I understand the absolute majority not as a closed absolutism but as an open consensus to which more and more Greeks can be added, so do you. Despite all the disappointments accumulated since 2009, despite the negative response from the opposition, except for exceptions — which I remember very well the exceptions and the groups — every time the Greeks asked us to sum up efforts to combat the crisis, most of the time we did not have them. But I assure you that I have the same disposition as the first day to incorporate everyone into a country policy, because Galicia never excludes anyone. There is a majority that is open to all Greeks and open to all members of this House. The first step to get us to work together and share responsibilities, which in a parliamentary system does not reach a single person, is to accept the result of the vote that will put an end to this debate next Thursday. If we believe in democracy above personal daughters and phobias, in progress above party struggles and in Galicia above all, I\'m sure that the negative votes I can receive in my investment will not be a brake on the progress of this land, just as the favorables cannot be a blank check for the government that I aspire to lead. In the face of the democracy of the acrylic and non-circuit, the Greeks always say it depends. Hopeful does not depend, we forget the dialectic of easy applause and the blow on the table, so that the only gesture that matters is what improves the lives of our fellow citizens, and so that what replaces what we ask each time we get questioned by means of our vote in this Parliament. Galicia and Spain were built on great consensus that we can update. But that won\'t be possible if we don\'t make an effort to recover them before. Losing fear of agreement is the first step in coping with the future without cowardice. The Greeks would not understand that the seventy-five Members and Members of this House did not agree in defending everything that unites us, everything that is part of our personality as a people and our future as a country. The Greeks would not understand, ultimately, that our egos were above self-government that the generosity of those who preceded us made possible. I sincerely believe that an idea is not good or bad depending on who proposes it, but on our ability to put it into practice for the benefit of citizenship. I sincerely believe that consensus is not an end in itself, but rather the best means of transforming the country, with the participation of all those who represent their plurality, without exclusion, without vetoes and without red lines. I believe, frankly, that we are faced with another opportunity. But this is no longer the first time we\'ve seen the train pass in a hurry while we\'ve been arguing. Before, with their votes, the citizens of this country judged the political project that I was lucky to lead over these years, I uttered a sentence that condenses into five words my way of understanding and exercising politics at this biological and political height in which I find myself: I am militant of Galicia. I believe that all of you, on the left and on the right, can do these words too, and we can all carry the spirit of the greatest party in this country, the party of 2,700,000 militants: Galicia. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, we exercise that militia to defend one of our greatest signs of identity, but also a great asset to the challenges we face: our language. After moving, along with civil society, a plan of economic dynamization, it\'s time to make one\'s own among young people, who is the wife of Galicia coming. We exercise that militancy to preserve our past, through Galicia\'s digital memory, so that our present leaps with the set-up of a cultural dynamization network and our culture has a future, driven by new actions as a plan for the Greek audiovisual sector. We exercise that militancy to hold bridges, narrow ties and show the world the pride of what we are and represent, not to separate ourselves or others. We exercise that militancy to plot our future together. The members of the Group We and the already centenarian Brotherhood of Speech, the Galeguist in the Second Republic, the heroes of cultural resistance and the parents of our autonomy, the presidents Albor, González Laxe, Fraga and Emilio Pérez Touriño — all of them from different thoughts — shared the same militancy: Galicia. His first answer was always Galicia. They said Galicia and now Galicia is present, because, despite the difficulties we have faced during the last century, the Greeks never cease to exercise what we are: Greeks. [[Applause]] Galicia is present all over the world, where there is a Greek, and we must present it right here, among whom we have the honour to represent them all. Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce this investment so that the Greeks will be present for the next four years, in the same way that they were present in every and every one of the decisions we make at the most difficult times. I\'m introducing myself to this investment because Galicia is present in my thoughts, in my feelings and in my behavior since I am president of the board, and also before. Because Galicia is aware and because, above all, I am convinced that Galicia deserves to have a future. [[Applause]] This future, ladies and gentlemen, brought the Welsh and the Greek in the same way as the lives of those we\'re here. We are beside them in what they do and at their disposal in what they decide. It is the Greeks and the Greeks who have placed us here; it is the Greeks and the Greeks whom we owe; it is the Greeks and the Greeks whom I owe to them all that they are. I have no words to thank the Greeks and the Greeks for their trust, but I can assure them that my answer will be to be able to look into their eyes every day at their service. And when I\'m no longer here, after giving everything to myself to fulfill the greatest honor of my life: Galicia, Galicia, Galicia. Thank you very much.']","<|system|>

[[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] After our budget presentation on October 21st, talks were completed in the Plan and Budget Commission on October 27th and November 27th 2020 and on the 2021 Central Management Budget Law Proposal and 2019 Central Management Computational Law Proposal. The 2021-Year Centre Management Budget Law Proposal, Plan and Budget Commission finalised its final form at the end of the 20-day merger. I would like to thank the current and former presidents of our Plan and Budget Commission, members of our valued deputies, and our esteemed ministers, the valued representatives of our public institutions, the employees, and all the contributions they\'ve made. As of today, we have begun negotiations on our budget\'s Parliamentary General Assembly. Our budget talks at the Grand National Assembly of Turkey -- the aim of national will -- are the basis for democratic control of the executive body. Our budget proposal, a road map of actions by the Presidential Cabinet, has been prepared for our most effective vision of delivering public services to our nation. This budget, which we offer to our Supreme Assembly, is the third budget of the presidential government system, bearing the benefits of the system\'s flexibility and dynamics. Our budget, including education, health, justice and security, is the basis of our concrete and medium-term goals, which will increase our achievements in all areas, from energy to agriculture, without transportation to industry, under the leadership of our President. The basic mission of the 2021 budget is to ensure that Turkey\'s economy progresses in solid and predictable steps in the global restructuring process due to the Covid-19 outbreak. The goal of our budget in this framework is that our new country normally takes its rightful place on a global scale. Mr. President, good lawmakers, progress in Turkey\'s development columns is the result of our love for Turkey, great zeal and hard work. With government programmes, development plans, topic-based strategy documents and action plans, including our president\'s prime minister\'s prime minister\'s prime minister\'s prime minister\'s prime minister\'s term, each step has been carefully studied and implemented, along with his transition to the presidential government system and plans for a hundred and eighty days of progress. Our vision of the future, such as 2023, 2053 and 2071, has been stitched up, touching citizens both in the centre and in the local area and implementing public services, huge artifacts and sustainable policies that advance Turkey. Our budget for 2021 will take our progress further, and will be the basis of our new success stories in line with the expectations, demands, and dreams of each of our citizens. As in our budgets in the past, this budget is the budget of our workers, our business people, our farmers, and all our entrepreneurs who have been producing value by the sweat of our laborers, the economy; our health workers who have sacrificed their homes away from their homes, their families, our teachers who have turned their homes into a classroom, our security forces, who are seeking the help of our elders; we are sufficient for the shocks of economic uncertainty; we are able to say, ""We are enough."" The 2021 budget is the budget of Turkey, which has dried terror at its source, and has established peace and security in each corner; the national budget of Turkey, which has completed its 4th National Antarctic Science Expedition in 30 days, which has contributed most strongly to Karabağ\'s freedom in forty-four days with defence industry products developed by national means. The 2021 budget is the budget of Turkey, which leaps in public service with its e-state - digital Turkey - and carries the bar into space with Turkish satellite projects. Our budget aims for more prosperous tomorrows for our women, the most important wealth of our country, and for our students. In the conditions of the epidemic, there is no such thing as a public, private sector and university, which can produce respirators in 15 days, in a state of need, and can extend a helping hand to the world as well as to the East Mediterranean, Syria, Libya, there is no such thing as a struggle for rights in Libya, we always say, if it\'s impossible, it only takes time. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] With this budget, we will make possible impossible breakthroughs, make hard investments easier with unity and the spirit of barberism. With our 2021 budget, we will try to increase, improve and improve our country in the light of our goals. Our budget will be based on Turkey\'s success stories and its triumphal battles, such as 18 budgets in the period of EC PARTY governments. In our next year\'s work, we\'re going to go up in gear again, and we\'re going to sign up with our nation, side by side, and we\'re going to do it again. Mr. President, the high-value lawmakers have a central management budget for 2021, which we have prepared under the performance-based programme budget system, a structure that allows the needs and expectations of society to be more accurate in the budget, linking public resources with public services, and strengthening public financial management. With the performance-based programme being transferred into the budget, the budget has increased more than the inputs and has been prepared, implemented, monitored and evaluated with a result-oriented approach, and the budget has also been made simpler and more understandable. Our budget is a functional budget to support our fight against the Covid-19 epidemic, which aims to boost both investment and employment and reduce inflation and current deficits, in line with the New Economy Programme goals. My speech on the whole budget, developments in the world economy, developments in Turkey\'s economy, achievements in public finances, economic measures for the Covid-19 epidemic, revenue policies and practices, budget development and predictions, the final management account of 2019, the central management budget of 2020, the central management budget of 2021. Mr. President, valued lawmakers, we\'re going through a difficult process where uncertainty is at a high level due to the pandemic of coronavirus, which has affected the entire world. The epidemic affects societies deeply in many ways, while the global economy has the most serious economic shock in recent history. In this process, both production and consumption have fallen at the same time, millions of people in the world have been unemployed, and despite all measures, the destruction continues. According to the International Fund\'s October global economic outlook report, the world economy is expected to shrink by 4.4 per cent this year. This is the deepest recession in the world\'s economy since the 2009 global crisis. We have drawn up our budget in this difficult environment where the Covid-19 epidemic has a global impact on economic and social life and risks and uncertainty. In 2019, trade wars between the United States and China slowed down global demand and confidence, global growth and trade volumes in the eurozone, widespread poor performances in the eurozone, uncertainties about Brexit, reduced investments in China by tight credit policies, and financial normalisation in developed countries, especially the United States. In 2020, historical setbacks were recorded on both production and demand on a global scale as a result of measures and restrictions against the outbreak of Covid-19 -- which was already being introduced in a slowdown global economy -- this year. In the second quarter of 2020, the effects of the epidemic have seen significant reductions in economies, massive job losses. In this period, industrial production and trade volumes have declined sharply, and retail sales have seen declines. The rapid spread of the epidemic has left devastating effects on health systems in many countries, including the United States, Italy, Spain, Britain, and has caused serious damage in the economic areas, particularly in the service sector. In particular, tourism and transport sectors have suffered severe impacts in the process. The country\'s currency has lost its value while capital currents have broken down against developing countries in the process. According to the International Fund\'s October report, economic recession in developed economies is expected to be 5.8 per cent this year and 3.9 per cent growth in economic recovery in 2021. In 2019, developing economies, growing by 3.7 per cent, are expected to shrink by 3.3 per cent in 2020 due to the epidemic. The growth of the country\'s group is thought to be back to 6 per cent in 2021. Despite some recovery of global economic activity from May 2020 due to measures and financial support packages brought into existence to support those affected by the plague, the countries\' normalisation steps have maintained low-profile risks. It is estimated that global growth will occur by 5.2 per cent in 2021, along with the overall recovery and base of the country\'s expanding monetary and financial policies, economic activity, as well as the current inoculation. Mr. President, in 2019, the unemployment rate was 5.4 per cent at a global level. While measures packaged by governments have been implemented to limit the negative effects of the epidemic on employment, significant increases in unemployment rates have been observed on the global scale. The loss of employment has been felt especially intensively in the service sector. Weak global activity can lead to permanent damage to supply capacities, productive capital loss, and a long-term increase in natural unemployment. In 2019, average annual inflation in developed economies at 1.4 per cent is estimated to take place at 0.8 per cent in 2020. The inflation rate of developing economies at 5.1 per cent in 2019 is estimated to be 5 per cent in 2020. Although the price of oil started at 70 dollars per barrel in 2020, Brent was placed on a $40-50 tape after falling to a very low level. In the coming period, oil prices are expected to remain at these levels for a period of time. Due to the epidemic, the low movement in tax revenues has again increased pressure on public finance, mainly due to health expenditures and large financial support packages. The stockpile of debt, which tends to increase worldwide, has also begun to threaten the sustainability of public finances. At this point, in the coming period, the path of the epidemic is clearly unpredictable when the revenues of services, especially tourism revenues, will recover, the break of supply chains, fluctuations in the price of commodity and geopolitical tensions are the main sources of the global economy. However, the approach to the end of vaccine and treatment studies and the extension of enlargemental fiscal measures to 2021 are thought to be factors that could reduce risks at a global level. Mr. President, after the balancing process, the Turkish economy continued its trend of uninterrupted annual growth after the global crisis, growing by 0.9 per cent throughout the year, due to a strong growth performance of 6.4 per cent in the last quarter of 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, there was a positive 4.5 per cent growth in many countries, but in the second quarter of the year, Turkey\'s economy was narrowed down by 9.9 per cent due to the narrowing of economic activity by measures to prevent consumer behavior and the spread of the epidemic, as a result of a recession in foreign demand, due to net goods and service exports. As of June, with the number of cases dropping, the restrictions imposed under the epidemic have been eased, and the economy has entered a rapid recovery process as of the third quarter. Unsubstantiated from season and calendar effects, the illegal domestic product has confirmed strong recovery by 15.6 per cent in the third quarter of the year, increasing by 15.6 per cent compared to the second quarter. In the third quarter, Turkey\'s economy has achieved 6.7 per cent growth in support of domestic demand for improved financial conditions. Despite the re-enactment epidemic restrictions, we predict a positive growth of 2020 years. Preliminary indicators for October and November also confirm our expectations. In 2021, we aim for growth to show a balanced view of domestic and international demand and to grow our economy by 5.8%. We set up this growth process in a way that does not contradict our efforts to maintain macroeconomic stability and combat inflation, and we will carefully follow every step of the process. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, with a 5.8 per cent growth targeted in 2021, we also predict rapid recovery in economic activity and as a result of improvement in employment and employment rates. As a result of strengthening the economic security environment for employment, employment incentives will continue to be effectively implemented, along with the implementation of delayed investments and increased production. At the same time, we will be taking structural steps towards the labour market, such as extracting skill inventory, boosting business-work integration, updating vocational education programmes based on skill, accelerating integration into digitalisation, effective career counselling and targeted implementation of active labour force programmes. According to 2021, employment is expected to increase to 1.58,000 people and reduce unemployment to 12.9 per cent. Mr. President, the high-value lawmakers were reduced to 11.8 per cent in 2019, when positive navigation, moderate demand requirements for food prices, improved inflation expectations and cost pressures were eliminated, and the TÜFE annual increase rate lost momentum. In 2020, the relative high course of motions and food prices at the annual rate of acceleration was eliminated and annual consumer inflation took place at 14 per cent -- yearly -- in November. It is one of our main goals that inflation has been permanently reduced to low and single-digit levels, both as a result of broad-accessed consultations with different parts of society recently, as well as the implementation of policies envisioned in the New Economic Programme. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, as I mentioned in the global development section, the Covid-19 epidemic has become a major suppressive factor in the global economy, and there have been major reductions in global trade volumes. In our largest export market, European countries, slowdown in economic activity has had a negative impact on external demand. In 2019, we predict that in 2020 we will catch YEP targets and even rise above them in the annual exports of 180.8 billion dollars. Our export target in 2021 is 184 billion dollars. We also see that Turkey\'s advances in design and high technology have not yet reflected in our exports at the desired level. With that consciousness, in the coming period, we will be concentrating our efforts towards increasing our exports of high-end products. Turkey will continue to be an important actor in global trade by adapting with new-generation applications to changes in global trade and supply chains in the post-19th period. As global tourism comes to a standstill, we predict that our annual travel revenues over $30 billion in pre-infected travel revenues will occur at $10 billion in a sharp drop in 2020. In 2021, with the impact of the epidemic eased, we estimate that travel revenues will increase as a result of the recovery of tourism. As Covid-19 gradually decreases the destruction of the global economy, increasing capital trends in developing countries, reducing risk premiums and optimizing the environment for quality capital inputs will be the key determinant of external financing. The current accountability deficit is expected to take place at 1.9 per cent in 2021. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers have minimized the negative effects of the epidemic in our country, allowing our banking sector to continue to work in a healthy manner, in order to ensure that the outbreak of global financial markets is less likely to be avoided in our country. As a matter of fact, the printed indicators confirm the integrity of our banks. As of September 2020, the Turkish banking sector\'s average capital efficiency rate was 19.4 per cent and the core capital efficiency rate was quite high with 14.8 per cent. At the same time, the sector\'s indicators, such as liquidity, foreign money position and leverage, are at high levels, much higher than the minimums envisioned by international standards. As of September 2020, our banks\' self-source profit was 12.3 per cent and their active profitability was 1.2 per cent. The proportions point to the strong financial structure of the sector. During the year 2020, the banks, along with the banks, were again taken the necessary measures to access the funding resources of our real sectors, and the banks were allowed to keep their credit channels open. This approach led by our public banks to prevent the spin of the economy\'s wheels and the rise in unemployment during the epidemic. Using loan markets to support the real sector is not unique to our country. Due to extraordinary conditions, many developing and developing countries have implemented measures such as the flexibility of the arrangement to use loans for the protection of commercial institutions and consumers or loan support packages. Mr. President, I\'d like to point out that the loan expansion, led by public banks at the time of the outbreak, is vital to the continued activities of our firms and the continued employment of these institutions. In the pandemic process, our public capital banks, of course, performed their function for the reasons of existence -- in these difficult days, they were on the side of our farmers, our farmers, our SMEs, and our investors, for short, the real sector, but they never deviated from basic banking practices and principles. The most concrete proof of this is that our public-owned banks have a strong compliance with the generally accepted banking standards, especially capital competency. You know, the minimum capital efficiency rasio requested by the BDDK is 12 per cent. Our three major public banks, as of September 2020, have capital competency rates that range from 15 per cent to 18 per cent. Another important indicator is that loans turn into chasers, while the banking sector average is 4.1 per cent, and our three public banks vary between 2.10 per cent and 3.73 per cent. When we look at the rate of loans that turn into chases in other countries, we see that Turkey is far above them. For example, 6.1 per cent in Italy; 9.2 per cent in India; 9.3 per cent in Russia; 31.3 per cent in Greece. In addition, in this process, our public banks have shown strong support for the real sector, as well as their profitability rates. These data show that our public capital banks have performed their basic functions by standing next to the nation during these difficult days, but have never been broken from the basic principles of banking. Of course, in the process, the Turkish Entity Fund, which is a capital public institution, and the Treasury and Finance Ministry, have stood behind public banks and offered the necessary support within the territory of ownership. This is a natural and desirable situation, which should be valued as a manifestation of the rational stance in our view of the banking system. For years, private capital banks in our country have been subject to such practices, regulations and standards as well as public capital banks. Our public banks, regardless of their capital, are also subject to any regulation and control of the BDDK, which follows the international practices, are also under the supervision of the Court. Mr. President, dear lawmakers, in this part of my speech, I\'d like to talk about what we\'ve achieved so far for public finance. Thanks to our firm fiscal discipline and discreet policies during the time of our governments, the budget deficit and public debt stock are no longer a risk. In 2002, the GDP of the central management budget deficit at 11.5 per cent was reduced to 2.9 per cent in 2019. It appears to be low compared to many developed and developing countries. Similarly, in 2002, the GDP of EU-defined general management debt at 71.5 per cent was 39.4 per cent in 2020 as of the second quarter. This ratio is also relatively low compared to EU member states. According to recent data, in EU member states, the GDP is 87.8%. At the same time, over the past 18 years, the stockpile of debt has been significantly reduced to the risk of currency, interest and liquidity. In this scope, the five-point increase at the TL interest level has improved by 0.5; 1.5 and 0.5 points, respectively, compared to 2020, due to the lack of debt in domestic product scenarios in which TL is losing 5 per cent of value and 2 points in GDP growth. One of the most important achievements in public finance is the public-private cooperation model (KOI). With this model, we have reduced the burden of large-scale and signing projects, including infrastructure investments such as highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, and increased investment needs in health care presentations, such as city hospitals, once again understood during the epidemic. About 10 per cent of public investments completed during the EC PARTY administrations have been implemented by the KME model. The facilities built with these investments will be transferred to the public at the end of the contract period, even bringing in revenues by the age of the right to run again. Besides, if these investments are preferred at the end of the contract, our government will be able to run them. We\'re doing a lot of major investments at the same time, no more pushing our budget, no more public debt burdens, and in less time compared to their counterparts. For example, the new Berlin Airport was only completed in 14 years, even though it was one-third the size of Istanbul Airport, which was completed in a record period of three and a half years. Istanbul Airport\'s investment amount is 10 billion euros. This investment was built by the company in charge, and its first phase was launched. The project did not receive a guarantee payment in 2019; rather, it was paid for and paid for the state air squares. The total amount of rent we\'re going to collect during business time is 22 billion euros. In 2020, international and national aircraft travel, as in all over the world, will be reduced, and the average annual rent costs will be much lower than guarantees or compensations. This is unique to the epidemic period, with air traffic returning to normal, and the State Air Squares Administration will not pay guarantees, but will continue to receive a share of the money, as well as the rent. In short, at Istanbul Airport, without any payment from our treasury, except for the time of the plague, our state will have a airport worth 10 billion euros and will have collected 22 billion euros in revenues. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Also, we\'ve acquired 17856 qualified bed beds, which are one-quarter of our total bed capacity, with 13 city hospitals that we\'ve completed in a short period of three years. We also acquired the Eurasia Tunnel, which has 12 international awards, including the Project of the Year, Best Project Funding, Best Environmental and Social Applications, Best Innovative Project and Global Success, to our country in four years. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] All public-private co-operation projects will be handed over to our government at the end of the contract period, with renovation investments invested in infrastructure and exponential structure. With the KCI model, classical financing, we bequeath to our future generations by making the greatest works available to our nation in 15 to 20 years, four to five years short of ready to serve. We give our country the capacity to fight disasters like the Covid epidemic that happens once a century, and we inherit airports, bridges, tunnels, hospitals, in world standards that will save time and cost for years. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Mr. President, the valuable lawmakers have been the lifeblood of our economy in the uncertain climate of the Covid-19 epidemic, which we have achieved so far in public finance through cautious financial policies carried out by the EC PARTI governments. In this framework, we took action in the early days of the outbreak, creating and implementing the package of the Economic Stabilisation Shield. We supported our businesses by postponing tax and social security bonus obligations. In this case, we\'ve postponed the $29.4 billion tax payment and the $40 billion social security premium. We also provided a tax reduction of $15 billion. So, when the spending of the Covid-19 epidemic was included in the cost of financing, including delayed revenues and discounts, we saved a total of 59 billion dollars from the budget. As part of the Social Support Programme, we paid $6.3 billion, $21.8 billion, $5.1 billion in cash, and $4.2 billion as part of the unemployment fee. In addition to spending from the budget, we have increased the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund and provided access to financing for businesses that are short of collateral. We\'ve created 326.5 billion-dollar credit packets for citizens, tradesmen and firms, and we\'ve paid a total of $267.8 billion in loans as of November 2020. In order to minimize the effects of the epidemic on employment, in terms of working and social life, during Covid-19, we have imposed a contract annulment ban on employees. In this scope, we have provided cash allowance for those who are not eligible for short work grants and unemployment benefits and who have been granted a free leave of absence. On the other hand, as part of the Business Shield Package, we\'ve brought the fast-tracking, employment incentive and plus employment incentive to support economic recovery after the Covid-19 outbreak. In order to support the tourism sector from the most affected sectors of the epidemic, we have implemented credit programmes for tourism businesses, administrative fines for cancellations, delaying rent payments, and the Safe Tourism Certificate Programme. As of November 2020, steps to support the economy under the outbreak of Covid-19 reached $562 billion, 562 billion! Mr. President, I\'d like to brief you again on income policies and practices in this part of my speech. We are building our revenue policies to support sustainable growth in terms of our economy\'s goals and priorities, to finance public spending in a stable and healthy way, to ensure income justice, to contribute to domestic savings and to support price stability. Law number 7256, which was legalized last month, has been allowed to restructure tax and social security premium debts. It is important for our taxpayers to use this opportunity to restructure their debt and pay for the structured sums on time. In addition, if some domestic and foreign assets -- money, gold, foreign currency, mortgages and other capital markets -- are not moved into the national economy until June 30, 2021 -- will not be taxed and taxed. We expect citizens to bring their assets into the country\'s economy. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, we will continue to fight off the off-the-book economy and continue to promote the use of information communication technologies in the fight against tax loss and fugitives. Again, with the off-the-book economy, we will review the regulations for taxing revenues by using electronics and social media. We\'re going to review the tax returns and simplify them according to the opinion of the taxpayers and the professions in order to increase the voluntary fitness and ease of doing business. We\'re also improving their efforts to increase tax awareness, to improve voluntary harmony through effective information on the rights and obligations of taxpayers and tax practices. Mr. President, in this part of my speech again, I would like to share with you some of the sizes of the Central Administration\'s Final Account Law Proposal in 2019: in 2019, budget costs were 1 trillion 27 million, budget revenues 870 billion 280 million, budget deficit deficits of 124 billion, 747 million, non-interest deficits of 24 billion, 808 million dollars. In 2019, the budget costs in 2019 increased by 0.8 per cent, especially according to the initial budget forecast, according to the estimate of the end of the year, based on the forecast of the year. However, our revenues increased by 0.6 per cent, according to the initial budget forecast, by 0.9 per cent, according to the forecast for the end of the year. The central management budget deficit, which was 124.7 billion dollars in 2019, is below $44.1 billion in the initial deficit and below the estimated year-end forecast. Reports of the year 2019 of the Court\'s Presidency presented to our Parliament have been evaluated in our Plan and Budget Commission. In the framework of accountability and fiscal transparency principles that our government cares about, our institutions are meticulously involved with the issues identified in the reports. Mr. President, our expectation of year-end budget improvements in 2020 is this: in 2020, we estimate that the central management budget costs will be 1 trillion 212.3 billion, the central management budget revenues will be 973 billion 129 million, the budget deficit will be 239 billion, 168 million, the non-interest deficit will be 101 billion, 768 million dollars. At the end of the year 2020, we estimate the budget deficit will be worth over $100.3 billion, with $239.2 billion. We estimate that this deficit is going to be 4.9 percent. If we look at the details of budget costs in 2020, we estimate that the costs of personnel will be $291 billion, social security agencies will be 48.5 billion, the revenues of goods and services will be 105.7 billion, the current transfers will be 500.2 billion, the capital costs of 86.7 billion, the capital transfers will be $10.9 billion, the interest costs of $39 billion, the interest costs of $137.4 billion. In 2020, we expect tax revenues to be around $790.7 billion and non-tax revenues will be around 182.4 billion. Mr. President, dear lawmakers, in this part of my speech, I\'d like to give you some information about the Central Management Budget Law Proposal of 2021. In our budget budget for 2021, budget costs are 1 trillion 346.1 billion, except for interest costs 1 trillion 166.6 billion, budget revenues 1 trillion 101.1 billion, tax revenues 922.7 billion, budget deficit is estimated at $245 billion. According to the economic rating of the budgets of 2021, the distribution of the budget costs is 326.6 billion, state premium costs of 54.5 billion, property and service costs 89.1 billion, current transfers are 536 billion, capital expenditures are 103.7 billion, capital transfers are 8.8 billion, subsidies are 9.9 billion, interest costs are $179.5 billion. According to the estimate of 2020 years of central management budget revenues in 2021, it is estimated that 1 trillion 101.1 billion dollars will increase by 16.7 per cent of tax revenues to 922 billion $744m and non-tax revenues will reach 178,402 million. Mr. President, the primary goal of the budget of 2021 is to protect and improve the gains achieved within the framework of economic stabilisation, the permanent facility of production and efficient sustainable growth and fair sharing and the negative impact of the Covid-19 epidemic on the economy. The budget for 2021 will be a service budget, as it was in the previous years. Our resources in the budget will largely be used to provide services that our citizens need. Mr. President, good lawmakers, health is the head of the areas where we make the biggest investments. In 2021, we earmarked $78 billion for the Ministry of Health and its subsidiaries, $5.1 billion for the institutes of higher education, health and research centers. Health ministry and higher education institutions reach $238 billion in health care, given their return capital and health expenses from the Social Security Agency. Thus, in 2002, we predict to increase the budget of health expenditures of 11.3 per cent to 17.7 per cent in 2021. So far, we\'ve been getting the results of our investments in health care in the time of the epidemic. While the health systems of the world\'s most economically powerful countries fail in this process, we are making a successful test because of our health infrastructure and also our human resources in health. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] In an environment where people are left to die in their homes in many countries and the United States, including some EU member states and the United States, people are being treated only for lack of social security system, thousands of dollars in bills, while we in Turkey offer the best quality health care, and we continue to offer it free of charge. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] When we look back on the past, we still remember how our citizens suffered for days, weeks in hospital queues, that our needy citizens could not get health care even in emergency rooms, as if it were yesterday, as if today. If our people could get to the doctor, they couldn\'t get to the medicine, they couldn\'t get the right treatment. Today, the AK PARTI is bringing our citizens from abroad to Turkey for treatment by aircraft; at the right time, more than 150 countries and 11 international organisations are providing medical supplies and equipment support, and it\'s coming up, we\'re fighting the epidemic without creating our domestic respirator and harming even one of our citizens. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Since March, we\'ve added 12,350 to the bed capacity in our hospitals, including 3,427. We\'ve opened two emergency hospitals on the Anatolian and European coast of Istanbul very quickly, at a record level. We\'ve planned these hospitals to serve as well after the outbreak. The epidemic process showed once again how important access to health care is. The recent implementation of city hospitals has contributed greatly to the fight against the epidemic. In addition, we have implemented additional measures, such as the search of our citizens with the call system, Covid-19 positive, and the tracking of patients by mobile paramedics in their homes. We\'ve spread the diagnostic labs, we\'ve worked meticulously to track contact, to get the drugs to our citizens, and to supply them with protective substances. We\'ve encouraged domestic production of the drugs used in the Covid-19 treatment, and we\'ve come to the stage of human practice in local vaccine studies. By April 2021, hopefully we\'ll have our domestic vaccine ready. Besides, with the deals we\'ve made, in the coming days, our healthcare workers will start their inoculation studies, a priority. So we\'ll be among the first countries to start vaccine studies early in the day. The vaccine will increase our fighting power, but in the process, we will continue to carefully comply with measures that we call masks, distances and cleansing. I wish for immediate healing from here to all of our patients who have already been treated once again. For those who have lost their lives, I wish you God\'s mercy and my condolences to your relatives. Another important issue on our health-related agenda is the prevention of violence in health. The violence of our dedicated health workers has hurt all of us. In the past April, we had established an important legal arrangement against violence in health with the consensus of all parties in our great Parliament. Violence against health workers, each of which is precious to each other, is absolutely unacceptable. We will continue to take the necessary additional measures in the coming period. On this occasion, I would like to express my gratitude to all of our employees, including our medical staff, who have worked the night and day during the outbreak, and to all who have done the work, on behalf of myself and my people. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Mr. President, we continue our work at the point where education services, one of the most basic public services, are widespread and accessible. We spend $211.4 billion on education in 2021. Thus, in 2002, we increase the budget of 9.4% of the education to 15.7 per cent. During the time of our governments, education has had significant improvements to increase human and physical capacity. In other words, we did the appointment of 629,000 teachers during our administrations. With appointments, significant improvements have been made in the number of students per teacher. The number of students per teacher in the 2002-03 school year dropped from 28 to 18 in primary school, to 16 in the 2019-2020 teaching year, respectively. We\'ve also improved the physical capacity of education through the resources we\'ve devoted to education. In the 2002-03 school year, the number of students per class dropped from 36 to 30 in elementary school, to 24 in the 2019-2020 teaching year respectively; there are even more serious ways to take. The free textbook application began at elementary schools in 2003-2004 and was expanded in 2006-2007 to include secondary education institutions. From the beginning of the application, 3.2 billion textbooks were distributed and $6.9 billion were spent. In 2002, there were 76 universities in our country, while the number rose to 203. According to 2002, the number of university students increased by more than 5 stories and increased by 8 million, while the number of employment professors increased from 70,000 to 176,000. With the growing number of colleges and students, we\'re constantly increasing the resources we\'ve devoted to our universities. In 2002, we raise the budgets of higher education institutions, which are 2.6 per cent of the budget, 14.6 times higher, to 45.4 billion dollars in 2021, 3.4 per cent of the budget. Thanks to the infrastructure that we have, we did not disrupt our education and teaching at higher education through the EBA, through the first and secondary schools, through the infrastructure of universities. In 2012, we removed the tuition from the first education and open school, and we cover the tuition from the students within our budget. In 2021, we earmarked $763 million to pay the tuition of some 2.3 million of our students. Mr. President, our esteemed deputies know the value of our fertile lands and our veteran farmers, and we\'re doing first with our agriculture and forest policies. In 2021, we\'re raising a total of $42.4 billion from our budget to agriculture. In this scope, we\'re saving $22 billion for agricultural support programmes, $12.1 billion for agricultural sector investment funds, agricultural loan subsidies, acquisitions, agricultural KİT and export supports. In the last 18 years, agricultural support has increased by 12 times. The amount of agricultural support, which was $1.8 billion in 2002, was raised to $22 billion in 2020. In 2002, bonus support is given to 5 products, while 18 products are given to 18 products today. Our agriculture, forest and fishing sector has grown by 2.8 per cent in the last 14 years, with the right and rational policies applied, leaving behind many leading European countries today. The sector completed 2018 years by 2.1 per cent and 2019 by 3.7 per cent by the quick decision-making mechanism provided by the presidential government system. Our agriculture, forest and fishing sector grew by 5.3 per cent during the first nine months of 2020. According to World Bank agricultural product data, our country was ranked fourth in Europe with $24.5 billion in 2002, behind Italy, France and Spain, with 48.5 billion in 2019. In addition, we are among the top 10 countries in the world. Based on external trade data on agricultural products, our country is a net exporter in agriculture. In 2019, 1.827 agricultural products were exported to 193 countries. In the first nine months of 2020, after the outbreak of Covid-19, 13.3 billion dollars in exports of agriculture and food products were given $3.6 billion in foreign trade surplus. Mr. President, important lawmakers have been implemented in the area of transport and communication; the creation of transport and communication infrastructure; the prioritization of transport investments with the corridor approach; strengthening international connections; boosting railway loads and passenger transport; supporting high-moded and balanced transport; ensuring Turkey\'s cyber security against international threats; providing fiber communication infrastructure and broadband communication communication across the country. In 18 years, we\'ve built a total of 1,581km of highways, so we\'ve reached 3.325km of highway networks. With only six provinces connected to our 6,101km-long network of roads, which were divided from 2003 until October 2020, our divided road network reached 27,714 km and connected our 77 provinces. A total of 18 billion and 501 million dollars a year, including a savings of $6 billion,905 million in fuel, 11 billion, 596 million in labor power, thanks to divided roads. As of 2003, our railway line length of 10,959km was increased to 5,803km, a total distance of 12,803km, 2,505km, 6,526km, 2.082km of electric line lengths increased to 5.753km as of October 2020. Along with these, the number of passengers carried through iron in 2003 rose from 77 million to 246 million in 2019 and from 16 million tons to 33.5 million tons in the end of 2019. In 2003, the number of international ports was 152, while in 2020 the number increased to 180. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, we\'ve had successes over the last 18 years that have exceeded everything that\'s been done in the entire history of the republic, as a key element of development. By collecting 33,000 square kilometers of seismic data in the Eastern Mediterranean and 33,000 square miles of seismic data, we completed nine deep sea drilling ships with Fatih and Yavuz drilling ships. We have made the largest discovery of natural gas in our history in the Sakarya basin of the Black Sea, 175km outside of Eregli. We discovered a 405 billion cubic metres of natural gas by drilling in the Danube-1 well launched on July 20th. Our legal drilling vessel, which was delivered on January 31, 2020 and left Mersin Taşsü Harbor, will begin its operation in the Black Sea in the early months of 2021. As part of these studies, we will open about 40 wells in the Black Sea\'s Sakaryan basin, and in 2023 we will present this gas to the use of our citizens. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, about 46 per cent of electricity produced in the first nine months of 2020 was provided from renewable energy sources, 34 per cent from coal, 19 per cent from natural gas, and the rest from other sources, and the share of domestic and renewable resources was 61 per cent. In 2021, Turkey\'s power of electricity power was intended to reach about 100,000 megawatts. In the 2000s, only five of our cities used natural gas, but from 2018, all of our 81 provinces, 559 districts, and 165 organised industrial areas were supplied with natural gas. The number of natural gas subscribers -- 1.3 million in the 2000s -- has increased to 17 million in gas subscriptions, while 80 per cent of our country\'s population has been offered natural gas use, while the population has been actively benefiting from natural gas has increased to 55 million. Mr. President, valued lawmakers, we\'re saving $50.6 billion from our budget for real-estate support. In order to support production and employment in particular, in 2021, we allocate $27.7 billion for employer\'s premium support, $5.5 billion for loans on treasury bail, $5.5 billion for agricultural loans provided through the Agriculture Bank, $5.5 billion for interest support of interest, and $3.8 billion for loans provided through the Public Bank. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, we\'ve launched the Technology Focused Industrial Movement Program, which is a state-of-the-art support mechanism for the production of high-tech products in our country. At the first stage, we published support decisions for projects in the machine industry. So with about $2 billion in investments, we allow for domestic production of high-tech products such as servo engines, CNC countertops, adding manufacturing machines. The construction of Turkey\'s Automobile Factory, which was launched on July 18th, is planned to be completed in 18 months and to be removed from the production band in the last quarter of 2022. A environmentally sensitive mobile ecosystem will be implemented along with the TOGG, thus contributing to the transformation of the automotive sector. Mr. President, valued lawmakers, in the defence industry, we take special interest in not taking any product from outside, especially in critical products and materials, reaching its goal of nationalism, 100 per cent. The opening of the delivery and design centre of our tourism engine, designed and built by Turkish engineers, is the defence industry, and it is the harbinger of a new phase in high-tech. With our Turbofaft project, we\'re building a test infrastructure in our country that can test the engines in this class and so on. This infrastructure can also be used to test higher power-class engines, such as the national combat aircraft engine. More than 700 projects are already under way by the Defence Industry Presidency. As a defense industry, we are now one of the world\'s leading countries in the production of systems such as the design and production of warships, the drones, the drones, the UAV, the TIHA, the ATAK helicopter, the FIRTINA. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Only a few of our defence industry projects, some of them: the new generation fighter TB2 tactical drone system, the TCG Anatolian attack ship -- the lower plane ship in a sense -- and now hopefully we\'re targeting our original aircraft ship -- BORA, KASARGA, HISAR and CORKUT systems, long-range air and missile defense systems, HURK, ANKA drone system, the naval rifle, the ALTAY tank, and the armored vehicles. The first four ships, Heybeliada, Büyükada, Burgazada, Künalıa, were also served under the Millgem Project, which was patented by the National Defence Ministry. Our achievements in the defence industry also contribute very seriously to our firm implementation of our national and international policies on the field and at the table. We see the impact of progress in our defence industry on the field both within and outside our borders in our successful fight against terrorism and in our support for the future and future of our fellow and brother countries. The last example of this is that we are at the side of Brother Azerbaijan, with all our means against the invader Armenia. (AK PARTY) Armenian, in Karabakh, the international community has become silent while slaughtering civilians without a word, women and children. Are we surprised? We\'re not surprised, it\'s what they always do. We know this silence better than Idlib, than Hama. We know this indifference of the international community better than Palestine, Yemen, and Arakan. In the face of human persecution, our President challenges seven heifers, if necessary, in the face of this silence of the world, we stand by the right and the truth for our friends, and we will continue to take it. This is what we do in Cyprus, in Libya, in Iraq, in Syria. Our support for the rescue of Karabagan from the invasion of Armenia is a need for our dignity in foreign policy as well as our brotherhood. As I congratulate Brother Azerbaijan on his victory, I strongly condemn the land of an independent state, the land of Karabakh, who tried to make the Armenian invaders succeed. We will continue to do our part as Turkey to ensure stability, peace and peace in our region, following policies in favor of human, conscience. Mr. President, the esteemed lawmakers, we\'ve made a transition to a new era of social policy practices. By starting our Family Social Support Programme, we have moved from the idea of demanding services in social policy practices to supply-oriented service. In our budget for social spending in 2021, we\'ve raised our resources to 81.2 billion dollars. This amount corresponds to 6 per cent of the 2021 budget; in 2002, it was 1.3 per cent, and the source we set aside was only $1.6 billion. If you count some of the important pencils in the social spending budget of 2021, 12.7 billion per month for people who have no payability, 16 billion for senior months over 65, and 4.9 billion for pensions connected to disabled and disabled relatives, 2.1 billion for social and economic support, 2.1 billion for social aid and solidarity, for student housing allowance, 10.9 billion for disability housing support, 8.6 billion for student loans, 8 billion for student loans, $5.9 billion for student scholarships and student tuition, 4.9 billion for education support for the disabled, 2.1 billion for social and economic support for students, 2.1 billion for student housing allowance, and 1. Mr. President, we have women on the front lines of our big and powerful Turkey photo. Under the leadership of our president, we are making great efforts to get our women to the level they deserve in every aspect of life. For the peace of our society and the assurance of our future, we are conducting policies to strengthen the family union. We took part in many legal and administrative arrangements that we\'ve made so far. We\'ve removed women\'s social participation and barriers to employment. We have been particularly sensitive to preventing violence against women, and we maintain that sensitivity. Whatever the reason, if a woman is a victim, we put her under the government\'s protection umbrella, and we\'re working to prevent new victims. We must all fight together against abuse, violence, or persecution that targets our women. We will continue to protect our young girls who were kidnapped by the terrorist organization, who were stolen from the mountain, and our women who were abused, and our women who were subjected to violence, with the same sensitivity. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] In this direction, we increased the budget for the Women\'s Strengthenment Program by 19.8 per cent in 2021. We will continue by providing more resources for our work, such as Financial Reading and Women\'s Economic Strength Seminars, Turkey\'s Engineer Girls, the Mother Project at Work, the women\'s co-ops strengthening work and active women\'s labourforce supports and insurance premiums for women and incentives. We\'re going to strengthen our women\'s guesthouses and social services centers even more. Mr. President, the number of youth centers that operate to ensure that young people consider their free time efficiently and efficiently has reached 350. As of November 2020, the number of members in these centers rose to 2.3 million at the same time. Thanks to increased sports investments, the number of sports facilities reached 1,575 in 2002 increased to 3,774 in 2020. Between 2002 and 2020, 2,513 neighborhood football, basketball and volleyball courses were built; 1,365 synthetic football fields, 904 sports halls, 56 track and 174 swimming pools. Mr. President, valued lawmakers, the basis of the rule of law state is judicial independence. The basic motivation of our legal reform line is an independent, neutral judicial system that works well. In the past period, our system of democraticisation has been greatly new, especially the Constitution and its fundamental laws. Innovations on social and democratic rights such as the protection of personal data, the constitutional protection of child rights, the development of union freedoms, the right to give public officials collective contracts, the right to information and individual application have been implemented on a constitutional basis. The Judicial Reform Strategy Document, a reflection of our view of reform, was announced by our President on May 30, 2019. With the help of our High Council, we have recently implemented significant amendments to the legislation within this scope. With these changes, laws on the protection and development of rights and freedoms have been adopted that strengthen access to justice in our system of executions, regulations and trials that are facing solutions. The implementation rate of the Judicial Reform Strategy Document, covering 2019-2023, has yet reached about 50 per cent in its second year. In accordance with the schedule we set, we are determined to continue our work without slowing down. We stand by our legal reform will, as we have now. We strengthen the rule of law on the basis of reforms and increase the functioning of democracy. At the same time, we are improving the investment climate and building solid legal grounds for new opportunities in economics, and we will soon bring them to the agenda of our great House. All 81 counties, each home and each of our citizens, we will continue to implement the necessary arrangements one by one in the coming period. Mr. President, we believe that our budget for 2021, as a citizen-oriented operating budget, will be based on the highest quality public service in order to improve the development of our country and the well-being of our citizens. We will not compromise fiscal discipline in the implementation of our budget in 2021. As I end my words, I wish that the Central Management Budget Law of 2021 and the Central Management Management Law of 2019 should be good for our country and our nation. Because of the perspective, leadership and support of the process, I thank Mr. President, our Grand National Assembly of Turkey, our Minister of Strategy and Budget, and all the ministries that have contributed to the creation of our budget proposal, particularly the Treasury and Finance Ministry, to all of our relevant, relevant, connected public institutions, and I salute you all once again.', ""Mr. President, dear lawmakers, I salute you on behalf of myself and our President. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] I wish that 2019 Central Management Budget Law Proposal and the 2017 Central Management Act would be a blessing for our country and our nation. Our Treasury and Finance Minister made the technical presentation of the budget today. During the time set aside for the administration, I will first try to assess the budget in terms of the actions of the President's Cabinet. In addition, I will try again to respond to the issues mentioned under budget so far. We see budget talks as a means of exposing and accountability the vision of the government's executive body for the nation. In this regard, budget talks at the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, the site of national will, are historically important. The first budget of our new management system will also be inherited in the future, by contributing to the establishment of the procedures and the words applied in both the Commission and the General Assembly. Turkey has passed through the new management system to strengthen democracy, speed up decision-making and implementation mechanisms to serve our nation more effectively. We think that if our cabinet makes what we call a road map, the budget proposal, the better our valued lawmakers discuss, argue, and improve, the greater gains we're going to get. No doubt that any opinion expressed in both the Commission and the General Assembly is valuable, important to us. I sincerely thank the President of the Plan and Budget Commission and its valued members and all of our esteemed deputies who have contributed to the creation of our budget in 2019. Mr. President, good lawmakers, as it is known, Turkey has moved to a new system of governance with a constitutional amendment adopted by our nation during the 16 April vote. We will continue our journey by supporting this historic step with new reforms, which we have implemented in the June 24th presidential and parliamentary elections. 2023 are our goals, and again, the 2053 and 2071 visions entrusted to our young people by our President, our children, are an expression of our enthusiasm for our future, our hope. Those who don't have dreams don't have goals, and those who don't have goals don't have programs. Turkey has dreams and goals and programs for the future, praise be to God. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Our 2019 budget, which we discussed, is the first leg of our three-year New Economic Programme, which has been announced by our Treasury and Finance Minister in recent months. The manipulative fluctuation we experienced recently didn't take us away from our targets, but rather, it led us to more tightly embrace our goals. As a country that has hosted the most important part of the world's largest investments for a long time, we are determined to maintain that title in the coming years. In matters of the future of our country and our nation, we can achieve these goals much easier if the political institution can act in unity and unity. The way to raise our country is not by law, by law, by law and by judgment, but by harmony with one another. Our new management system allows our nation to make choices on governance and legislation every five years, thus maintaining stability in fundamental policies. This is how we secure the stability and confidence that we long for most in our multi-party political lives has increased our responsibility to our nation. As an executive, we are committed to creating planned, programmed, efficient, fast and transparent inventions that will move our country further. As the President's Cabinet, we carried out a really busy study from election date to today. The projects our cabinet will conclude in the short term were announced by our President with the 100-day Executive Programme. The completion of the transition process and the determination of our ministries for the next five years were part of this 100-day program. We have completed the first 100 days largely, and we have prepared for the first 100 days. In the coming days, our president will share the first 100 days with our nation and the two hundred-day goals. We also know that our Parliament has carried out very important legislature studies. Our political parties are also preparing for the March 2019 local administration elections. This whole picture is an expression of Turkish democracy's operation and power. Our nation, July 15th, has demonstrated its determination to preserve the future of its country and its own at the cost of its own blood and its life, to preserve democracy. We too strive to be worthy of our nation by doing our best. And that's the understanding of our budget proposal, and we offer it to your approval. Now, we're going to make a general assessment of the global economy and the Turkish economy, and then we're going to talk briefly about the work of our ministries. I'll also be considering foreign policy developments that matter. Mr. President, the valued lawmakers are now integrated into the global economy, making significant distances in the business of goods and services, as well as in the financial sector. This success makes it necessary for us to keep a closer eye on the developments in the global economy. Global trade has seen a loss of momentum in global economic activity in 2018, under the influence of protective policies. With tight financial conditions and geopolitical tensions, global growth forecasts have been upgraded in the lower direction this year. The global financial crisis in 2008 revealed its faith and need for comprehensive reform policies in many countries, but it is another risk that reform practices cannot be carried out at the desired speed and production indicators point at slowing down in many countries. Mr. President, we have seen once again that the macro foundations of Turkey's economy are solid, with all the progress we've had in the past few months. With effective coordination, in place, in time and in the right direction, the threats to our economy have been successfully eliminated, we've eliminated. The New Economic Programme (YEP), covering the period 2019-2021, was prepared in this exact understanding. With this program, we aim to reduce our vulnerability to a minimum and move our economy into the future more strongly. Thanks to the macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that we implemented during our AK PARTI administrations, we have given the Turkish economy overall stability, and by expanding our economy, we have upgraded our country to a major league. In our country with a young population, women are particularly involved in the labour force, as well as employment levels are constantly increasing because our government has an attitude that protects its employee, its worker. For the past few years, we have also implemented many measures under the leadership of our President to support the employment market against shocks against our country. In the year 2018, when global economic conditions became more difficult, as we predicted in the New Economic Programme, our economy entered the balancing process. The slowness of our growth in the short term, however, is consistent with our sustainable, balanced, and healthy growth goals, providing a growing economic recovery. Mr. President, we're determined to move our production and export structure from low-tech to middle-tech. As of 2017, our total production exports share of middle-field technological products reached 34.6 per cent. However, we are also aware that in order to become more competitive and larger players at the global level, high-tech products must be raised to much higher levels in addition value. Fighting inflation is one of our most important goals as part of rebalance. We are aware of the cost of living with high inflation. We have a firm stance in our fight to reduce inflation in terms of improving the investment climate and boosting our international competitiveness. We will continue to take every possible precaution based on this goal. One of the main tasks of the state in economics is to maintain and maintain balance between controlling and regulatory practices and market actors to ensure the efficient functioning of the free market economy. In order to ensure that, our government is firm in implementing the necessary measures. Mr. President, the esteemed lawmakers, we have paid a great deal in the past to compromise fiscal discipline. We will continue to maintain our firm position in this field so that we will never experience this experience again. We've made significant improvements in our public financial balances through our cautious financial policies, the importance of fiscal discipline, the structural reforms we've taken into existence, the decisive struggle we've waged to reduce unregisteredness. Thanks to successful and cautious finance policies during the EC PARTI administration, the GDP of interest has been severely reduced. The share of interest costs in the budget is 40 per cent before our powers, while we reduce it to 12.2 per cent in 2019. On the other hand, in 2002, about $86 of each $100 tax revenue will go to interest payments, while in 2019, only about $16 will go to interest payments. Mr. President, under the New Economy Programme, we will implement our budget in line with our goals of maintaining macroeconomic stability, maintaining fiscal discipline, improving current balance, reducing inflation, increasing employment and improving revenue distribution. One of the most important features of the budgets adopted by the EC PARTI authorities, as I've already said, has been to constantly increase the resources set aside for social benefits, education, health care, agricultural benefits, local administrations and investments that will reflect directly as services to our citizens while reducing interest from the budget. Mr. President, we aim to ensure that our valuable lawmakers are provided with our work in the field of welfare and services in need of social assistance and protection, and that our orphaned children will be given protective, preventive, educational services, and that our disabled citizens will benefit from all the services offered to the community. IN THE period of our EC PARTY, we have constantly observed the living standards of our employees' financial and social rights improvements and increased inflation in public officials' monthly and wages. We've achieved the world's example in fighting poverty. We became the country that reduced poverty rates in the world by 2015 to 1.58 per cent by lowering the rate of public population living at the rate of less than $30 per cent in 2002. We've tripled the GDP rate. In the last 16 years, we've done about 283 billion dollars' worth of social aid to our needy citizens. We took important steps to ensure equal opportunities for disabled individuals in education, health, and employment. From 2002 until the end of November 2018, we provided employment for 382,000 disabled citizens. We've always been at the side of martyrs, veterans, and veterans. So far, we've employed 24,139 people near martyrs, veterans and veterans. By strengthening the network of welfare and employment, we supported the employment of our women and young people. Between 2007-2017, our employment increased by 3m35,000 people. During this period, our country, which has increased women's employment by 63 per cent, has been ranked first among the OECD and 28 members of the European Union. (Applause from the EC PARTY) Turkey has been the country that has increased its overall employment between EU candidates and member states in 2007-2017, both numerically and proportionally. Mr. President, we've re-divided the highest share of our budget to 161 billion TL. As we have increased our resources for education during the EC PARTY administrations, the schooling rate has also increased. There have been significant decreases in the number of teachers and students per class. In the year of 2018-2019 education and teaching, we continue to study and teach at 68,471 schools, officially and privately, at all levels, with 1 million 126,851 teachers and 17 million 658,637 students. Our number of students per teacher is reduced to 16 in primary school and 12 in secondary school. In all the geographical areas of our country, teacher-full rates have been raised at a close rate. As of today, our number of universities has reached 207. Our next work will now focus on further upgrades of quality. Mr. President, we're also increasing housing and scholarship opportunities for our young people. Mr. Elvan, they've given us a detailed report on this. I'd like to repeat once again: In 2002, 75 cities and 57 districts were serving our students with the total number of 182,000 beds in 190 dormitories. Today, around 670,000 beds have been reached in 81 districts, 239 districts and 4 in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. In the investment and rental programme, our national capacity will reach 881k by the end of 2021. There are 181 dorm projects in the investment programme with 158,000 capacities. The scholarship, which is $470 a month in 2018, will be paid at $500 a month in 2019. In 2019, undergraduate students will receive $1,000 a month, and PhD students will receive 1,500 euro scholarships and loan payments. As of December 2018, our licensed athletes have been raised to 8 million 341,000, as a result of heavy work since 2003. Mr. President, we have increased our resources for health care as a power, and we have improved the quality of health care that we offer to our citizens, and we have made health care available to each and every one of our citizens. In our health care, we create programs focused on development, quality and sustainability in health care. The infant mortality rate and infant mortality rate, which is one of the developmental indexes in health, have been reduced rapidly due to the measures taken, while the expected life expectancy in childbirth has been increased from 72.5 to 78. In order to build functional and modern architectural health facilities and provide a high standard health care presentation for our citizens, we have co-operated with the community-private community and carried out urban hospitals projects. So far, we have opened city hospitals in Yozgat, Mersin, Isparta, Adana, Kayseri, Elazig, Eskişehir, and Manisa. Mr. President, we have done important work to strengthen the quality of our republic's legal state in every sense and to improve our democratic standards. In addition to the constitutional amendments, we have renewed all of our legislation, especially our basic laws. We have renewed important fundamental laws, including the Turkish Penal Code, in accordance with the needs of our country and the needs of the age, in accordance with the requirements of the democratic legal state. No one should have any doubt that we have a system of justice based on democratic values and respect for human rights. We have determined our vision in the field of justice as a reliable and accessible justice system. The fact that our justice system is moving forward requires constant change and development of the system. In 2002, we raised the number of courts, which were 3,581 in the judiciary, to 6,489 in 2018, to the number of courts that were 146 in the administrative court, to 195. With the operation of the district court and regional administrative courts, the Supreme Court and the State's workload has been reduced and the discrepancies have been resolved faster by a more effective trial. In addition, modern and answerable buildings were built instead of courthouses located in the basements. From 2002 to today, the construction of 253 service buildings has been completed. Mr. President, the valued lawmakers have become one of our largest foreign exchange sectors in our tourism sector, as a result of our investments in the conservation and strengthening of our natural and cultural resources and service sector during our AK PARTI administrations. In the coming period, we aim to be able to benefit more effectively from our country's tourism potential by focusing on alternative tourist areas such as health tourism, winter tourism, conference and fair tourism. In 2019, we will increase the number of tourists last year -- some 44 million -- but our main goal will be to increase the number of tourists, as well as tourism revenues. In terms of increasing our market share in tourism and creating the most accurate perception for Turkey, our promotional activities play a very important role. In this direction, the restructuring of the Turkish brand will be at the center of our promotional activities in 2019. Mr. President, valuable lawmakers, with our vision of national technology, strong industry, we speed up structural transformation in production to strengthen our industry's power and increase competition, and we spread production reform in a strong and balanced way across the country. We're implementing four of our main strategies, including high-velocity production, industrial efficiency increases, digital transformation and regional development. In order to reduce imports of interim goods in our export industry, we are launching the Uca Indianization Program. Localization, technology production and branding will be the main axis of high-increment value transformation, while RD and innovation will be supported. To ensure that, we support everyone from individual entrepreneurial candidates to major corporations to RD and innovation. We support our COSGEB and SME in many areas for domestic and national industry. Through TÜBITAK, we continue to side with national and original technologies with many projects and support programmes for the private sector. Our work on the commercialisation of patents, brands and designs has been accelerated. Since 2011, we have ranked first in Europe with more than 120,000 applications per year. On the other hand, with more than 45,000 applications, we are second in design in Europe. The application for over 12,000 local inventions was reached when it was evaluated with the Useful Model. Mr. President, the high-value lawmakers have seen agriculture as one of the primary sectors since we came to power, and we have given strong support to agriculture. The amount of support for the farmer will reach 14.5 billion TL by the end of the year. In 2019, we increase our support by 10.7 per cent compared to this year to a total of 16.1 billion TL. We allocate $21.4 billion to agriculture, including agricultural loan subsidies, intervention purchases, and financing of agricultural KİCE. We're transferring $26.5 billion to the agricultural sector, including agricultural investment funds. As part of field-based supports, we support diesel, chemical fertilizer, organic agriculture and good agricultural practices, support for nut producers and small family enterprises, five per cent and below. We completely removed the VAT, which was taken from fertilizer and bait. We told our farmers, yes, half of the mazot is yours, half is ours. So far, we've provided $17.3 billion for diesel and fertilizer. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] We support products that are strategically important and supply deficits for our country. We paid our farmers a total of $34 billion difference in 2003-2018, which is bonus support. As part of animal support, we have supported $28 billion from 2003 to today. Mr. President, we've given the local authorities more jobs and more responsibilities and more resources in order for local services to be presented in place, more efficient and quality. The total amount of funding from the 2019 budget to local governments has increased by 28.4 per cent from the previous year to about 94 billion dollars. We're building public gardens to make our cities a greener and more spacious habitat, to improve the quality of our cities' lives and environments, and to create identified cities. In the first hundred days, 33 people began working in the nation's garden. The five national gardens were completed as planned, and as you know, in November, we also opened Istanbul Kayaşehir, Başakşehir, Baruthane, Stripper and Hoşdere national gardens. With projects planned, our goal is to increase the amount of green per capita per capita in the first place by 10 per cent in Istanbul and 6 per cent in Ankara. Our work on the spread of the nation's gardens with 81 continues rapidly. In 2017, TİKİ gave the 2,092 families of martyrs and duty disability, and again in 2018 364 martyrs and the duty-designed family a non-interest mortgage. Mr. President, valued lawmakers, we've made significant progress in the energy sector in the time of AK PARTY power. In 2002, our power power force, which was 31,846 megawatts, increased by 177 per cent in the third quarter of 2018 to 88,347 megawatts. By the end of the year, the natural gas, which went to our five cities in 2002, will be delivered to the entire 81 counties and to more than 500 districts and cities. Turkey's acquisition terminal, starting with the Russian Federation, and continuing through the country to the border of neighbouring states, one of the Turkish Akım gas pipelines, each capable of carrying about 16 billion cubic metres of natural gas annually, has been completed and is scheduled to be operating at the end of 2019. We are conducting detailed seismic searches with our national ships for the discovery of hydrocarbon potential in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. After these seismic searches, we use the first multinational drilling ship to run deep and shallow sea drilling again on October 30, 2017. In addition to the conqueror, our second drilling ship will be included in our portfolio in early 2019. With these ships, we will follow an active strategy in the search for oil and natural gas by drilling separately in each of the Mediterranean and Black Sea. Dear President, we've spent about 537 billion dollars on transport, naval and telecommunications services from 2003 to the end of 2018. In our country, the number of interconnected cities has been increased from 6 to 76, from 6,101 km to 26,637 km; from 1,714 km to 2,842 km. The length of the tunnel has increased by nine stories and has increased from 50 kilometers to 463 kilometers. The rise in the standard of our roads has provided economic benefits that reach about 18 billion TL per year from the savings of fuel and labor. The high-speed line length in our country has reached 1,213 kilometers, and the number of passengers from these lines has reached about 44.1 million. In 16 years, the total maintenance and renovation of 10,982 kilometers of the 11.497km conventional line has been completed. The century-old dream of over 289 million passengers so far has been presented to our citizens as a mega-rail project. Turkey, located at the meeting point of the continents and bridges, including Asia, Europe and Africa, has been strengthened to become one of the most important lines in the world, with nearly 200 million passenger-accessed Istanbul Airport opened on 29 October 2018. In order to increase our country's activity in space and speed up the work in this field, we're setting up and operating the Turkish Space Agency. While supporting our trade with our major port projects in the marine area, the Canal Istanbul Project and I are opening the door to a major change in world sailing. Our number of shipyards has been increased from 37 to 78, to 6.86 billion TL, from 571, our Turkish-owned fleet of ships, to 1,511, our number of marinas, 62, our capacity to tie yachts from 8,500 to 18,545. Mr. President, the esteemed lawmakers, Turkey has gone to an important strategy change under our President's leadership in the fight against terrorism. Our fight against terrorist organizations has been transformed from incident-based operation to non-interruption operation, from defense to a new structure that we can describe as draining terror from its source. In this context, our struggle will not end until the end of terror. In 2018, 6,763 operations were carried out in the countryside to build a city of 87,699 in the so-called housing and base areas, while PKK-KCK in the city centers. In 2018, 352 terrorists surrendered. Besides, in 2018, 152 terrorists were able to meet their families and surrender through persuasion. The terrorist group's high-level casualties have been increased, 13 in 2018 have been neutralized by 104 so-called high-level terrorists, including 13 in the category of red. 2,648 people have been taken into custody and 854 others have been arrested in 2018 as part of 1,206 operations against the DEA terrorist organization that has been unable to act in our country since the beginning of 2017. The most critical of terrorist attacks is, of course, a bloody coup attempt by traitors from the terrorist organization who brutally attacked their own state and people with aircraft, tanks and weapons given to the Turkish Armed Forces inventory to protect their country on July 15th. In 21,893 operations this year, 47,778 people have been taken into custody and 9.140 others have been arrested. Mr. President, in order to eliminate the threat of the DEA, to ensure border security, to help Syrian immigrants return to their homes, and to prevent civilians in the region from being harmed by terrorism, the Free Syrian Army, supported by Turkish Armed Forces, was launched on August 24, 2016, and Operation Fırat Shield was completed on 29 March 2017. Operation Firat Shield was launched on January 20, 20, 20, 2018, to ensure the stability and security of both the borders of our country and the area of Afrin, to neutralize terrorists in the region, and to free the people of the region from the oppression and persecution of terrorists, and to neutralize more than 4,500 people of the PKK, PYD, YPG, and DEASK. On the other hand, the Astana Covenant has established 12 observation points in the area of Idlib to reduce tensions in order to monitor ceasefire violations, and construction activities of these observation points continue. As it is known, successful talks were held in Tehran, Sochi, and finally the Four Summit took place in Istanbul in September 2018, in order to reduce tension and prevent military intervention in Idlib. The application process of 635,392 of our citizens has been completed as part of the Bedelli military service, and the basic training of 67,591 has ended. Mr. President, valued lawmakers, we're working very hard to develop the Turkish defence industry. When we took office in 2002, we increased our independence in the field of defence industry by raising the domestic and nationality rate of 15 per cent to 65 per cent. And we're not done with it, we're not done with it, we're determined to go a lot higher than that. Our national and domestic products used in operations and counterterrorism operations in Syria are also an indicator of this independence. The exports of products designed and produced by our defense industry have also begun. We also sincerely believe that this will contribute to the development of high-tech and added products in our country. The exports of products designed and produced by our defence industry, which prove itself in the field -- as I have just expressed -- are being done and will continue to be done. Attack helicopters, Porcupines, Cobra II, Dragon Yalçin armor, submarine rescue, submarine amphibians and rescue, backup ships, armed and unarmed drones and SIHA (s) have been handed over to our security forces. The seismic and scientific research ship was handed over to Oruç Reis MTA. The tests of Bora, HESAR-A and HESAR-O missiles were successfully carried out. Mr. President, our country has also conducted humanitarian intervention and aid efforts to help people affected by disasters and emergencies, such as earthquakes, floods, droughts, famines, fires, fires, hurricanes and domestic disturbances, between 2009 and 18 continents, and 54 countries. About 2 billion US dollars have been spent in total for Turkey's international civil protection and humanitarian activities as part of these studies. According to the Global Humanitarian Aid Report 2018, Turkey was the most humanitarian aid country in 2017 with humanitarian aid of $8 billion of American dollars outside the country and the border. Turkey has been a country that has gained appreciation both in its region and in the world with its humanitarian foreign policy for the past 16 years. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] In particular, the world is greater than five. With its determination, our criticism of the distortions of the global system over the structure of the United Nations Security Council has echoed worldwide. Our honorable stand against the persecutions of our Palestinian brothers and attacks on Jerusalem's privacy, symbolised by the Davos meeting, also put our country in a different position. In the Syrian and Iraqi crisis, Turkey opened its door to all the oppressed and victims, regardless of any distinction, especially the Western countries. The total number of foreigners in our country has reached 4.7 million. 3.6 million of these are Syrian people whose love is temporarily protected, in their status. In recent weeks, images of various European cities, especially Paris, have also revealed the contradictions and hypocrisy of the West. Turkey is on its way to becoming the role model of the future, with the geography of the heart far beyond its physical limits. We have proved to the world by our operations in Syria that the steps to meet security concerns can also be taken by human sensitivities. From now on, we will continue to implement human-oriented policies in our region and in the world, which our ancestors, our history, our civilization, have pointed to us. In the case of Jamal Spooner, a journalist who was brutally murdered at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in early October, we took the last example of law and morality. Turkey's primitive stance on this subject has been appreciated by the world and prevented the cover-up of the murder. I'd like to rephrase here that we're not going to let this go until all the criminals are identified and brought to trial until we've carried out the order. The Syrian issue continues to remain on our agenda as the most vital foreign policy for the future of our country. As the state of Turkey and its nation, we are also proud to have successfully passed the human test by opening our hearts to the oppressed and the victims. Of course, the return of asylum seekers in our country is possible only if Syria regains peace, trust, and stability. Sadly, when we look at countries operating in Syria, which have not yet achieved their own internal integrity, we see that the countries outside of us have no such intention. Using terrorist organizations placed right next to our borders, the efforts of the Syrian crisis to export to our country have forced us to actually exist in the field. Turkey has defeated the DEAS in Operation Firat Shield, and has broken the PYD game in Operation Olive Dare. Thanks to the agreement we arrived with Russia in Idlib, which was supported by Iran, we were able to prevent a massive humanitarian crisis. Now, our agenda is to tear apart the corridor of terror that is being created east of Fırat. We're pushing the diplomatic routes to the end to resolve this matter. But the way these roads have turned into a diversionary tactic will force us, as our President would say, to cut our own belly once again. And we've made all the arrangements for that. On the other hand, we are making every effort to change the political solution of the talks launched in Astana, after the Geneva process was in a deadlock. I would like to say once again that the permanent solution to the Syrian issue is only possible with a new constitution and democratic elections that embrace all sections. Iraq is going through a critical phase because of sectarian fights, political disputes, and the intervention of various foreign forces. We're making all kinds of contributions to a solution to the territorial integrity and political unity of this country, and we're going to keep giving. Every development in Iraq, where we have deep historical ties and have very important cultural and commercial relations, is important to us. In the same way, we are conducting very important work in cooperation with the Iraqi government on the removal of northern Iraq from the separatist terrorist organization. Turkey is unable to be insensitive and reactive to any development in Iraq and Syria, which extends all across the southern borders. Every incident in Iraq and Syria is considered a matter of state and nation. With that understanding, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not, we did not. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Mr. President, good lawmakers, like our south, there's been a difficult process in geography. The tension between Russia and Ukraine has been a risk to the region. Turkey did not recognise Crimea's nature by Russia, and will not recognise it. We do not approve of other attacks on Ukrainian territorial integrity, sovereignty, and stability. We do every chance we get from Mr. President to his side in order to resolve the problems in the north of the Black Sea through peaceful means. Of course, Turkey's relations with Russia have a vastness and depth far beyond the developments in the Black Sea. In our achievements in Syria, the joint understanding union we have provided with Russia has been of great help. Again, we have reached a very good point with Russia on strategic energy projects for our country, particularly Akkuyu and Turkakım. We've come a long way in defense projects like S-400. We believe that developing our relations with Russia, which is our volume of over $20 billion a year, is in the best interest of both our country and our region. Turkey-American relations have been through a turbulent period recently. In fact, America has been one of our most important allies for many years."", ""Mr. President, dear lawmakers, I salute you with my deepest feelings, with respect, with conversation. I wish that the year of the Great National Assembly of Turkey, the year of the 27th term, the fifth legislature, along with this great institution, would be good for our country and our nation. From the establishment of our Parliament, which is the leader and co-director of the national struggle, I remember all members of our country who served as MPs. For those who have passed away from our parliament, who have left behind a century, I pray for God's mercy, health and pleasure for those who live. On this occasion, my older brother, Oğuzhan Nobleturk, who has died today, who has served as a minister of five years in the past, has taken important political responsibilities, and to God's mercy, and to his family, and to those who love him. I give thanks to all those who have taken possession of our country's legacy and future case, especially the first President of the Grand National Assembly and thebani of our republic, Veteran Mustafa Kemal. Since the victory of Malazgirt, I remember with mercy and gratitude our beloved martyrs and veterans who have fought with their lives to keep our presence in this land, where we have held our homeland with all our hands. With the same understanding, I wish success to our soldiers and security forces, all of whom my Lord will preserve and be victorious. Our council has been honored twice with the title of... but has not left the service to its country and its nation, no matter what the circumstances. On July 15th, just as in the National War, our Parliament did not allow dirty hands to touch this blessed land, this blessed roof. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] The sacrifices and efforts of your precious deputies, each serving their country day and night during the hard years of the law, are undoubtedly well recorded in history. Our nation now knows that if the lights of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey are on, if Parliament is working, if our MPs are on duty, God willing, this country will not have its back to the ground. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] I believe that every statement expressed on the assembly stand was expressed in the interest of the nation. Like every battle we've fought with his nation and his deputies, I believe we can reach our goal of building the great and powerful Turkey together, hopefully. In recent years, I have no doubt that our more productive Parliament will fulfill its responsibilities in reaching our 2023 goals and implementing our 2053 vision. I hope, for the first time in our history, that our offer to bring a new constitution to our country will be successfully carried out by our House. A new constitution, if possible, would be the best 2023 gift we can give our nation. For this, we expect the parties in the Turkish Grand National Assembly to share their new constitutional proposals with the public as soon as possible. We've started this initiative with the belief that we're responsible for the expedition, we're preparing for it, and ultimately, the decision and the decision is of the High Assembly. I'd like to thank all of you for supporting and contributing to this first constitutional proposal, which we intend to bring to our country by direct will. Dear lawmakers, when we came together last year for the opening of the new year of legislation, we expressed our support and prayer for our Azerbaijan brothers and sisters who fought here to save Karabakh (Karabakh) and their occupied territory. All praise be to Allah, who has fought forty-four days in the battle of Azerbaijan, which resulted in the victory of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan). Thus, the Azerbaijan lands, which have been occupied for nearly thirty years, and Karabak has been liberated again. By visiting Baku and Shusha in person, we shared the joys of our brothers from Azerbaijan. Hopefully, in the coming weeks, we'll be reunited with our Azerbaijan brothers. The developments during and after the battle of Karabuk have served as a turning paper for us as well as our Azerbaijan brothers. We will never forget the hatred and hatred of a country that struggles to save its occupied lands and support Turkey, and we will look to the future by making every experience we have a lesson. We are a country that values the integrity of brotherhood, friendship, friendship, solidarity, cooperation, cooperation, every step of the way. From Syria to Libya, from the Balkans to the Caucasus, from Somalia to Afghanistan, we act with the same understanding everywhere. While protecting our rights and interests in the Mediterranean, we supported the steps our Turkish Cypriot brothers took towards a two-state solution. In this regard, we have taken many important steps, especially the reopening of the closed Marash. We will continue to fight on all platforms for the protection of international agreement-based rights of Turkish and Muslim elements in Western Thrace. While defending the rights of our Crimean brothers on the basis of Ukraine's territorial integrity, we will also be followers of the vastst use of human rights by the Uygur Turks on the basis of the territorial integrity of China. We will keep our hearts wide open to all the people from Palestine and Jerusalem to Kashmir, from Rohingian Muslims to the people living under the security and poverty of Africa. Wherever there's an underdog, wherever there's a victim, we try to be there for them, and we show them. Praise be to the nation and country, there is no shame in colonialism, no shame in genocide, no shame in injustice and injustice in our past. That's why we go everywhere, with our foreheads stretched out, and we express our criticisms and our proposals in a very private way. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] This is the reason why our discovery of the United Nations Security Council has been so adopted that it has expanded in time to cover all the faults of the global system. Every development in our region and the world confirms the accuracy and accuracy of this discovery. The new Turkish house, which we recently inaugurated in New York, has taken its place in history as a glorious symbol of its position and architecture as a symbol of our country's entire approach to humanity. Our new Turkevi, our own citizens and officials, will serve with all our friends and brothers, including the Secretary General of the United Nations, who has joined with many of our guests. We are pleased to have given our country such a magnificent piece of work, which we have witnessed already boosting Turkey's international reputation. A thousand years ago there was a double-headed eagle on the crest of the state that made Anatolia a home for us, facing east and west, therefore embracing a vast geography. It is not right for anyone to try to sever the bond of love with Turkey's region, established on such an inheritance. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] We have all seen together how weak the international community is in the tenth year of Syria's crisis, when we left it behind, to govern both the actual intervention and human support and the flow of refugees. While Turkey alone opened its arms to 4 million losers, there were some who panicked in the face of a few thousand refugees who had reached its limits, leaving rights and law aside and exhibiting inhuman behavior. Almost every day, we meet people who are taken from their palms and tortured, drilled, left to die or forced to return. The owners of this inhumane attitude also violate the United Nations Convention on refugees and their decisions. As a matter of fact, the European Union has slowly begun to terminate its activities in order to oversee its work on refugee traffic in the region. In the dark waters of the Mediterranean, the statistics of how many thousands lost their lives on a journey of hope each year cannot be held. The fate of tens of thousands of refugee children lost in Europe remains unknown. In this regard, there is no significant effort or work except for the initiatives made by our deputies. Only these matters alone should be enough to raise up people with a conscience, morals, respect for people, to answer to those responsible. We also experience similar hypocrisy in the case of terrorist organizations in Syria. In particular, none of the people who ransacked the area on the excuse of DEAC have actually fought this organization. Only Turkey faced this dark organization in the field and soon blew up the balloon that was constantly inflated by someone. But some still continue to support terrorist organizations or a controversial regime with their people on the grounds of the DEA in Syria. Of course, we know that everyone here is trying to get their own agenda in the area under the guise of counterterrorism. To those who allow hundreds of thousands of people to die for this alone, millions of people to be driven from their homes, their homes, their homes, and their homes, to be driven into misery, it is our duty to stand by the truth and the right. (EC PARTY Applause) We have not been driven into a crisis of security or prosperity that we cannot overcome because we have done our human duty, but those who have come out of humanity with it have never found peace and will never find it. People who think that the world revolves around them, that everyone else is responsible for serving them, with every political and social turmoil, with every change in nature, they start to see that it's not the case. The famine in Africa will soon become clear that not only the inhabitants of it but all mankind have a common problem. The melting of glaciers in the Arctic will soon become clear that it is not only the penguins there, but all living things, especially mankind, that are the problem. The tragedy of people fleeing internal conflicts in the distant and remote corners of the world will be understood by time as a danger to everyone. The fact that no one lives in an absolute trust and prosperity fan, that everyone is a part of this great world, through the blessing and burden of everyone. In this photograph, Turkey has established a vision that will allow it to come to its rightful place in its region and in the world, by strengthening its democracy and development. The 2023 targets, which we have declared to be the 100th year of our Republic, will be the first stop in this vision. I believe with all my heart that our National Assembly will play a unique role in the formation of the century ahead. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] In the past 19 years, we have seen the great breakthrough in state and nation life from education to health, safety to justice, from transportation to energy as the basic infrastructure of this vision. From now on, this vision, which has been transformed from political to national targets, should be owned by all members of our country, starting with our Grand National Assembly of Turkey. Because there's no other Turkey for any of us, no more country for any of us, no more state for any of us, no more future for any of us. We must never take it out of our minds, that we cannot grow by division, that we cannot grow, that we do not grow, that we do not grow, that we do not become strong, that we do not root the brotherhood by fueling hostility, that we do not advance democracy by obsessing over obsessions, that we cannot deepen our horizons by giving up the values that make us who we are. The world's destination shows that we need to stick together, not our differences, but our partners. We follow the example of what happened to societies and countries who failed. They haven't been able to put Turkey in that position until now, and hopefully they won't be able to. (AC PARTY APPLAUSE) I give thanks to everyone who has worked hard in this success that we have achieved with the dignity, endurance, courage, heroism, and hard work of every member of our nation. On the other hand, one of the greatest services we've done to our country is to change our security strategies. Thanks to our new sense of security based on finding and destroying threats at its source, we have prevented a corridor of terror at the bottom of our borders. We have solved the Kurdish problem, which has been abused by every group, including terrorist organisations for years, with all its dimensions, from rights and freedoms to development. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] The same way we personally promised our citizens in Diyarbakır that we would eliminate rejection, denial, assimilation policies, the same way we have broken the chain of backwardness, we will bring down the masks of those who still want to make this a subject of abuse. So we started a period when the mothers of Diyarbakir were able to shake the terror organization with their glorious resistance and reveal the true faces of their political extensions. On this occasion, I salute the Mothers of Diyarbakir once again. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Dear lawmakers, Turkey has come today as a country that has missed its industrial revolution, trying to grow from the edge of the information and technology revolution. The world is now on the eve of a new and radical transformation, where we see many examples in history. From climate change to artificial intelligence, we have very important advantages to capture this new revolution, where many complex elements are combined. In the last 19 years, when we add the multidimensional tests that we've been experiencing over the last eight years, to the distance our country has traveled in democracy and development, it's a promising picture for all of us. Every critical test we've had, every new opportunity and success we've had, means the distance we've traveled towards a bright future for us. As a country and a nation, hopefully, we will not miss this new change in the global system, but reach the levels we target in every field. In these tests, no doubt, the economy has its own significance and place, as well as all other breakthroughs create the driving force. In the past 19 years, we are responsible for the economy, as is every gain that Turkey has gained. In May 2013, we completed our country's $23.5 billion debt to the IMF, and ended a period when we did not remember it with such pleasant memories. Our central bank reserve, which someone constantly asks, has reached the level of 122 billion dollars. When we look back from the past, we see a Turkey that has tripled its national income, which has risen to 11th place in the world according to the acquisition party; in investment, in production, in exports, in employment, in growth. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] We're not forgetting, of course, that the problems we've been experiencing lately are in the same picture, but when we do a pros and cons analysis, we expect that our pros are too much to compare. With that understanding, I'd like to share with you a current economic assessment. As we have all witnessed, the world has been struggling with problems caused by the global epidemic for the past two years. We're going through a much deeper, much more destructive and transformative period than the world wars of the past century or the burdens of previous global crises. In political, social, and economic life, what we know is right, what we're used to is fundamentally shaken. There are sharp increases in commodity prices, especially in products in the basic defining position of the global economy, and shortages in supply chains continue to be narrowed down in access to raw materials and critical products. As unemployment continues to exist as a global problem, budget deficits and debt rates have reached historical levels in many countries. We're at a time when the supply demand balance has been disturbed, the threat of inflation has increased globally, the uncertainty is increasing. The institutions, such as the IMF and the World Bank, are in serious management crisis. There are questions about the neutrality and transparency of the economic analysis of the global institutions we've been exposed to for a long time, which now puzzles everyone. In a way, the Covid-19 virus also exposed the world-wide diseased and unfair political and economic order. Turkey is one of the few countries that have managed to stay strong during this difficult period, even boosting its power. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Dear lawmakers, at such a critical time, it is imperative that we open up some truths with power and opposition and set our road map for the future accordingly. First of all, the fact that this outbreak did not occur in Turkey and that our country has suffered the effects of a world-shattering crisis. Another fact is that our country successfully manages this major health crisis and the aftershocks following it through the quick and effective decision-making, implementation, conversion ability of the presidential government system. All services for our citizens in the field of health have been provided without delay and without fail. In particular, the city has provided us with the extraordinary burden of our hospitals to be able to get into the system with high capacity and vast resources. From access to the hospital and the doctor to intensive care and respiratory care, from masking and cleaning supplies to vaccinating, there has been no significant shortcomings, distress, collapse in our country. In most developed countries, scenes that really hurt their conscience because they were caught unprepared for the epidemic because of poor health systems, because their capacity for hospital and equipment was inadequate. We are pleased to receive the fruit of our investments in our country's health infrastructure and human resources with all its elements during such a global crisis. On the other hand, every positive and negative process we've had in the last eight years has been reflected in the economy that I don't need to count once more, but you all know very well. And that's when we faced the plague. As we took every precaution to protect our nation's health, we mobilized our resources to ensure that it maintains its work, its vaccine, its structure. We've taken measures against all sectors to ensure the survival of the Turkish economy, the continuous production, the protection of employment. We've been on the side of our citizens and firms with many different supports to the labour market. We've given grants, rent and turnover support to our tradesmen and artists. We've brought delays to pay taxes and social security benefits. We've made it possible for public debt to be structured. We've given discounts on VAT and rental outages. With all this, we've sustained the most vulnerable parts of society with social support payments. From now on, we will continue to take part in the need, in the presence of each section, and provide the necessary support. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Thanks to this policy that we've been following, we've been separated from many countries around the world in a positive way, closing last year with growth. I would also like to make a comparison to be much more dramatic: You remember that in 2009, when there was a serious global economic crisis, both the world and Turkey's economy were shrinking. Last year, the shrinking of the global economy was much more severe than 2009, and there was a narrowing of over 3 percent. In contrast, Turkey has achieved 1.8 per cent growth. Of course, we didn't leave that success in 2020, but in the first quarter of this year, 7.2 per cent and the second quarter, we caught a 21.7 per cent growth rate. Investments and net exports have contributed greatly to growth. So we're a little closer to our goal of stable and sustainable growth. Economic developments in the third quarter of the year continue live, with the help of strong industrial production and export and improvement in the service sector. Hopefully, we'll be able to close the 2021 with a growth of 9 percent. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] The growth is accompanied by an increase in employment. In the first seven months of this year, the increase in employment reached 1.7 million people, while in total employment, we left pre-infected levels behind. Turkey is one of the number of countries among the OECD countries to increase employment according to the pre-infected period. We've also set our next road map in our mid-term program. During the programme period, we aim to increase average 5.3 per cent year-on-year, employ 1.2 million people each year, increase our national income to over $1 trillion. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] We're actually happy to finally achieve these goals that we've been trying to achieve, even though we've been through so much before, with a bit of delay. It is critical to us that the quality of growth we will receive, stability, revenue distribution, justice, and new jobs for our young people. For this, we will act decisively, with the economic reform programme and the medium-term programme. Dear lawmakers, it is possible that Turkey will take the easy breath we desire in the economy, but by increasing investment, production, exports, employment, it will quickly increase the current deficit to excess. We've reached the best levels of our history in exports, the most important tool of this. Our exports put $210 billion a year behind us, while our exports have come to a pretty good place to meet our imports. Without a doubt, the success of Turkish industry is behind this development in exports. Our industry is rapidly adapting to innovations, increasing its sectoral diversity day by day with its highly dynamic and capable structure. So it turns out we're going to be way above the $211 billion export target we set for 2021. Thanks to strong exports, recovery tourism revenues, and our arrangements for gold imports, a significant improvement has begun in current balance. During the epidemic, global investments were reduced by 35 percent, and it barely slowed us down. At this time, we opened the largest city hospitals in Turkey, two emergency hospitals with 1,008 beds, which we had made available in Istanbul in 45 days. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] We have also completed numerous investments in the epidemic, such as roads, highways, railways, bridges, tunnels, dams, drinking water and irrigation facilities, factories, defence industry projects. Our private sector has continued its investments in its field uninterrupted. The 10,449 investment incentives issued last year are one of the most important signs. The number of organised industrial zones increased to 325, with 14 new locations completed last year. Production has begun in 12 percent of the industrial regions, and work has been under way at the top of the 11th. Just by these steps, we've established the infrastructure that will contribute $25 billion to the recovery of our current deficit. Thanks to the dynamics of our private sector and the stability of our economic policies, I believe we can completely get rid of the current problem at this time. For that, we want to increase the scale of international investments in our country. In particular, we take every opportunity to encourage our own entrepreneurs to bring global brands to our country, which have not yet invested in Turkey. So by turning our investment incentives into a much more attractive structure, we will bring selective support, including cash incentives. We will provide more support for investments in the new system that are based on equity and in line with regional clustering priorities. We are preparing to create new mechanisms for the integration of our COBIs into global supply chains. We aim to bring our country to a global state in the emerging areas of the future, as well as the defence industry, biotechnology and health industries. Last weekend, we met again in TEKNOFEST, with all generations, especially our young people who were keen on science, research, innovation. We've seen firsthand how our young people who attend our country's greatest technology festival raise the bar every year. Hopefully in the new era, we'll grow our investment, production, export and employment infrastructure by folding it by the hands of these young people. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Of course, we don't ignore the inflation issue when we say all that. Unlike developed countries, Turkey is not the first country to face inflation. So we have a lot more experience and tools in fighting inflation effectively. We are determined to reduce inflation to one-digit figures by taking many steps from macroeconomic policies to structural reforms. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] We're taking measures to reduce both drought and increased input costs on the food side. One of them is the early warning system, which will instantly detect and allow for intervention. We've also taken into account our competitive policies. We're going to be determined on companies that are disrupting the competition, misusing the situation of the judge in the market, and setting the prices in an arbitrary manner. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] Dear lawmakers receive the power of Turkey's economy from a sound financial sector and a disciplined public finance. The active size of our banking sector reaches 6.7 trillion liras, while the capital efficiency rasio is 17.4 per cent and the conversion rate is 3.7 per cent. Creating a sustainable production structure requires stronger support from the real sector, especially the SMEs, by the financial sector. Likewise, I believe our banking sector will lead the way for funding abroad for the sustainable transformation of our real sector. We want to make the banking sector more efficient and the capital markets stronger. We expect our companies to reduce their dependence on the banking sector and provide long-term financing for their investment through capital market tools. To that end, we're developing market infrastructure by increasing product diversity in our capital markets. In order to encourage the real sector's financing from capital markets, we are implementing the Tahvil Guaranteed Fund, and the Green Bond and Sukuk Guide to finance sustainable environmental projects under better conditions. We continued our strong position in the public finances without compromise during the outbreak. We've determined the national rate of the budget deficit to be 3.5 per cent, especially this year and next year. This year, trade supports, vaccines and medical supplies purchases, short-work grant bonus loss payments, expenses for disasters, paybacks to our civil servants and pensioners for inflation have put pressure on the budget deficit. We've taken measures to ease the burdens that these additional costs bring into the budget. Resuscitation in economic activity also boosted performance on the income side. Thus, the 3.5 per cent budget deficit at the end of the year is clear that we will be able to reach our goal. By reducing the budget deficit, we've strengthened the debt supply as we reduce the need for debt. Our European Union-defined General Management Stock is well below 60 per cent of Maastricht Criteria, which is the proportion of our national income. We will continue to implement a cautious and cautious debt management policy, taking into account the steps taken by the central banks of other countries. We will continue our policy of keeping our cash reserves strong in order to prepare for foreign fluctuations. Dear lawmakers, one of the things that is increasingly prominent in the world's agenda is environmental problems and the disasters caused by climate change. We've already moved our country to a different place in our faith, in our roots, and in our culture, with strong environmental sensibilities. In particular, every project we've done through our Ministry of Environment and Urbanism has been recorded as our country's face-blown work on the environment. The nation we see as a windpipe to our cities, we have given our country countless works and services from our gardens to our forest existence, from our Zero Waste Project to the Blue Flag practices. Our decision to present the Paris Climate Agreement, which we announced last week at the United Nations General Assembly, is also the first good news of the Green Development Revolution, which we started. From now on, Turkey will plan and implement every step it takes with that understanding. In harmony with the Green Covenant of Europe, we are determined to carry out our responsibility to humanity, to our citizens, and to future generations. In this context, we're going to increase the rate of renewable energy sources in our total power by weighting solar, wind, nuclear production. We'll speed up our investments in gas supply, production and storage. We will, hopefully, launch the first stage of our current nuclear power plant in Akkuyu, in May 2023, and take the necessary steps to build new power plants. [[AC PARTY APPLAUSE]] In the industry, we're going to focus on high-tech infrastructure that will reduce energy density, but we're going to encourage applications with low emissions and clean production techniques at a weight. We're going to increase the rate of electric and hybrid vehicle use in transport to increase the cargo and passenger transport of the railroad and the sea road. We're going to make sure that all the buildings have energy IDs, and we're going to expand the zero-energy building standard. We will strengthen production, supply, recycling systems, especially measures to reduce food waste in agriculture. We'll double the capacity of important swallowing resources such as forest and water, then triple it. We're going to expand the zero waste application to within the range of all domestic waste, diversifying the use of recycled materials. The reason why we are subject to these obligations, each of which requires serious work and sacrifices, is because we see this issue as a global security issue for ourselves and all of humanity. We will use all international resources, especially the funds of developed countries, to finance investments in this direction. We are now entering a phase of risk management, along with search, rescue, and reconstruction of disasters. We're going to improve our risk management plans in connection with climate change. We're going to set up a comprehensive early-warning system against meteorological events that are becoming increasingly unstable and rigid. We're going to develop new projects for the transfer of our fertile water resources to the drier parts of our country. Using drones, planes, helicopters, and other means of action, we will strengthen our role model position around the world in the fire that burns our hearts along with the forests. We're going to review the infrastructure and planning of our cities based on this new reality, and we're going to start preparing for the rehabilitation of the present and the standard of the new. We'll move immediately to create effective use of increasingly valuable water sources and infrastructure consistent with climate changes. We're going to promote sustainable techniques in agriculture and livestock. We're going to turn forestry activities into climate change. We're going to plan and implement actions in every field from health to tourism. So, I believe we're going to take this most important and ambitious goal of our 2053 vision step by step. We believe that the new process, which we refer to as the Green Development Revolution, deserves to be taken over by parties. Among the things that we will focus on with precision in the coming period are strengthening the family institution, developing our educational system. Hopefully, when it comes to these matters, we'll discuss them, discuss them, and establish our road map together with our House, as well as our other institutions, and other relevant sections when it comes to them. With such feelings, once again, I wish the Great National Assembly of Turkey's 27th Year of the Fifth Legislature to the best of all. I wish our MPs the best of luck with their work in this new year of law enforcement. I give you all my love, my respect. Peace be with you.""]","<|system|>

7,1302,7_syriza_democracy_political_eur,"['syriza', 'democracy', 'political', 'eur', 'economy', 'tax', 'citizens', 'tell', 'however', 'investment']","['syriza', 'democracy', 'political', 'eur', 'economy', 'tax', 'citizens', 'tell', 'however', 'investment']","['The government plan for strategic development for the future, which you made public yesterday, ladies and gentlemen of the government, is revealing what the Greek people have to expect the next day. The three main axes of this plan are, firstly, for tax policy. Promise that you will reduce corporate taxation to attract investment and increase their profitability. What different, really, are you saying from the New Democracy programme? You will, in fact, be even more burdening the people\'s strata to shield the competitiveness of different monopolistic groups. That is why you are not committed anywhere to reducing indirect taxation and you are not talking about the people\'s tax burden and the ENPI. The declaration on the extension of the tax base and the fight against tax evasion from the moment the freedom of movement of capital and the various secrets remains, is, in fact, preparing for a new tax raid on self-employed workers, on free trade. Secondly, on the labour market. The proclamation of more and better jobs is a wish without any real objection, since you do not intend to abolish any Memorandum Law than those that have led to the ever greater liberalisation of the labour market, the demolition of complex labour and insurance rights. Besides, any changes in the labour market you tell us that they should take into account the impact on growth, productivity and competitiveness, that is, what you always do. In this reasoning, which proposes capitalist profitability, the government sees and the redefinition of the minimum wage, which will, of course, be combined with the compression of the average wage. The Government also clearly commits that facilitating the return to the labour market goes through further support for the various projects offering cheap labour to groups with programmes through OADs. Thirdly, the famous social orientation of government policy is exhausted in the initiatives of social entrepreneurship and cooperative projects. The truth is that the notorious social and solidarity economy is already being exploited by your state as a mechanism to reduce social security benefits by transferring the responsibility of a number of activities to it, leading to further trade, to privatization of these services, which, of course, are paid only by the people. It is valued as a mechanism for completely temporary deportation and mocking our people, covering up great unemployment with hunger wages. It works as an additional lever of worsening working relationships and further increase the degree of exploitation with the so-called, otherwise infamous, \'voluntary work\' - we put it in introductory terms, because other things are the real voluntary work and assistance and solidarity that workers can give - that is, with extended hours, the low wages of workers in it, in the name of the social character of these activities. Ladies and gentlemen, today\'s debate is particularly revealing. It shows how far the convergence of urban parties has gone on in the capital strategy - the three main parties have already spoken - which constantly calls for sacrifices from the people to stabilise the recovery of their profits. This deep agreement to continue the anti-grass attack to shield the competitiveness of monopolies, both trying to hide SYRIZA and New Democracy and PASOK, which was renamed the Change Movement, with election, the climate of artificial polarization and Scandalism. And lately we have the attack on Boutaris. There is no doubt that this is an unacceptable event, an unambiguous attack on the Mayor of Thessaloniki, which we have denounced since the first moment, and this position we have also taken on a firm footing with the Municipality Council of Thessaloniki and Athens and everywhere where the subject arises. And that, in our view, has had to be the case, but that\'s as far as we\'re concerned. This sentence may not be accompanied by the ‘a’ or ‘b’ views or positions of that mayor, if we agree or disagree, and this may be a criterion. Nor can we make use of the announcement of condemnation, condemnation of this unacceptable event, to put our views from the door on the so-called democracy that each one of you believes, ""for the extremes"", even to make unscrupulous comparisons with the peace hero Gregory Lambraki and go by saying. Much more cannot take advantage of this fact, for a set-up bipartite fight than what you have used to us. We have also seen this from the side of the New Democracy and from the side of the Prime Minister, SYRIZA, the ANELs. And we\'re talking about a structured two-party game, not talking about the third memorial you\'ve all voted for together. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen of the government, be serious at one time, because the Prime Minister may say that he is incubating the spike egg, but a few months ago SYRIZA\'s government MPs and Mr. Kammenos, the co-pilot, with the evangelizer Cassidy, took a picture of murder. Kastelorizo. These are results and snakes you incubate. Three and a half years you are now in governance, and it lasts, of course, and without end, the Nazis\' trial, at the time you had to end the the theories of the two ends, the ""we condemn violence"", generally and abstractly, wherever other things come from, that give an alibi to the monsters of Naziism. Because it has nothing to do with claiming the right of the working people, for example the strike, the class struggle, which sometimes takes stronger, more upward forms, with terrorist, fascist, racist violence, with the provocative anti-semitists, various anarchists, to tell them so, or with the violence of the state mechanisms of repression. Of course you don\'t get enough of this, you\'re over it. We now have the debate on the famous \'national negotiating line\' with lenders. All of us here hide that, on the one hand, the so-called lenders, the European Union, the IMF and the Greek urban order of capitalists are walking hand and, on the other hand, they have a common interest in continuing to dismantle the working people, the popular strata, like all the other Member States, not only Greece but all the countries of the European Union. All of you, we say, went bankrupt with the New Democracy and the PASOK, Mr Tsipras, gentlemen of the SYRIZA - ANEL government. So you can\'t take your tail out. You are all hiding that the infamous negotiation is not being conducted in order to ensure popular prosperity but in order to create an appropriate compromise for interests between competitive urban classes. There can be no national negotiating line, because there are actually two Greeks with opposite interests. There is Greece of the great capital and Greece, on the other hand, of the working class, of our people. This is the truth that the government propaganda, Mr Tsipras\' story, which talks about the country\'s net exit from the lenders\' commission and the opportunity that will arise for the purpose of philolosophical social policy from the continued recovery of capitalist profitability and the favourable regulation of state debt. It really needs a great deal of political courage to talk about the end of the committee, when everyone knows that Greece is, on the one hand, subject to the strict rules in force in all the Member States of the European Union, about the restrictions on budgetary policy and, on the other, it is well known that there is a process of enhanced supervision on specific terms for the Member States that have borrowed by the European Support Facility. It makes no sense to mention in detail the known procedures, such as the European semester, namely the monitoring of the drafting and implementation of the single budget of each State, and the declarations of all the relevant players on the expected strict framework of the European Union\'s memorandum of supervision. What matters to understand, however, is that even if there were not all these strict procedures, they are the same objectives of the domestic ruling class, which require that workers continue to undone, that cheap labour should be extended, that state spending on social policy should be cut down to recover and increase their own profitability. Let\'s leave the lenders for a while, and let\'s see what BSE is asking here in Greece for the next period. Of the most official lips, BSE calls for a new reduction in the so-called non-wage cost, and it states that no kind of retreat should be made to the anti-virtual, legislative framework that has been launched in the previous period. Calls for new, diverse state support for capitalist profitability, reducing taxation for large businesses, reducing energy costs, providing investment incentives and cheaper lending for entrepreneurs. It calls for new regulations to facilitate the licensing and placement of big business. In this direction, the current SYRIZA government has already committed itself to the hundreds of laws and measures that it has adopted and which will be implemented in the coming years, as well as the agreement that is preparing to conclude, on the anti-popular policy that will continue. What needs to be understood is that the policy of the memorandum is not a Greek originality that escapes from this other notorious European regularity. It has, in fact, specified the European Union\'s policy, which deepens the exploitation of workers to shield only the competitiveness of the groups in the European Union, which is why it applies in all the Member States of the Union. That is why in Portugal too, you have it and you advertise it that came out of the memorandum at any rate, 70% of the pensioners and get a pension under 450 euros. That is why in France, which has no troika and quartet, there is no memorandum, sectoral collective agreements are undermined and redundancies are released. This truth is trying to hide the fair development tale, which will benefit both the perpetrators and the victims of capitalist exploitation at the same time. That is why we are talking about the political courage of Mr Tsipras, who, as far as we approach the elections, dares to talk about the need to strengthen workers\' negotiating power, while even having voted to undermine the right to strike. The greatest practical demonstration of the convergence strategy of the different parties is the continuous transformations of the PASOK into titles and programmes, which ensure that it can collide with both SYRIZA and New Democracy. Of course, this is not a very special Greek phenomenon, as long as we take a look at Germany and other European countries. The anti-popular history of European social democracy is particularly teaching for all. In order to understand today\'s political conflict better and deeper, however, we also need to start with the international economy and Greece. The international economy, the capitalist economy, seems to be entering a new recovery phase. Global gross product increased by 3.8% in 2017 with a significant increase in world trade. In the European Union, in the euro area, GDP has risen by 2.4% and is the largest increase in the last decade. But the intrinsic problem of capitalism in the world remains. The size of the over-accumulated capital internationally has acquired record dimensions. A huge amount of capital can\'t find a profitable investment way out. The profit rate remains extremely low. The size of interest rates throughout the world bears witness to the truth. At the same time, the total government debt at global economic level remains in the dimensions of avalanche. The possibility of a new capitalist crisis going deeper and more synchronised is threatening capitalist development, thus increasing the possibility of dangerous plans being adopted as an alternative to the system for a more generalised imperialist war. The Greek capitalist economy went through a recovery phase. GDP in 2017 ended with a positive growth rate of 1.4%, although below the projection of 1.6%. It is expected to be positive for both 2018 and 2019. Of course the government hides that this weak, perhaps even unstable recovery or development as you say it, is and will also be painted with new sacrifices of workers and retired people. Today, you as a government and otherwise your urban counterpopulation will try as long as you can cover the real anti-popular goals of the ruling class in this new phase in which the economy enters. Ladies and gentlemen, the uncertainty of global development, the BREXIT and the exacerbation of the conflicts in the European Union, the escalating trade war in the United States and their consequences in the domestic economy make a medium-term growth precarious. And the domestic bourgeoisie is part of the competition. This is reflected in its aim of creating a favourable framework for attracting investment and the objective of a genuine geopolitical upgrading of the country. And since we want to speak with examples, it is worth seeing what restructuring your friends are calling for through the President of BSE. So the BSE crisis has explained to us the need to become an investment boom in the Greek economy, to attract new investments of several billion euros over the next few years. It has explained to us which areas it considers appropriate to make this investment leap, but above all it has focused on the reforms that need to be carried out so that all this can be done. The hesitant Greek investors must feel safer in Greece and, in order to do this, BSE has already indicated what to do. Of course, the BSE suggestions for the necessary anti-grass reforms are covered in a very wicked language, as always. But their contents are so clear that no one can really cover it. So let us see what BSE is asking for and what BSE means by developing the objectives of the reform programme that big companies need. Bovine spongiform encephalopathies are also being used as a means of preventing the spread of the disease. What does he mean? Basically, the need to maintain the entire anti-legislative framework that has been launched during the crisis. BSE refers to the need to reduce so-called non-wage costs. What does he mean? It refers to the reduction of employers\' contributions, the reduction of allowances, the reduction of pensions. The BSE crisis is talking about reducing energy costs for businesses. And how can this be done, at the same time as your policy by increasing the share of renewable energy sources leads to a surge in electricity production costs rather than by shifting this burden to the popular layers? Do you see any other way? Your BSE friends are talking about investment incentives in business. What else do they mean by means of new development laws that fuel tens of billions of euros the profitability of groups, mainly resulting from tax raids on employees and pensioners? Mr. Tsipras, ladies and gentlemen of the government, the demands of BSE are not a simple blessing to the bourgeoisie. You\'re doing your job very well, which has of course become your job. You have already committed yourself, that you will reduce pensions further in the next period, as requested by BSE. You have already committed yourself, that you will increase the tax on employees and self-employed professionals, to create greater surpluses, so that you can fund businesses, as requested by BSE. You are aggressingly pushing the privatisations to get the big investments, as the BSE demandes. You are preparing changes in state interventions to serve more effectively and with fewer stumbling blocks, as the BSE demandes. You have committed yourself to monstrous primary surpluses for decades, which will come from the workers\' pockets. You\'re trying to convince the workers that memorial regularity will be different from their miserable present. You\'re lying to them. The measures of the first eighteen memorandum months are already adopted. New taxes that reach up to 500 euros the head. New active pension cut, followed by the following. You have dissolved PPC in order to facilitate private investment and speed up the liberalisation of energy. You have set yourself as your task to convince the workers that by the end of the memoranda the regularity will return, that things will get better. Who are you kidding? Surely you can no longer make fun of the Greek people. You cannot hide that, for example, your science friend McCron in France, at the heart of Europe\'s normality, dismantles labour relations, abolishes trade union representation, reduces the taxation of large enterprises. The policy of the cheapest labour force in support of capital profitability in the aged capitalist world is common throughout the European Union. All over the European Union, the retirement thresholds are increasing and moving forward towards an aggressive slaughter of rights. Some conquests for working women have also been levelled in the name of equality. Nor can you hide that your European regularity is plagued by escalating contradictions that directly threaten not only cohesion but even the very existence of the European Union. Unequal growth within the European Union is the opening of the lane between German, French and Italian groups - to focus on some larger economies - leading to a disparity of interests between them. France and Germany are colluding for the future of the European Union and the nature it will have. In Italy, the debate on the future of the euro has returned to the news, while in general the European Union is divided into individual groups, with special interests, the \'North\', the \'Visegrad Group\', France, which often cannot agree to each other except in the elementary. These oppositions have a catalyst for geopolitical opposition, the trade war which the United States of America has waged against China and Russia and the US\'s attempt to influence the European Union. Of course you are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the measures with which you are ‘friendly’ to workers without stopping have a dramatic effect. You\'ve been kicking the workers, the populace. Despite your ambitious efforts to cover it up, unemployment is plagued by popular strata. Its actual rate remains much above your advertised 20% if you calculate flexible employment relationships, part-time work, a few hours a week\'s work. As much as you are trying to hide it, over your days you have achieved over 50% of the new recruitments for parttime and rotating work. At the same time, only 10% of unemployed are entitled to unemployment benefit. You must feel proud, Mr. Tsipras, gentlemen of SYRIZA - ANEL. The \'first time on the left\' breaks our people. Even with ELSTAT\'s data, the poor are more than two million thousand, while in extreme poverty they live almost half a million people. The tax-payer you\'ve orchestrated has led half the people to owe tax and the number of forced recovery measures to more than a million. Large companies paid a low, symbolic sum, less than EUR 2 billion, that is less than 5% of government revenue. You must be proud to advertise the monstrous surpluses that have come because you are depriving the unemployed of the unemployment benefit. You\'re robbing the workers, reducing all social costs. But not everyone loses your policy. Large businesses continue to be systematically strengthened. Your period of governance is typical. The development law you\'ve introduced is causing. You support capital with new tax exemptions and aids, special provisions on rapid licensing, with particular emphasis on exporting enterprises, in the priority areas for large capital. The level of taxes paid by legal persons is reduced, despite the fact that they already give literally crustaceans. Auctions take the form of an avalanche. And they may in most cases relate to debts and loans to banks, but the municipalities have been able to make out in the hammer real estate and movable assets related to workers, people\'s families, debts arising even from a call from the Municipal Police. The elements of the Municipality of Patras are characteristic. A total of forty-four thousand Patricks owe the municipality 120,000,000 euros. 55.5 million owes them only two hundred four big businessmen with debts of more than EUR 50,000 and the rest of the others together, that is more than a hundred forty - three thousand. Of these two hundred four businessmen who owe the municipality - they owe more than EUR 50 000 each - little can be collected. What for? Because they are anonymous corporations, which are shielded by the laws in force, have shut down their businesses and therefore you can\'t get anything. The anonymous companies are dying, but the owners there live and reign, as Mayor Patras denounces. The one left unprotected is the one who doesn\'t have. That is what we are saying that they must be protected by deleting debts or by facilitating their repayment over time especially for long-term unemployed people in the CRL. The JRC is tabling a legislative amendment on this issue and it concerns the inhabitants not only of Patras but of all the country and of all the municipalities. Here, then, is Rhodes, gentlemen of the government and of the counterpopulation, and let go of the big words. Your policy, gentlemen of the government, is not accidental. Move on the tracks required by the groups to ensure profitability. That is why the New Democracy and the Change Movement are not entitled to criticise you. It is no coincidence that you are struggling with the New Democracy today in order to find real differences in what you are proposing. The policy of cheap labour force, the support of capital with tax exemptions, the reductions in rates, the promotion of privatisations, the so-called state modernisation and prudent financial management is your common place with New Democracy. It is no coincidence that the political bosses in the BSE, SYRIZA and New Democracy are grouping you together. They talk about Tsipras and Mitsotakis and talk about wise politicians. Government and urban counter-population are the two sides of the same anti-population currency and the so-called reformed PASOK, the Change Movement, in a way that confirms with today\'s pre-dated discussion that he has asked for. He admits that he also discusses his role as a government crutch, with his positions objectively, either with SYRIZA or with New Democracy. He testifies to the strategic conclusion of these parties for the interests of capital, for the geopolitical upgrading of the country. The government is, of course, currently taking on the role of a flagship in NATO. It turns the country into a huge base of the United States, the Atlantic imperialist alliance, from Alexandroupolis and Larissa to Araxos and Souda. I would like to say here that the information published today by the \'RIZOPASTI\' that on 17 May he visited the Araxos air base, Fred Fredrikson Head of NATO\'s nuclear policy and firmly defender of the infamous naval doctrine of the first nuclear blow. I would remind you of the complaints we have made and from this step back in the past that the upgrading work at the Araxos base is referring to a hosting of special weapons even nuclear weapons. But even if this visit was just a routine visit, as it spread, a planned inspection, it is confirmed that Greece over SYRIZA - ANLE remains an integral party of the most dangerous projects of the United States of America and NATO, such as its nuclear strategy. In addition, not only are there facilities in which nuclear weapons could be stored but also often - very densely, as the ""RIZOPASTI"" has revealed - exercises are carried out on the basis of corresponding items, while despite what is said, it seems that in a number of infrastructures of the Greek Armed Forces throughout the country, occasionally, nuclear weapons have been stored in the United States, with the Greek Armed Forces taking up security or assistance missions elsewhere. That is why we say that the government\'s policy puts you people at the forefront of major competitions in the event of a major race in the region. Ladies and gentlemen, precisely because your concentration on the main issues, on the objectives of great capital is given, it is expressed, you are all looking for individual disorientation moves to diversify you, to highlight the call line \'progress - maintenance\', \'new - old\', \'destruct - incorrupt - incorruptible\' and it is not assembled. Your proposals have nothing good anymore, nothing new to the Greek people, and the closer you get to the elections, the stronger the tone, the promotional spots, the ridiculous coconut battles, the election promises without any opposition. That\'s why you\'re confused about the fox and the hangers, Mr. Tsipras. You, gentlemen of SYRIZA - ANEL, have been rounded to the chair of power in recent years and you do not want to be moved from it, you are born to it. The others, the New Democracy and the PASOK, have had a withdrawal syndrome since their absence from this chair. ""One face, one race"" you are. You have no alternative. Your proposals are within the walls of this barbarity of the system, in the service of a class that has everything and exploits the Greek people, in the service of your international allies, who unravel our people for their own interests and will lead them to the slaughterhouse unfortunately of the war, as they have done many times in the past. The alternative lies only in creating the conditions for the working class to come to power, but in reality. Greece has rich production sources, has huge growth of science, technology, concentrated production instruments, numerous, experienced technician, scientific workforce, agricultural production capacity, coverage of all modern folk needs with socialized, of course, production, with a centralized scientific plan of the economy, services. So only it can really walk along the path of friendship, solidarity, cooperation with all the peoples of the region, Europe, the world, with peace and prosperity for our people. Thank you.', 'So we asked the Greek people\'s mandate to continue with a great effort with the same objective: to set the country back on its feet, to get away from the comitology that the bankrupt governments of the old political regime have put into us and to get out of the crisis. You keep talking about the language of truth, and I wonder, which government would you dare? We had first elections with\'money there\', a memorandum. No thoughts of appealing to the People\'s verdict. The same happened with the second one. We have, however, taken this political option and asked the Greek people to admit that we did not achieve what we would like, but by telling him that we now have an agreement, which, despite the fact that it is difficult, can be implemented for the first time without condemning the economy in the recession and society in a lasting hostage. Our commitment to the Greek people in September, a few months ago, was that we will implement this agreement, but we will not retreat to new irrational requirements, that we will protect, by exploiting the flexibility that this agreement gives us, those social forces that have lifted up for five years alone the burden of the crisis, the pensioners, workers and workers, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized farmers, the unemployed, the young scientists. These are the social forces that we seek to represent. These are the social forces on which we are relying. Our commitments to these social forces, to give budgetary difficulties and negative correlations in Europe, have kept them and will continue to respect them. We have already managed to protect the first home effectively, the borrowers who saw their income depleted during the crisis, and this, despite your initial and on your days - you know it - the persistent position of lenders for complete liberalisation of auctions. This was a position that you accepted at the end of your government and you signed without reservation. We have managed to extend the programme to tackle the humanitarian crisis. We have given free access to health to over two million uninsured fellow citizens. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] We have speeded up and extended the programmes to combat unemployment. We have improved the functioning of the control mechanisms, despite the fact that there is an even greater effort needed. We finally let justice breathe and started putting order in the broadcasting landscape, and let us cost this daily political cost, with the extreme attack on lies and the extreme propaganda of the systemic media against us. We dismantled the major infrastructure projects, which for five years spurred debts and new obligations for the Greek State, the major road axes, the metro of Thessaloniki, the TAP pipeline, the expansion of the rail network in the Peloponnese and northern Greece. Today, with the insurance bill, we have a basic commitment to go ahead with this necessary reform for the insurance system, without reducing even EUR 1 in basic pensions and without charging the vast majority of pensioners for a tenth consecutive time. That is what we committed in September, and that is what we achieved after a difficult and hard battle and negotiation. I would remind you that when this bill was tabled, you spoke of unilateral energy, of negotiation of the Baroufakis type, which will lead us to the extremes, precisely because we brought to Parliament a bill that does not reduce pensions. That\'s your problem! That is your concern that we will not reduce the main pensions. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] There is no one in this country, ladies and gentlemen, who do not know that our Government has not taken up duties in the blanket. To raise the burden of responsibility assigned to us by the Greek people, we had to deal with two sides of one growing from 2010 onwards. First, the state of the economy and society caused by voluntary acceptance by previous governments of aggressive and lasting austerity. Let me remind the House that those who accuse us of storms, tax and tax raids, voted on both arms of a total of EUR 63 billion from 2010 to January 2015! That was the 2010-2014 financial adjustment. In 2014 alone, the year of success and the triumph then of Mr Samaras, the measures implemented were 10 billion euros. 25%, 1/4 i.e. the Gross Domestic Product was lost by the cumulative burden of the measures and the recession. Unemployment in 2009 from 7.5% was launched close to 28%. For young people he touched 60 percent and dared some today, destroying and risking that we destroyed the economy, dismantled the country, dismantled the insurance policy and wondered. Which country did you live in all the previous years from 2010 to 2015? Which governments were you ministers to? To mountain governments, to socialist governments that gave benefits to the people? Like you\'ve already forgotten your criminal choices. But your people remember and know who he really is, who is responsible for what we live to this day. The second aspect of the problem. The fact that beyond the already grim situation there were commitments made by the Greek state signed by the then government of New Democracy - PASOK of Mr Samaras and Mr Venizelos. This has to be made clear: Our government has not only undertaken tasks in an economic and social desert, it has also undertaken tasks in a sedative and undermining field, because it has had to overturn and reverse everything that the PASOK and the New Democracy governments have signed or signed. It had to overturn first of all your commitments to primary surpluses and even stablely 4.5% of GDP. We did that. We have reduced the objectives of the programme and for the first time we have a sustainable perspective. We saved from this 20 billion for the Greek economy within the period 2015-2018, 20 billion, which obviously if we assume both of your proposals and your positions for cuts in expenditure, that is, if you stayed in the governance of the country, they would come out of the taxpayers\' pocket, pensions, salaries, redundancies and fall into the debt bucket. You agreed and considered that - I remind you at the time when you were saying that you were working and implementing 10 billion measures - which are effective and sustainable. Because as far as I remember, from this step, the former Prime Minister never stopped talking about debt sustainable, which does not need relief, only a certificate of viability was said at that time. To give us a certificate, to be happy. Especially on the question of insurance, the commitments you made, but commitments that inflamed the country, were painful. They were the commitments of the fifth evaluation - do not forget this infamous fifth evaluation, which has never been carried out - mainly by all the application of the zero deficit clause, which, as I said before, would wipe out all supplementary pensions. So we have come to the need for and the obligation to social and national, to take the chestnuts out of the fire that you have been burning and going up all these years. It is, of course, certain that the insurance system needed a deep incision, because it is an irrational, socially unfair, dashing and customer-friendly system. Only the IKA reminds you that at the moment it has nine hundred different insurance packages, and at the same time it is a system that does not respond to the country\'s current economic situation. After the recession of the last six years, it is impossible to survive without a deep reform. A reform that you have never made but horizontal cuts. On the contrary, your logic was contagious. Eleven horizontal cuts. Neither one, nor two, nor three, nor the result, obviously, was the massive poverty of pensioners and an unsustainable insurance system. Our political choice lies right on the reverse. The plan that we are voting on today aims to create a system that, on the one hand, will be sustainable and will guarantee pensions for all Greeks and Greeks, for all citizens, and on the other hand, will have a basic principle of social justice, given the difficult economic conditions. We are therefore moving on to reinstate the insurance system on tracks of sustainability, without reducing the main pensions for the tenth time and without affecting the vast majority of the subsidiary. For in the vast majority of pensioners, the fearful people who have seen twelve cuts with the ""say, say"" and the propaganda\'s headlines, there has been the impression that another one is coming. But for 92.5%, for two million and a hundred thousand pensioners, one euro is not cut off from their pensions, and this is the great conquest of the negotiating effort we have made. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] Do you remember what you were telling us in the election September? Whatever the government is going to be forced, you said, whoever the Minister of Labour is, to cut the horizontal pensions to 30%. Today disprove once again. In fact, in how many controversy you burn, it is a question of course. Because the evidence is vague and proves that the bill provides for better replacement rates for all pensions for those with an average income in their working life of up to EUR 1,000. You\'re saying it\'s very little. But do you know that this corresponds to 87% of the employees and about 90% of the self-employed and unfortunately 99% of the farmers? We are therefore bringing about a really necessary reform, trying to divide the burden on those who can bring it up and not on themselves, on the pensioners and on the weak, by creating a single insurance body, the uniform rules for calculating contributions and pensions, the introduction of a national pension to which the payroll will be added. Because I saw you paraphrase what I said in my speech to the parliamentary group. I compared what would happen to the farmer, who, in ten years\' time from now, would be entitled to the pension of EUR 0 basic and only the reward and would receive a pension of about EUR 250. I said that the amount of the national pension would be added so that it would have a pension of more than EUR 600. I compared EUR 250 to EUR 620 and said: \'Yes, it can be a decent choice of EUR 620 instead of EUR 250\'. So this is a huge attempt here to create conditions of social justice within a difficult, in fact, budgetary policy, which we are forced to do, due to the fact that you have reduced GDP by 1/4, and therefore expenditure as a percentage of GDP for pensions has risen to 17% and when you have 17% of pension expenditure, then you do not have the opportunity to support the social state, the hospitals, health and education. Of course the solution is to produce wealth and regain GDP, which you have lost for the country in the past five years. At the same time as this reform, we harmonise the rules on contributions and benefits between new and old insured persons and the individual funds and restore chronic distortions and long-term injustices between insured persons. There has been a lot of talk about freelance professionals, where in fact there is an increase in income. There is an increase, however, for 10% of the free professions. For 90% that were insured before 1993 and have a net taxable income of up to 13 000 per year, the situation is as follows. Their monthly insurance contributions of up to EUR 150 per month are reduced for both old and new insured persons. The most characteristic example of this case is that with the new system, a free businessman insured from 1-7-2017 who is on the lowest income scale will pay EUR 87 a month instead of EUR 210 a month that would necessarily pay today. Let me give you another example, which concerns the engineering industry, my profession. A new engineer after 1993, for ten years of insurance, with an income of EUR 7,000 today, paid EUR 576 a month. The new system will deliver 232 euros a month. To reach the EUR 576, it must have more than 17 000 net taxable income. Because in all the professions there is the great majority that says a few, because it works in precariousness and in the blocks, and of course there are - I am not saying, they have been pressed - who can bear weight. Otherwise, the pensioners and the weak would pick it up once again. That\'s our difference. I would also like to refer to special attention to young people who are in the first steps of professional careers. The bill provides for a transitional period for deductions to insurance contributions for the critical period of the first five years of their professional life. Finally, for engineers, doctors and lawyers, this will now apply. By 2021, for income from EUR 7 000 to EUR 13 000, that is to say, 90% of the self-employed, there will be a 50% discount on contributions and therefore a relief in relation to the current contributions, while an income of EUR 30,000 will be provided for a 32% discount. So their indebtedness over today will exist, but it will be small, it will be minimal. Let us not forget, of course, - I mentioned before - the great majority of my colleagues in the new engineers, lawyers, who are often working in these ""ladys"" offices. Their employers were, of course, the first to protest on the tie. That\'s good. People went to protest once. It\'s not bad. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] But be careful. Workers, black-block scientists will only pay 6% of the contribution and 20% of the employers. So let this specula stop in relation to the contributions. The government and the Ministry of Labour have done everything in our power to ensure, I repeat, the majority of scientists and free trades. But of course, when you want the equation to come out and you want to favour the majority, you will unfair the minority. But it is not an ignorant majority in this place, Mr Mitsotakis. He understands who we are working on and who we are trying to favour and facilitate. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] The same rules apply to the tax bill. In addition, there was close cooperation between the Ministries of Finance and Labour, so that the interventions in insurance and taxation could be combined and the final result of taxation and insurance contributions would be favourable to low and medium-income incomes. The tax bill comes to meet the criteria of progressivity and fairer burden-sharing. With our intervention, 98% of taxpayers will have a minimum burden, or even a relief from what has been the case to date. Nine out of ten free professionals will now pay a lower tax. The same applies to 71% of taxpayers with gross income from wages and business activity. It is worth mentioning that there is an attempt to restore to the place and a timeless injustice, and even at a time when we have a huge demographic problem. Because it\'s become a presumption of having over two children at the place. With our proposal, 61% of the third and polytexts will pay a lower tax than he paid to this day. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to tire you with numbers. But I felt the need for this terrible distortion and propaganda of days to speak with numbers today, just before a critical vote and when the Greek people are watching us. But I will not go through my speech on these, because I think it is time for us to finally talk about the next day. To talk about what will happen after the completion of the evaluation. For the possibilities and prospects that this country has. You know, that\'s the main issue from now on. Our political opponents will understand that they are wrong, I hope they understand it soon. They are consumed in dangers and catastrophes. We have no reason to follow them. Let us move forward, we have other priorities and let me talk about them, because during the last few months the Greek Government has been working on two fronts. One is the negotiation, for which I have been placed on several occasions, both myself and the ministers. The other thing, however, where we have worked and continue to work, is a plan designed with specific lines of action. A project that has already been implemented and will certainly accelerate its next evaluation. The priority of this project is for Greece to pass through the period of extreme recession in a period of recovery and development. Watch out, though, and here may be another difference we have. Not of any development, because there is that development based on the collapse of work and the social state - and that is the neoliberal plan that you are adopting, Mr Mitsotakis - and there is, of course, development with a social dimension, with support for competitiveness through innovation and quality, with the protection of the work and the conquests of workers. With an increase in wages and Community benefits, the first chance that this will be possible. With the support of the purchasing power of the social majority. This is our plan and this is our political horizon. You wondered how did we manage to catch the surplus of 1% above the target? It was the first time, after five years, that they did not decrease to the place by name, wages and pensions. This shows that the way out of the crisis is to stimulate active demand and not to cut costs, namely wages and pensions, which is your alternative, Mr Mitsotakis. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] We will not, however, fall into the same mistake, however, to adopt the perception of the success story, constantly talking about the well-being of the numbers. Because if the welfare of numbers is not in line with the well-being of people, then we have a hole in the water. The development which, based on the Commission\'s forecasts, comes in a few months\' time - second half of 2016 - will have a social value. I\'m explaining. Greece is a country that is able to produce new wealth. In order to do this, it must have a strategy which will form an environment which is favourable to both attracting investment and protecting work. The existing development tools must be fully exploited and exploited. We worked on a method when you said we were destroying the economy and we were able for the first time, the country being the first to the absorbance of the NRP, 98% of the available resources last year. In the same direction we will continue this year, with an emphasis on innovation and guided by the knowledge and appetite of thousands of young people who attempt to be inclined to work, their appetite for creation. At the same time, we have close cooperation with the European institutions to make use of the Juncker package and to specialise in the actions of the European Investment Bank. Also for the first time after a decade, the European Development and Reconstruction Bank, EBRD, will return to Greece in order to contribute to the recovery effort. A few days ago the draft of the new development law, which has already been put into consultation, was announced, a law that shapes the framework for an investment activity on solid foundations. It is favourable for the great investment that the Greek economy and our main concern for attracting them at the moment, it is to read, listen to the pursuits of businesses and investors. The conclusion is that what constitutes the basis for a firm investment project is something beyond the Greek lined-up, that is, the reduction in both labour costs and the tax rates of large companies. What is of top importance and is a matter, is the stable tax environment and that is what companies are asking for. That is why with the new development we are proposing to introduce a fixed tax rate for twelve years to those who make investments of more than 20 million. I think that such moves may send a message to those who see Greece as an important investment opportunity, not to speculate but to create infrastructure, which the country so needs and of course to reduce unemployment. This is some indicative of the preparation and dialogue, which must also be launched in Parliament for the new era and the next period. I think they will offer good service to the place, those who are really interested in making suggestions, thoughts and improvements in the course of things the next day. I would like to say at this point that we must insist on the way in which wealth and jobs are produced, rather than retracting bankrupt positions, such as the one to which the International Monetary Fund has repeatedly referred, but also here in Greece and the New Democracy and BSE. Because if the solution is redundancies, that is to say, a hundred and eighty thousand civil servants are fired and the state should be charged with several billion for compensation, and if this is a strategy to attract investment, then something is wrong. What\'s wrong with it, and it\'s not right, it\'s obsessed. I am not referring, of course, to the need to rationalise the functioning of the state, its structures, its employees. I am referring to a neoliberal obsession for redundancies, which has never been beneficial to any development effort. On the contrary. The redundancies are making the unemployment burden even greater. So let us put aside the obsessions and see the real challenges and suggestions that we have at the table for the next day. Because the streamlining of the state that will contribute to the development of the Greek economy is not achieved either by adjectives or by failed neoliberal recipes and redundancies. We have received a state that is certainly not our creation. It was a creation of your governments, Mr. Mitsotakis. Of course he needs a reform plan. He wants to erupt the abscesses of corruption, he wants hard treatment for those who operate as the Trojan Horses of interests within the state structure, he wants to use the new technologies, simplify the procedures. In other words, it wants a redefinition of the principles of functionality and respect for the citizen. To go ahead, however, this plan is a basic condition. Who will prepare it and who will implement it. What leadership is it that can take on this case. Here I think there\'s another difference beyond our ideological ideology. In order to be able to proceed with such a project and implement it, we need an honest relationship with the citizens, a relationship of confidence. This relationship of confidence cannot have the old political system, which has unearthed both the corruption and the complexity of the state and the inefficiency of contact with the citizen. You can blame us for a lot, even for not having the experience. But you can\'t blame us for one thing. That we are the ones who created all of this, that we are the ones that incubated the relationship between corruption and interlocutory. You cannot blame us for the inequality of our intentions, to bring about a substantial change in this place. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] So our aim is now that we go through the hardest cavo, look at tomorrow. And, as the poet says: \'the future will not come from itself like this, neto stead\'. We need to work, plan, vision tomorrow of memorial Greece. The next day it wants stability, security and social justice, but it also wants determination for large sectors in the economy, in the state. And let me say that this is neither a neutral nor a moderate political approach. It\'s a radical, Dimitris, and a left approach. Because in today\'s difficult conditions, left and radical, it is not to fantasize an ideal society, which you know is no matter how much you fight it, it is not easy to come, but to bleed to create, even slowly but firmly, the conditions in which changes in the protection of the rights of the many can thrive. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] Politicians who will open streets for the forces of work. But there can be no way for the forces of work if there is no work at the place. This is why a left-wing, progressive policy nowadays is the one struggling to create jobs and to share the burdens and the benefits of expected growth fairly. I want to close, ladies and gentlemen, with a reference to what is happening these days, these days: most economic analysts say that the Greek economy can be like the spring that has been compressed six years and now it is ready to eject. But we all know that\'s not a simple thing. It is a function of restoring the climate of confidence of investors, markets and citizens themselves to the Greek economy. This restoration inevitably goes through courageous decisions and with regard to the debt issue. So I would like to say, today with caution and without great words and drumming, because a very complex and difficult negotiation is under way, just to say that tomorrow is a very important day. After six years of European institutions constantly convening to discuss the Greek crisis and discuss only austerity measures, tomorrow Eurogroup will meet on a daily agenda and the relief of the Greek debt. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] What has been a promise for so many years, tomorrow, is officially on the agenda. Honestly, I do not know - I say this sincerely, Mr Mitsotakis - what the Anti-Population proposals and yours are on this crucial issue. I\'m open, if you like, to meet, to talk. Perhaps it would be worthwhile, instead of keeping such a contradictory and miserable attitude, to tell us your suggestion of this crucial subject. What I know, however, is that it is a good thing for the country that this debate begins and the government line is not what the previous government had, Mr Samaras, with Mr Venizelos, namely that the debt is sustainable and all we need is a certificate of viability. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] I do not want to talk at this point about a number of important statements by European officials who have shaped an unprecedented climate of support for Greek positions in recent years. What I said proves this, that this is the first time since the crisis started, since 2010, when Greece seems to have so strong alliances in Europe and that the Greek positions have so strong supporters. However, I would just like to refer to a statement, because I believe that it is of special interest, because it is not a declaration by a Portuguese, French, it is a statement by a German and not by the opposition, by a high official, by the Vice-Chancellor of the German Government, by Mr Gabriel, who said yesterday in \'REUTERS\' that he must finally break - and now is the time - this vicious circle. He said that Greece needs debt relief and that since we know that it is going to happen at some point, it makes no sense to avoid it. He also stated that it is a great mistake to ask Greece to meet its needs with new austerity measures, especially now that it has achieved better economic growth than one could expect. I hope and hope that this constructive position and attitude will be taken tomorrow at the Eurogroup and Germany\'s Finance Minister, Mr Symble. In any case, however, we have an important opportunity before us both for the country to break this vicious circle, finally to enter the virtuous circle and for Europe to demonstrate the courage and courage needed to close a deep wound and finally to begin the final exit from the crisis not only for Greece but for the whole of Europe. [[Applause from the wings of SYRIZA and ANEL]] He needs boldness and braveness like the one he shows today and the majority of our National Representation will show. We started a course to get the country out of the deadlock in which prior governments convicted it. We raised our head, we loudly called the right of our people. Now that it is time to see that this trouble, this struggle has not gone lost, it is time to continue with more confidence. We are at the most critical point. We stand up, protect the weakest, pass the difficult cavo, come out in calm waters and we all start the great struggle together, rebuild on solid foundations of social justice and advancement tomorrow of our country, tomorrow of the Greek people. I am sure, ladies and gentlemen, that we will succeed. Better days come and they deserve our place and our people!', 'Thank you very much, Mr President. Prime Minister, we heard you all the time presenting a situation almost idyllic about what\'s happening in the country. And I am sure that the Greeks and Greeks who listened to you, who live in anguish, fear and insecurity, are wondering all this time if they are out of place and time. I would therefore like to say that precisely because we understand what is happening around us in this country, so we have asked for this debate to be held today in this House. And I have to tell you that you are either beautiful or you are trying to look them up to us and through the Greek Parliament to the Greek people. But both are extremely dangerous this time. I\'ll come in detail on all the issues you\'ve raised. But before I get to the essence of our debate, I would like to focus on two issues which I consider to be important. You said that our life would never be the same again after the coroner. It is certain that pandemic changes the way we see things, changes our everyday lives, changes, if you like, the public life itself. However, ladies and gentlemen, nothing at all justifies the promotion of rape as a daily regularity, and indeed by television broadcast. I cannot help talking about what has happened in the last few days. And I want to say that as a politician and as a woman, not only am I against these logics, but I will confront them with all my powers. And I think that this must do and condemn all the political forces in this House. [[Applause from the Wing of Change Movement]] I come to the second important problem posed by the coronary pandemic. Democracy is weakened every day, because daily accountability, consultation, proper legislation, social control, and the functioning of the press are weakened. There are governments that increasingly see all this as an unnecessary luxury supposedly in the face of what they face. And, unfortunately, we are also observing these symptoms in the functioning of your own government, and I can only point it out today from this Step. We showed, the Change Movement, our responsible attitude since the first moment the coronary appeared in Greece. And it is certain that this crisis leads us to prioritise the protection of human life. However, for us along with this important battle, it is extremely important to try not to allow the graceful blow to those who are still paying the broken ones of the previous crisis. Alas, Prime Minister, if on the back of the Greeks who, as I told you before, are afraid and worried, come to add achievements of an old right, the right that has a hidden agenda in national matters, the right which is difficult to look for faults elsewhere, even if they are young or underage students, of the right who believes in the doctrine ""law and order"", but not for everyone, has two weights - personally I disagree with the ""law and order"", but also with the ""two meters and two weights"" - of the right of establishment of the state with blue curriculum vitae, of the right that distorts reality, as it suits, even when monuments of global cultural heritage are burned, of the right that sees in the public goods of education and health, of the right right that distorts the reality, as it suits them, even when monuments of the world heritage, of the right that is seen in the public goods of education and health, where it serves as a better than other people\'s, or is able to do so much more than one of other people\'storicing. Finally, the right which has not said a single word about increasing the funding of the National Health System and public hospitals. There is not a single word in this whole plan of\'shoes\', which you are obviously adopting. If nothing else, Mr Mitsotakis, I would like to tell you that this mask of the Social Democrats you have been trying to wear lately does not protect you from the chronic diseases of your party and your resignation. These policies follow you. It is therefore a duty of the Vice-President and of the democratic party to ask you today, Prime Minister, for the facts of your government in the last six months, because, despite what you said to us, the truth is one: even today you are looking for a plan for this second phase of the pandemic, because you did not take advantage of the time when the pandemic was in recession, because, unfortunately, the sunset of Santorini was followed by incoming cases, which, for several days, were circulating freely until the test, its outcome, and to know whether or not this man should be restricted. Of course all of these followed local lockdown. You once told us that the country could not withstand a new general lockdown nor a local one. Now, of course, we see another reality forming your responsibility. In fact, you restricted the controls instead of increasing them, because you ran out of labs and molecular analysts. The cases have been multiplied, Prime Minister, as have the patients in the intensive sector, as are the victims we are mourning and now threating the whole population, even young people. The average of the new cases is thirty-nine and the expert forecasts are unfavourable. So the return to the problem is a fact. And I ask: How did we get this far, Mr Mitsotakis, risk losing what we all won together in the first phase of the pandemic? I\'ll tell you right away. I\'ll answer you. You first gave the message of relaxation. You almost whistled the end while it was obvious that we were not done with the pandemic. Your own government officials and you yourself participated in a series of events without wearing a mask and without keeping any protection measures, no distances, no nothing. Everything was clear. And as soon as the cases began to grow, the young started to blame. These are incomprehensible things. You told us, Prime Minister, in June, that there were zero cases. You have opened up tourism - and above all the land borders - without conditions, without any control at first. ""Come"" you said ""in Greece, bring your friends. We have opened up."" Those are your words. And now you insist that cases are not imported, that the citizens are to blame. Since there were no cases, Mr Mitsotakis, how did the citizens get involved, since there were no cases in Greece? When were you lying to us? When you were telling us we didn\'t have cases? When you were telling us they weren\'t imported and it wasn\'t the tourist\'s fault? Or were you lying to us in both cases, why is the truth that we also had imported cases? The list of errors does not stop what I mentioned. I must remind you that all summer, citizens were literally stacked in public transport. Now you have begun to discuss several routes, etc., even for driver recruitment and the purchase of buses. You increased the fullness rate to 85% and to the planes to 100%, when the incidents increased. While you knew that Immigrant hospitals were health bombs, you did nothing to protect their health, and even more you did nothing to limit the spread, because these people are all around, they go to hospitals, leave hospitals, get the results, do not find them by doctors. Ask them to tell you what\'s going on. They\'re all over the place. And of course, what is going on in the nursing homes is nightmareous and unacceptable. We have pointed this out from the outset. You knew that there would be a problem and you did not take steps to protect the health and life of these people. The key, Prime Minister, in this case - we have said it many times and I will not be tired of repeating it, from April - are the tests and the mobile steps for early tracking. Not only did you organize them in time, but you also let the greed shine. You told us that public hospitals are cooperating with the private sector. Explain to us exactly how, because so far you refuse to put a plaque on the price of the test and cover it up by the EOGY, and now you\'re running. The National Center for Haemodiasia stated that it cannot withstand any other tests due, obviously, to lack of funding, staff and reagents. In hospitals there is a very serious delay in issuing the test results, even in people, in patients who are waiting for surgery. So tell us exactly how this cooperation took place with the private sector. Do you deny what\'s written for the 1st District PSUR? Did it or did it not order hospitals in Attica with a specific private group for the tests and, in fact, for the benefit of the group in relation to the costs of the CSR? Was there a known middle name? So I ask where we\'re going. Listen, Prime Minister, this. You have to commit to us today that all public hospitals - and university hospitals - will be able to test the citizens, because they can\'t now. Big public hospitals are not able to do it. You rule, you have a responsibility to solve the problems. For us, the responsible Opposition, the road is one, to have tough criticism just to make it possible, to correct and ultimately, to put forward creative alternatives. We do not sit with our hands crossed to wait for anger and pain to grow and to come all this to fruit. Get away from us all those logics. Now I come to the National Health System and continue with the substance, that, in fact, Mr Mitsotakis, it needs support, but in practice. Finally, no more words. You applauded the health workers from the balconies to the heart of the crisis. You joined the heavy and unhealthy? Oh, no. Refugee it. So many times we tabled a proposal for a law and you respond constantly with a \'no\'. In practice we must recognise their offer. I come to the regular staff because you talked about recruitment. For your day, the regular staff in the National Health System has been reduced by a thousand hundred and forty-seven doctors and health workers, and the subsidiary, Prime Minister, has been reduced by thirty-six, and we are looking to find out where they are and what the thousands of temporary recruitment are doing, which in total are going to go beyond eight thousand - on the pretext of dealing with COVID -19. Where are these people? What are they doing? Only four hundred and ten of them are doctors. The fact is that the system is currently in need of immediate recruitment of permanent staff and, of course, rapid seminars for the staff to be recruited. Because you know what\'s gonna happen to us? We\'ve got donations, and they\'re delaying getting to the system, but they\'ll get there. So we\'ll have beds, we\'ll have respirators and all the machinery we need and if we\'ve managed to hire this permanent staff, it\'ll be a staff who hasn\'t been able to train for this function in intensive care units, and we\'ll stay looking at it and we\'ll also ask him for responsibilities from the top. So tell us what you have planned for the early training of this staff. What is the timetable for permanent staff coming? Where have all these thousands of recruits been allocated? What are these people doing? I repeat: at last make use of the primary health care network. We\'ve been calling it from March, I think. You had announced sometime in May, adopting the proposal of the Change Movement, that you will make mobile workshops in primary health care. We\'re still waiting for this. In view of the winter, and because we know that flu will come too, it is essential that you move on very quickly in creating these scales. You have the network. Coordinate it, organize it. Don\'t make only recruitments everywhere. I shall, of course, repeat the question of tests. Testing, testing and testing, with the priority of health, welfare structures, homes, public services which come into contact with the public and of course the structures of migrants. The private sector must also assume its responsibilities, obviously with less profit. Let them understand that within this crisis, it is not possible for their profits to be the same, to be favoured only by those who are going on in this place. Can\'t you give it to them to understand that? Can\'t you get them into a central design? Give them a responsibility even to take on the workers of companies returning to work after the holiday. All this is paid, and it\'s a lot of money, Prime Minister. It goes without saying that, once the vaccine is delivered, there should be the possibility of direct and free access to all citizens, of course in the vulnerable categories of the population. The question, however, is who will want to and will agree to make this vaccine. I would therefore point out very early, Prime Minister, that an information campaign is needed in favour of the vaccine. Also, there is a need for an information campaign in favour of the mask. It is incomprehensible what we have been living in Greece for the last few days. This logic of conspiracy theory must finally be hit once and for all at the place. It is a logic that began at other difficult times at the beginning of the economic crisis. I would remind you that this logic of \'anti-anti-immemorandum\', that is, there is another policy, another mixture, does not do well by the german germans, who then added, the traitors, all of them - your party established it, Mr Mitsotakis. And, of course, other populist forces have then come and scanned them all. Now, then, this ""instead"" you\'ve made it and built it, you find it toward you, but the bad thing is that the country itself finds it, you and your government do not only find it. And only together can we put an end to this logic, which is dangerous to the health and life of the citizens. Finally, it needs serious preparation for travel from now on to a country. We\'ve been saying it all along, and I understand it\'s not just your responsibility. You cannot alone impose on the European Union or on the international community what will happen, but you too have a voice and that voice must be possible. It cannot continue this, each country every month or every 15 days to change the data on how to travel because it will be disastrous the effects on the economy from now on. They\'ll stop the trips, they\'ll be severely reduced. So set a framework for travelers to know from the start what they should do. Must they have a negative test? Never? How many days ago? Do they have to fill in this form you\'ve made? Fill in the form. It must be uniform rules and well-known and stable, unless there are dramatic developments in the Coronovir case, we all understand that. Ladies and gentlemen, the situation created by the opening up of schools - I come to this very big issue - shows once again that the government is unprepared. Far from us the logic of not opening the schools. We don\'t want closed schools. We need safe schools. Come here to see and discuss what you have done and what could be done, because you lost all the months you could have discussed with the educational community and informed parents and students and have taken your measures so that we do not have more than fifteen children in each department. We could not agree on this and you would come and tell me, Prime Minister, \'Yes, I hear it about the few parts, it would be good, but we cannot do it\'. Why can\'t you do it? Why couldn\'t more rooms be found? Why couldn\'t the teachers be activated either by volunteering or by recruitment? Why could distance learning not take advantage of real, not of the studio class? You could have done teacher training all this time. Why couldn\'t you even have organized shifts? You could have reduced even the matter. I can talk to you a thousand things right now. So why was it so difficult and impossible in the end to do what most European countries do and you must finally impose the crowding on children in the classroom? We are therefore interested in the safety of both children and teachers and workers in schools and the families of all of them. This is very crucial, but it seems that the government is only required to have a mask and a cucumber. That\'s what God helps, I add then. Does the criticism I make often bother you that you are following the logic of\'seeing and doing\', but what have you done differently in opening schools? Tell us something specific. I want to read you a letter that came to me a day or two ago on my personal e-mail. He writes the husband of an educator: ""I would like to share with you a fact that has particularly troubled me. My wife is a teacher and on Thursday night she received an informational e-mail according to which, after contacting the Education Department, ETAY gave instructions to all school teachers - and my wife - they should be quarantineed for 14 days. The reason was a teacher who took part in the meeting of her school teacher club two to three days ago and found positive"". This teacher, of course, these two - three days, was circulating in the county everywhere without knowing the result. So he writes to me: ""I cannot describe the inconvenience caused to these people and our families. The following day, after the intervention of the Ministry of Education and consultation with EGEY, a new briefing was sent, according to which not all the teachers who participated in the meeting will finally enter quarantine, but only those who sat next to the teacher found positive."" He says man: ""I am obviously not in a position to judge the substance of the case, but it is visible by the naked eye or the total absence of a framework of basic directives by the relevant bodies."" He writes this, I\'m not saying it. \'I do not hide you\' - he writes to me - \'that we felt extremely alone. We didn\'t know what to do. Insecurity is the worst counselor in such cases. You realize that the educational community is retarded."" After this incident EGE\'s instructions were issued, which I invite you to study, because of what I have looked at at the conclusion is that the mess was merely institutionalized. I\'ll see you, if you want, in dentistry. In fact, it is not the area of education that is either sterile opposition, it is not even for sloppyness and experimentation, and we should all have it very well in our minds. Of course, problems are not dealt with by authoritarianism. The tsubukas to children, and even to adolescents, can bring exactly the opposite results to what we expect you to have in mind. I come now, ladies and gentlemen, on the third topic of the debate, namely the impact on the economy and society, on businesses and on workers. I appeal again to the Prime Minister, who not only has the central responsibility of all final decisions, but also, instead of a final state, has set up a very centralised mechanism in the Maximus Mansion. Mr. Mitsotakis, you also told us that our economy is being led to a two-digit recession, 15.2% in the second quarter. This means that to a large extent - obviously not just because of it, we do not close them and we do not level them all - your measures proved to be inadequate and delayed. You should know that there are sizes of the economy coming back even twenty-two years. Small and medium-sized enterprises are threatened with padlocks. GFCF speaks of the death of the trader, the professional and the craftsman, I add. We have price reductions that are on average at 45% and liquidity has never reached those who really needed it. You let the banks run the test, and they actually gave the loans to their good customers. Now you are announcing a new bankruptcy code that actually turns the owners into tenants of their first home. Once again just serve the funds. Owners are tenants. The first residence is not protected. We insist on our proposal for a sustainable and effective framework to protect the first residence. I\'m coming to tourism. Unfortunately, it is obvious that the year is gone. That\'s not the result we expected. We went worse than predictions. Revenue from foreign tourists will be reduced below 20% of the previous year. You did not, Prime Minister, reduce VAT on focusing and accommodation to make the Greek product attractive and competitive, and of course you did not give strong incentives, in time, to open up more businesses. The vast majority of the hoteliers kept the units closed. Of course, this has led to unemployment taking a threatening dimension. Your Minister is once again celebrating this society again with the voucher, because unemployment is allegedly increasing only 1.3%. Who\'s he laughing at? ELSTAT\'s figures clearly show that jobs in the economy in May were a hundred ninety-three thousand three hundred twelve less than in May 2019. The worst of all is that about two hundred thousand people have been so disappointed that they are not looking for a job, they do not claim to join production. Of course, on the other hand, apart from unemployment, the other thing is that workers are condemned to poverty. Over a million people have at this time the poverty allowance of EUR 534 and, of course, the dogma \'half the job, half the wage\' is being forced. Instead of subsidising 40% of the wage, as we have proposed, you obligate businesses and workers to work only with part-time employment, with the unsuccessful work programme, while at the same time undermining sectoral collective agreements and refusing to support them. What are you actually doing with this tactic? You close your eyes to the poor and unconscious employers and that creates unfair competition on the market, because not all employers are in the same fate. Hundreds of thousands of hotel workers are threatened to lose even the unemployment benefit. I too am wondering - if you can give us the information - how many people have been subsidised by the OAS last year and how many are now being subsidised through this exceptional allowance. Recently your Minister submitted to the House provisions for new adverse measures. Any worker, he says, has to quarantine, even if he does not have the same responsibility, must then work overtime without pay. It is not only unacceptable and provocative but also obviously unconstitutional. It is planned to grant a reduced Christmas gift for workers who have been forced to suspend work. You need to see this. Legislate a computer of 534 euros. But the state, Prime Minister, has to cover this difference. Workers should normally get the gift corresponding to their nominal salary. And as a cherry on the cake, the statements about the pension are coming. I\'m going to go back to dentistry because I see I don\'t have any time for this right now. I also said at the outset that I am very concerned about the fact that you are trying to make things look good. In fact, you come and make poor comparisons with economies of other countries that have a completely different structure from ours. And that\'s not just wrong. I heard you repeating numbers and making comparisons. But all this is disorientated from correct solutions to the problems of the Greek economy which has specific features. So we should plan solutions right on the problems of the Greek economy. If we don\'t see them, because we want to look at them, we\'re just never gonna solve them. You\'ll never solve them. You did not hear us when we proposed the interim programme to keep the economy alive and society upright. You left to merciful business and workers. We told you. It\'s hard after you come to build on ruins. Now you\'re talking about reserves. You\'ve lost your battles, though. That\'s why you\'re looking for the reserves. And I repeat once again, Mr Mitsotakis. Now take effective measures before it\'s too late. We will also be waiting to hear from you in the report. It\'s no longer a report. It is the forum of the Thessaloniki Exhibition. Unfortunately, everything changes. But we will also be there with our own proposals and with answers to what we are going to hear. For businesses, what is needed is a new liquidity grant programme based on the company\'s viability this time, Prime Minister, not on being a good customer to the banks. It needs to strengthen the programme of repayable advance. With all his problems it was the only measure that came and gave a breath to the businesses. Nothing else worked out from what you\'ve announced to date. We say, therefore, that this measure must be strengthened by EUR 2 billion, in addition to the EUR 1.8 billion that you have announced and, above all, on the basis of the business turnover, so that this liquidity is fair. Revenue subsidy of 40% for the firms affected, student accommodation until the end of 2020 without any further burden on the owners. But, Mr Mitsotakis, we are talking about the full subsidy of 40% of the total rent. You come and talk about a 40% reduction, if it does, each owner, that is, much less aid to the tenant than he needs and to the one we are proposing. Removal of the trade fee for small and medium-sized enterprises and farmers and an irresponsible bank account for professionals. If you don\'t now, when will it finally be? Prolongation until the end of the year of the measures to defer payments to the companies affected by the crisis, but at the same time to join sustainable arrangements so that they can sometime repay. Because what will happen, Mr. Mitsotakis? At some point the obligation to pay will be opened, but the economic situation will not have improved by magic from one moment to the next, since you too are not taking the appropriate measures. So how will they pay when you tell them \'Come now\' if you have not foreseen sustainable arrangements so that they can cope with it? Of course, it is very important, since we are talking about regulation, that those who have joined the regulation of a hundred and twenty doses, and within the problem of the coronary, have not been able to be okay and fulfil their obligations, do not come out of this arrangement. It is extremely important, Mr Mitsotakis. You have to. It will be disastrous for all these people if they lose this opportunity, which will not be given again. And so that the next year will not be lost in tourism, I repeat our proposal for competitiveness, for VAT to be reduced to 6% for focusing and staying and, of course, for VAT to be reduced to the islands, all the islands that existed without exceptions, for the Aegean islands. I come to our proposals for workers. We repeat this once again, instead of the failed \'Cosmos - WORK\' for companies that suffer the consequences of the crisis. Coverage of 40% of employees\' wages, maintaining jobs and existing contracts. Cover all workers who lose their jobs and those who are already unemployed with an increased unemployment benefit for as long as the crisis lasts and a decent allowance guaranteed by you for the autumn and winter months to all workers seasonally in tourism and catering, without terms and conditions. It\'s extremely important. You take them a month - month with extensions, with crumbs, and in many cases they are both families, and the man and woman worked in tourism. How will they make out in winter, how will their homes and children live? Obligations run. Can they plan for one month extensions and poverty benefits? If the state doesn\'t show his face to these people, who\'s gonna show it to? I said this before, with a job suspension, with the contribution of the State and finally a declaration of compulsory sectoral agreements, first of all that of foodism. And I would like to say a few words about the farmers who have been completely abandoned in their luck. It is necessary to support livestock enterprises, with payment of aid, as soon as possible, all amounts due by the ELGA and all outstanding subsidies to farmers and farmers. Settle the debts to banks and EEKA for the sectors affected. And finally cover the damage caused by natural disasters in recent years. It is a very big problem facing the olive growers. All these months, we don\'t get any answers. I will repeat once again the need for reform of the ELGA regulation. We are all talking about climate change, but the ELGA in its regulation does not include compensation for the effects on farmers of phenomena already associated with climate change in our country. Finally, it has to be done. Payment to farmers of the amounts due from the Rural Development Programme. And finally, at some point let us know what you have agreed on the new CAP, which will significantly affect the future of the country\'s rural world. Mr Mitsotakis, do not re-invoke these difficult hours, firstly, financial narrowness, because, where you want to give, you find the money, you can secure it. Secondly, because we have no financial constraints this year. You yourself said that the lending of the country, due to the contribution of the European Central Bank, is very favourable. So we need to use it now, not just to see the charts. The ECB has led us there, not your own policy, to say things by their name. Thirdly, use the reserve at last, especially the part that does not need to be approved by the ESM and is based on the sweat of Greek citizens and overtaxation. If not now, I repeat that economic and social deadlocks are evident, when will you do that? You said in Thessaloniki recently that your Government is marked by credibility, consistency and effectiveness. I could reverse them, talk about inconsistencies, inconsistencies, inefficiency and add also a profound conservative approach and perception to which solutions you ultimately give. The truth is, Mr Mitsotakis, as much as you do not like, that you go with the logic of\'seeing and doing\', both in the pandemic and in the economy and, unfortunately, in national matters. I told you the other day, in our debate again in the House, that you do not lead, that you do not advance, that you are following foreign policy. You did not seek to form a national line with inner corrosion. Refugee the Council of Political Heads. In fact, the various loots are trying to reap public debates of this kind. I would like to believe, Prime Minister, that you do not adopt everything they say on your behalf. It would be useful to hear your opinion. I would also like to point out that you leave space for both nationalism and patriocardialism in the way you handle things and of course have exclusive responsibility. You were saying, Prime Minister, no challenge is going to go unanswered. The \'ORUC REIS\', however, still walks like nothing is going on at all. We\'ve learned from your former consultant that he doesn\'t just walk, but he also did research. And when he said that, you didn\'t deny him, you fired him, probably because he said it, because you haven\'t disrespected him until today. I asked you last time and I didn\'t get an answer. I\'m going back to the question. At the same time, threats and blackmails are escalating. And because it is always heard that Greece is in dialogue with Turkey - we hear one, we hear two, we hear three - we must, Prime Minister, finally clarify things and tell us what is happening in NATO. NATO secretary told us that you are talking and now one is talking about dialogue and the other is talking about technical discussions. Will you finally tell us, Mr. Mitsotakis, exactly what\'s going on? Now, you say that when the Turks leave the Turkish ships, the dialogue will begin in general. So you need to make two things clear: one is that dialogue with Turkey is not with the gun at the table and the second is what dialogue we are having when we are able to start it, only for one thing, for the continental shelf and for the AEZ and nothing else. This must not only be said internally, but it must also be clearly said to those who have taken a mediation role, which must be an honest and clear role, with a well-known context in the first place. That\'s what we want to tell you for so long, we don\'t want to embarrass you, we don\'t want to tie your hands. To help the place, we want to strengthen Greece\'s voice. Greece\'s voice is strengthened if the Prime Minister of Greece clears all this up to all its interlocutors and to all international organisations by saying that this is not a line I am saying, just Mitsotakis and my government, but it is a national line that supports a overwhelming front inside the country. So that\'s what we want to achieve. [[Applause from the Wing of Change Movement]] We are, of course, still waiting for the sanctions that the Union is going to announce at some point. And it is impressive that while the European Union, leading in France, sees nothing else from the Union! - the dangerous safety gap, but also the strong possibility - says - of conflict in the Eastern Mediterranean has done nothing to date to fill this gap. And obviously, they have not been demanded on the Greek side in an urgent and clear way. I am saying a proposal in addition to what has been discussed. Consider it, Prime Minister. On the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon in Article 42(1), the European Union can and must set up a military mission and could do so in order to prevent conflicts in the Eastern Mediterranean. I would remind you that the European Union is always present. It gives the\'residence\' dynamically, but does not give it where there is a serious risk, as it sees, for peace and stability in the region in the Eastern Mediterranean. So why doesn\'t he do it? I have heard your Foreign Minister say that there is, of course, also the possibility of triggering, if things become worse in the next period, the mutual assistance clause. It is a proposal which we have often put on the table in the Socialist Party. It is not at the moment - I stress - but it is also a possibility for the future, which the Member States will also put before their responsibilities. Ladies and gentlemen, I close by saying that every house gives its battle on too many fronts. It is perhaps the biggest test that our country has been going through so far, at least. At the same time as the country is threatened by the Turkish challenges, jobs are being lost, businesses are being closed down, consumption is falling, but at the same time, children must go to school, the bills must be paid, the loans must be paid, we must stay protected and away from the virus and, of course, we must protect our elderly people as well as the vulnerable groups of the population. So in this huge trial for the Greek people we, the Change Movement, are next to him. We will not let this crisis become another opportunity for the few and a problem of survival for the many. Together we\'ll give these games! Together we will strengthen the demands and voice of the Greek people, Mr Mitsotakis, who are suffering at this time. And we will help with the struggles and our proposals at last to not only see the difficulties of everyday life, but look up, look forward, look forward, look at the horizon and hope again in a better perspective! So in the face of the conservative choices made by the government, propaganda and misinformation, populism, easy solutions and falsifications of Officerial Response, we, the Change Movement, respond with an integrated recovery plan for the place, a plan that we have already started and discussed with the forces of production, with the Greek society. This is the necessary leap forward that needs a place. It is a plan that the New Democracy does not want and cannot do, it is obvious, and of course even SYRIZA, as they are stuck in the past. The Change Movement, ladies and gentlemen, is a continuation of PASOK and an expression of the progressive party today. He\'s here for the new progressive change that this place needs. And we want, and we know, and we can do it. We\'ve left our mark in this place. We are therefore a shield for democracy and a support for society. It is precisely with this thinking that we have a hard opposition, but creative and always with alternative counterproposals! Thank you very much.']","<|system|>

At some point we have to understand that if we want to be serious and we support the continuation of the state, we support it in a certain way. So we are actually coming to conclude a previous legislative initiative, which had certainly created tension at that time - we know that very well - very well - very clear discernment within the SYRIZA, but the tactic that ""weeping, tearing the pages, but I sign and don\'t get the ink"", okay, we\'ve heard it many times. Let us not repeat the same thing. And don\'t give me up for my style, because that was your style earlier here in Stepma. So we have to say things by their name and put them in a certain order. So what are we going to do right now? To conclude, on the basis of the questionnaires sent and answered, the study carried out by the working party and the effort made by a legislative committee, which has worked for a long time under Law 4335, so that we have a modern Code of Civil Procedure. Of course, a central political choice is also added to this which is the implementation of the so-called pilot trial in civil justice. Yes, sir. I understand that there is a contradiction. I understand that there is concern. But, Mrs Giannakopoulos, you do well to raise the point you said that it was the PASOK that legislated the pilot trial in the administrative courts at the Council of State. Do you remember what intensity or, if necessary, did we seek to find out what intensity was at the time with this legacy? Today, almost ten years later, we are talking about an absolutely successful institution. In fact, in order to be honest, as unconstitutionalism was a repetitive term by many colleagues here in this Chamber, the question of whether the trial for the pilot trial in the Council of State has been judged many times. And do you know what the contradictions are to which you often find yourself? I\'m not addressing you, Mrs. Giannakopoulou. I would like to address my colleagues in general. It\'s the fact that when you don\'t find anything to catch, you\'re looking to find the only reason you\'re ever projecting. But there is no stability in this. It\'s ad hoc. Now that the Scientific Committee of Parliament has said nothing about unconstitutionalism, you have not invoked it. When I brought you opinions from the administrative plenary of the Ice Bay, you told me that these were not mandatory. Now you\'re saying why I didn\'t bring her. Look, ladies and gentlemen, the consistency and, in any case, the message that each of us sends to the citizens and to the Greek society I think is the reason why we are judged at all times and at all times. And I say this because the government\'s intention is to complete a specific reform programme in justice, which will give us the opportunity and the opportunity, on the one hand, to address the many and great sufferings that exist, but, above all, to give a firm signal, a firm signal to all Greek society and to all Greek citizens that they must feel safe from the functioning of justice. Really, is the pilot trial, ladies and gentlemen, to serve the banks and the funds? Really, is that your opinion? So, the ordinary citizen, who has been afflicted for more than a decade before taking a decision at three different levels of justice, does not fall within the scope of your own concern? The pilot trial, ladies and gentlemen, is in favour of our weak and vulnerable fellow citizens. We have made it clear from the start, because even the nature of the issues that will be considered through the pilot trial will actually give the solution and answer to people who are likely to suffer for a decade in a very short time. I realise that there is a reason, perhaps, for opposition, which may have its roots on different points, but in any case, it creates a political reason, an opposition reason, in order to have an opposing view. However, as I repeat that we are all judged by what we are trying to do and through what we say every time to Greek society, I think that to a very large extent the pilot trial will be judged for its success, but, of course, also for its effectiveness. Let a corresponding argument happened to hear a few months ago when we brought the law on the pending cases of the Katseli Act. You were saying exactly the same things, from unconstitutional to a case-law which is incomplete, which again does not favour the weak citizens, who, in any case, also strengthens whom, the banks, the funds and so on. What is the result today, ladies and gentlemen? Almost fifty thousand cases have joined the platform and are expected to be quickly cleared. In other words, this risk of space and the functioning of justice - I repeat, at least in my opinion - should not have space and place in this debate. Personally, I believe and still believe and will continue to say that justice is not a micropolitical confrontation. The area of justice is an area in which we must all take a serious, moderate and responsible approach, in order to support any process, but much more to give - I repeat - a firm message, to send a firm message to all Greek citizens that they must feel safe. Yes, sir. What is the greatest pathogen in the field of Greek justice? The delays in the time of justice. All colleagues have said so. Will the pilot trial, ladies and gentlemen, not address this problem partially? In other words, a case must be in three different stages, with conflicting judgments by courts. We\'ve seen it too many times. May I remind you of the Swiss franc case? May I remind you of issues which, to a very large extent, were, I would say, of particular legal interest, of great legal interest, difficult legal issues which the pilot trial is called upon to resolve? The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot, on the one hand, all come and very nice to judge or, at any rate, to see - to say a simpler word, a simpler word, a easier word - problems in the area of justice and, when solutions are proposed, simply by a statement or a complaint not only to propose something different, but simply to reject any solution. At the end of the day all of this is recorded and to a very large extent it is put into consideration by Greek society and Greek citizens. A huge debate is taking place on the new regular procedure, that there will no longer be a witness testimonial and that everything will be written. But I think that all of this is described very specifically - I do not remember whether it is only in Article 3 or in another article - that it is possible, at the discretion of the judge, even if he considers that the evidence or all the documents are not sufficient to form his viewpoint, he has the ability to call witnesses or, in any case, to call on all those who can, in their own testimony and in their own testimony, form their own right view and objective judgment. All that you say, ladies and gentlemen, is a climate that judges cannot judge and decide properly. And that\'s something that\'s too dangerous. We really must not let such an opinion and such an impression be cultivated if we really want to contribute to the proper functioning of justice. It is not possible for judges to be affected when talking about big-capital cases or what else I or the fund on the one hand, but on the other hand for them to be judges who decide in favour of retroactive pensioners. Pick. It\'s either on or on the other side. You cannot be on both sides and keep saying contradictory things. I say this because, once again, the efforts that have been made in recent years serves a specific reform plan. Yes, Mr. Mylonakis, we\'re changing all the codes. I\'ve already announced it. I\'ve said it from the Step of the House. That is why we have a positive report on the rule of law by the European Commission. I will come back to Mrs Jackés, since I do not really know what she might have read from the European Commission\'s report on the rule of law, but I am prepared to see - page and chapter - chapter where the positive results of the reforms and choices of the current government are and where the black references are and in which time there are. I\'ll say it again, ladies and gentlemen. I have to. Do you know that there is a vague positive viewpoint in the European Commission\'s report that this government is moving rapidly towards the digitisation of justice? Do you know that she is particularly pleased because we have set up special sections in Athens and Thessaloniki that will avenge investment more quickly? The fact that we legally set up the statistics office at the Ministry of Justice? Have you followed all this, ladies and gentlemen? You referred to delays. I do not remember which colleague spoke specifically about them. They are concerned that 2018 was five hundred ninety days while 2019 was six hundred thirty seven. They are referred to in another period they do not refer to the period of this governance. Also, Mr Xanthopoulou, I had no intention of repeating that reference is made to the report by the Government of the European Commission on Greece, and that it has been two years since the previous government had not made the active bribery. I guess you want me to repeat it. I didn\'t mean to do it, and I\'m telling you honestly. I will bring you to the next meeting the recommendations made by both GRECO and the OECD, and what might have been the \'threatening\' that had begun to be formulated for Greece with on-the-spot reports, which would degrade Greece in their classification of corruption in this table that exists in European reality. But all this, ladies and gentlemen, if you want to repeat it again, I have every intention to avoid it, to forget it in the debate. But if you bring it back, I\'m forced to say it again. And that\'s a reality about the previous government. Who told you that I now object to the validity or, in any case, to the ability of the really excellent teachers who were members of the legislator\'s committee? They were the same ones who gave the changes in mind. With the same people we talked and the people themselves are the ones who made the changes. They weren\'t different people. I don\'t want to get into a logic because that\'s what happened or why it\'s forgotten. Because I am sure that if you sit down and look at it not as a Member but as a legal person, you will see that it is not possible for active bribery to be a flood and all other forms of bribery to be a felony. Something\'s wrong. What is not going well, ladies and gentlemen, has been legislated on the days of the previous government and it is a matter of common sense. It\'s not about how one sees the law or how one wants to see certain specific issues. I think these are all issues that we have discussed. I would like to close them personally, I would like them to be exhausted. But the fact that you insist by arguing from the Step of the House gives me the opportunity to come back. New tactical procedure. You haven\'t decided if you want her or you don\'t want her. It\'s like you temporarily voted in 2015 and then you say, ""Get it out. We voted for it. You\'re the one to take it off."" But do you want to see what the truth is, ladies and gentlemen? The truth arises with the actual statistics and with the actual number of cases pending with the old tactics and pending today. In 2015, therefore, eighty-six thousand and twenty-three cases were pending in all the prefectures. As of 2016, cases for the same statistical period pending are fifty-two thousand eight hundred and fifty-six. You realise that the reduction of cases is too great. And that should not be ignored if we really want to protect Greek citizens from the very long time of justice. Some here characterizing or speaking of the great year of justice even spoke of denial. Yeah, that could even be heard. However, if we want to face such problems, ladies and gentlemen, we must all understand that we must support reforms and strengthen the reform effort in the area of justice. By stagnating or by closing the eye or, if you would like, clearly, I would say, approaching populism on certain issues, we will not respond or give a solution to the great problems that exist in the area of justice. I\'m not one of those who deny reality. However, I am one of those who I regard as my duty to do my utmost to deal with problems and diseases in the field of justice. This must be done without having second and third thoughts, or possibly seeing the bureaucratic process in front of it as an impediment or an obstacle to taking the necessary steps. All this could be seen through many other issues. An entire debate and a lot of references were made to the auctions. We have not altered the debtor\'s right of opposition to ask the court for an increase in the first offer of the property. That\'s what I think you\'ve recorded. You know that. This article remains unchanged in paragraph 4 of 954. And, of course, the price is starting and not the sale price. That\'s what we\'ve been through. The fact that there is a pillow that reaches the third auction in 65% of the value of the property is just so that the properties are not given for a piece of bread. It is precisely for the opposite reason from what you are referring to, ladies and gentlemen. As we speak of auctions and as we need to know what the reality is, I want to present you with the European Commission report of June 2019, which again talks about the previous government\'s commitment to completing the issue of auctions. I would like you to see it, Mr Xanthopoulou, because with it next time, if you want to talk about it again, I will also give you the real elements of the auctions, namely, how many auctions were made on SYRIZA and what effort has been made so far to either postpone or protect our vulnerable citizens from many legislative initiatives by this government. But I imagine you understand that the rule of law has all the appearances. Obviously they must be seen and supported. [[At this point, the Minister for Justice, Mr Constantine Tsiaras, presents for the minutes the above document, which is in the archives of the Secretariat Department of Parliament\'s Directorate for Stenography and Practice]] There are many issues which I think the ladies and gentlemen have raised from this step. Most of the answers to this level were given earlier by the State Secretary, Mr Kotsiras. But when, ladies and gentlemen, you come to me and say to me, for example, that with Article 62 we are actually creating an anachronistic institution - I am talking about judges who can see, in any case - I think either you have not followed the debate that took place in the committee with the presence of all the bodies or on the other hand we must refuse something that is generally acceptable. In any case, all the questions put as questions you know very well that they are resolved and answered by the court itself. They are not matters which one needs to describe in the analysis of this article. But if we want to be absolutely honest with each other, I think we all have to accept that at this time in particular there are many steps to deal with the pathogens of the past. There is a new era that one needs to see with adaptations, with changes, with reforms, with very targeted modernisation, which, to a very large extent, will also give answers to many questions relating to the area of justice. There is the amendment from the Ministry of Justice, which I had not been able to present earlier, and that is why I will be allowed to tell you some thoughts. Article 1 of that amendment sets out in the scope of the legal aid for fair satisfaction due to the overrun of the reasonable duration of the proceedings and the procedure before the judicial boards. This regulation also achieves the country\'s compliance with a decision of the European Court of Human Rights and abolishes the infringement of Article 6 of the ECHR. I think you know that. Article 2 provides for the automatic deferral of the case in the event of the absence of the lawyer appointed in the context of legal aid in criminal matters to the court by means of a direct notification to the proprietor of the reason for the deferral and of the new law. In this way, once again, the country\'s compliance with decisions of the HRC is achieved, and the obligation of that lawyer to act in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Law. Article 3 is intended to guarantee the proper functioning of the General Committee of the ordinary administrative courts through the immediate completion of the posts of the Vice-Presidents who will become vacant on 30 June, due to their retirement, as the age limit is reached. Article 4 provides for the possibility of covering the institutional positions of the Informatics Division of the Regular Administrative Courts and by transfer or transfer of already non-judiciary officials, in order to meet their needs without delay to qualified staff, in particular to support the ICM. Article 5 actually includes the Minister of Finance in signing the Joint Ministerial Decision on the manner and time of payment of the insurance contributions by European Prosecutors, as well as the technical mediation of services and the Ministry of Justice. You realise that the ministerial amendments are accepted. There was an amendment by SYRIZA colleagues too late. Well, at least I\'m being informed by my partners, it\'s not the Ministry of Justice, it\'s the first department to be responsible, but the second to be responsible. I have the impression, Mr Xanthopoulou, that it is an issue that we can see. At first sight, it seems to have reason to consider it and with caution to see exactly where it is. Finally, I would like to reply to Mrs Konnakka. The question of the payment of legal aid is a huge issue, which I personally have been dealing with for two and a half years. This is because, on the basis of the existing legislation of the FIFG, and given that there must be the exclusive right to sign certain people, in order to clear up the pending legal aid cases and given that there is a serious undermining of the FIFG, there is an objective problem. We have made an effort with the administration of the Plenary Assembly and, in particular, with the President, to find a solution so that at least a sum can be paid ahead of the final liquidation. And I do not hide from you that we were at least too close to approaching and resolving this particular issue, as I mentioned it to you. However, because you realise that there must be a combination of the provisions of the Ministry of Finance and others\' competence, we have not been able to be ready at the moment. That is why this article has been replaced by an authorisation granted in order to complete this procedure. I think it is incomprehensible and I am really sorry for what is happening. It\'s a shame. It is a reality that we know over a period of time. It is precisely the same reality that existed with the previous government. However, the point is that while there is the possibility of paying this money, there is no procedure to support the real liquidation of these cases. And I do not hide from you that I and my colleagues have consumed a very large number of hours, really many hours, in order to find a solution to this issue. Ladies and gentlemen, we could really talk a lot of time about matters in both the bill and justice in general. The truth is that in recent years we have completed an effort that, as I said, we had started earlier. We have already voted for the new Code of Justice, we have completed with two bills the new procedure of the Court of Auditors and we are coming today to close the gap with the changes to the Code of Civil Procedure. The Criminal Code is coming and, of course, all these issues that have dealt with us to a very great extent. I think the next two bills will concern, on the one hand, the reform of the ECHR, the National School of Judges and, on the other hand, the new body of courts and tribunals. In this way we are practically completing a very large reformist intervention in the area of justice. I will repeat what I have said many times. Three are the pillars of justice: they are people, judiciary, judicial officers and, of course, the officials of justice, that is, the procedures for jurisprudence, the way in which matters are approached, or even electronicisation, the digitisation of justice which we are promoting very rapidly, and of course infrastructures, buildings. As you mentioned the buildings, you know that the first PPP concerning central Macedonia has already gone ahead and we have already announced the public international competition for the new Piraeus Judicial Palace. There is planning work on two more PPPs in different geographical areas of the country and of course we have succeeded and have completed the construction of the new Athens Court of First Instance through the Recovery Fund just behind the court in order to have a modern prototype in the capital, to solve and respond to problems of decades, which, for a very long time, were not touching and no one was facing. I repeat, however, that all of this serves a truly organised reform plan, which we are actually completing, we are fulfilling a step, a step very carefully and very much, if you want, a sense of responsibility and all that we need to do specifically in the area of justice. We are modernising justice, ladies and gentlemen. We reform it in order to face pathogens and create better conditions and better conditions for justice. You know, ladies and gentlemen, the cubit that each of us puts, whether at a personal level or at a transmissible level, is specific. Some people go through the bar from the top. Some people are passing him underneath. The point is that the Greek citizens see us, and they watch us, and judge us. I think that what each one of us must keep, regardless of whether I repeat his political position or the more general ideological view that he can support and serve, is that at the end of the day society and our citizens are judging. Thank you very much.', ""Thank you, Mrs. President. Good afternoon, everyone. Good evening, all of you who have come to our guests this evening, and thank you very much. And good evening, Mr. Urkullu. I have come to hear and to understand, because I have always given a great deal of importance to this exercise of listening and acting. But in proportion as I have heard you, my uneasiness has increased, because I have not found it in balance, nor in the extreme challenges of the future, any strength and determination to resist. The Conservative is a kind of suggestion that you put on the table of a government that does not know what direction it is or what direction it is. In the name of Realism, your government seems to offer a paralyzing conformism, and it is as dangerous as to propose impossible challenges to reject a collective effort to obtain a difficult but attainable challenge. Today, you took us to 1800, the year 1962, Kennedy deflated by challenging the United States of America to arrive in the moon during that decade. But he added a little reflection, and said that he had not suggested it because it was easy, but because it was difficult. And I'm interested in that reflection. This government shows a lack of illusions and lack of collective motivation and impassibility to create and encourage. Look, I'll give you some examples. As a purpose, you proposed to us, in our investigation and development, to reach the average of one European when we were a few years ago above. The purpose is to get off the job for 10 percent of unemployment. European record, but negative record, Mr. Urkullu. As far as school is concerned, you plan to build below 7% when it's already 6,5%. Or, what to say about 10% of the birth rate. You propose to invite us into the midst of ten people who have the best index in equality, when we are ninth, but when we were fifth. So we're backing out. And in this situation, with that lack of leadership, I've been heard today as fireworks than future projects. Beyond the fireworks, anyway, it's time to count, Mr. Urkullu. And we've heard you call self-critic glory. But afterwards, in your discourse, it has not been so. It has certainly been a political year under the condition of the legemels; The Basque Country is 5925 people dead. And our love (... I want to send them all. We know it's been a very difficult management of the palace. But behind this difficulty we cannot hide, and we must seriously reflect on the defects or the privations which have been in all these months, or the mistakes you have spoken of. Teaching them out. I've told you this before. We've been chasing the virus. This government doesn't know the different times of panic, and they read what they asked for. The communicative political strategy is sometimes won by a sanitarian scientific strategy. This government has placed the image above efficiency, principally by placing it in a restrictive measure, and making decisions without consistency, or, if not consistent, at one time and the other. And what has become of the law, Mr. Urkullu, covid? What was the use of the Covid law?... [[End of tape 30]] [[31st beginning of tape]] ...or if the rocket isn't in one and the other. And what has become of the law, Mr. Urkullu, covid? What did the Covid law do for? Well, you said it was supposed to give us legal security, but it doesn't give us legal security. And so the citizens have been unable to understand whether professional health professionals, who have seen themselves growing more and more strict, and who, in the crudest part of this pandemy, have lived in the most serious state of their furs, residents, relations, and workers, or sectors of damage which these measures have been injured. And you, Mr. Urkullu, we saw you angry, always angry, always guilty. And one of the most obvious examples is the general criticism of the young. I don't deny, I don't deny that some young men, like adults, had, by the way, improper behaviors, indiscreet ones, very inadequate. But I really think that falling into general decalations is only breaking the tension between generations. There has been much talk of young men, but it has not really been seen or refused to see what being young in the midst of a pandemy is and what consequences it has. And I don't know whether we are conscious of what this may be supposed in the terms of challenge. I think we ought to talk a great deal about the future of the young men, and about the pretty things directed to them, to give their future light. On the other hand, Mr. Urkullu, you made up your mind to manage only pandemy. You remind us of your entire majority, and maybe that's your greatest weakness. Yes, Mr. Urkullu. The Basque Country carried you several proposals on the table, which you didn't even answer, and which later, in months, you've used out of place and out of order. You did this, and things could be done differently. When the cares are shared, the consequences are shared, but you don't share the responsibility, and that's your responsibility. Now we need a change, instead of based on a general reduction, by increasing preventive measures, by pushing the people's powers, by identifying and reorganizing the weakest sectors, if the injured sectors are to be harmed or taken under any measures, helping the sectors from the beginning, and doing the necessary physical measures. Prefectation and public health must be prepared for new times. I think we've lost time to take structure measures at this time, but let's do it: First attention, emergency, ethemological units, mental health, mental health, mental health, I repeat, chronic diseases, necessary pandemia, and now indispensable. The change is time, and change itself has become a new paradigm. And in front of that, Mr. Urkullu, the stability of your government is also taking shape in stability. In those days, if we do not make decisions as a people, we may find ourselves in a situation impossible to return; not only us, but the future of our descendants is at stake. Everything moves, everything perverts, changes from our desires, and our certainties fall. And in that context, the people feel a bit of fun, afraid of the future. And the fear of the future would often bring rise to the autoritation of evolution. We're seeing in several countries in Europe, and we're even seeing it in the Spanish State. And I wouldn't want to let it go without the constant attack of LGTB+ collective here and out of here. Unacceptable. And Mr. Agenza has already said that some of them commit hatred and spread hatred, and others make this hatred into terrible blows and attacks. The challenge of a responsible government is to offer a new security system, a strong protection for the future, a new order. And together with the climate crisis, and I'll speak more calmly later, if the elevation of social differences is also the failure of the global neolial socialization. And we're not safe here either. The necessity of meeting the flow of migration, as a people, seems to me very important, and as far as we are the signor of the treaty, we have an obligation to it. And a special allusion is to the demographic balance, to the minimum of historical birth rates, and the family of your government has not upset that tendency. I think there's some pretty young lawmaking that hasn't been there, and it doesn't seem like the Young Law will go any further in that sense. We have great challenges, and we have a few compasses to look at those challenges: ecology, feminism, mutual care, social justice, and the common identity rooted in the country of our culture, these compasses. And rights, all rights for all people. And speaking of rights to all people, I mean, as has been said before, it will soon be over since the Peace Conference at Aiete ten years ago. The only point of that path is complete. I remember when you were president of the Eudedi Controller's Council, you remarked that this first point was to be fulfilled. Only that first point has been completed. And after ten years we can say that we're better, we can't deny it, but there's still so much left to establish a lasting and complete peace. We plunged into a short-ranged discussion and amputation, mixed up in an old relatto, unable to improve the present and the future. Steps have been given in the conditions of the prisoner's life, as the map of dispertion represents, but the exceptions, the legislation, and the threats of the tribunals still follow. They're making trial of 13/13 in the Spanish National Court. A macrobook based on statements made under torture, we have been able to hear horrible witnesses of torture, and there is something to think about. Before all the victims were admitted and observed, the gradation and disorganisation of certain victims has been maintained. And I think that's the way you're going to meet him and just give him the steps to fix him once and for all... [[31st end of tape]] [[Start of tape 32]] ... it has also been perpetuated by the institutional gradation and neglect. And I think it will be necessary to lead them on, and to give them time to settle for ever, for a lasting peace and for a living. And that's the commitment to the Basque People gathering. To seek a happy future for all the human dramas that have happened in this country, the rights of human rights are the axis of the dignity of all the people. I told you there were some things I wanted to study a little before. And one of them is a challenge of climate and energy. In fact, if we're talking about the future, Mr. Urkullu, we need to talk deeply of climate and energy. The scientific evidence is beyond doubt, and the shocks we're living are multiplying, and there's nothing but looking at the summer. In Canada or poles or a thousand examples, I will not repeat them here. And, Mr. Urkullu, we're not very well placed. Our temporal transition is paradigmatic. And that's the result of a long and obstinate strategy connected to the gas. And in the reduction of fluids causing climate change, data is hopeless. And one data reflects your mind well. Since you've been president, Mr. Urkullu, and a few years ago, we've only had a few more buttons. But instead of accepting failure with humility, you try to hide the problem by twisting the data. The situation demands acceptance of the crudeness of reality, and a bold decision to make a deep alliance between the nation and the house. Because the ecological transition transcends you and your government, because it's the responsibility of everyone, because it's something that affects the next generation. And I think it's time to start sending lights. The precise size of the gas-use, as has been mentioned here several times, is to be fined, the Basque agency of energy must put off fossils in Europe. 2 the ends of inclination must be grafted in the law of the climate. We need to reflect the ambition. And you have our hand open for that job. And polishing the climate and energy transition requires other things, such as waste politics. And as I'm talking about the waste policy, Mr. Urkullu, I'd like to remember what you said about the Horsebar. You said your responsibility is to try not to happen again. But it's your responsibility to find political responsibility for everything that happened. That's your responsibility, too. But, as I was saying, a decent transition will require another policy of ruin, as it will require, a movement, a house, food, industry, land planning. He's gonna ask for other policies. And all this without destroying social cohesion. So it's a good job. We don't have a lot of work to do. Therefore, if we must necessarily be in Madrid and Brussels, we must take measures in front of the scandalal elevation of the lighthouse. Mr. Urkullu, as well as here, is multiplying the number of people who can't use any other energy to ensure the worthy condition of life. And in winter, it could explode. And our screen system has to be told in front of this new emergency. The bill of law-proposital welfare that you've withdrawn from us. But we should resume what we've got there, because we have a chance of having one here, and we have a responsibility. In this context, we will enter the phase of a economic recovery in a phase of recovery. And the funds in Europe can be hooks, but if we've learned something in the past crisis and pandemies, it's true, and you've also spoken of teaching, what kind of recovery we want. And I also think that we should discuss. Because, otherwise, there are people who can't continue as they did in the previous crisis. And we'd have to step forward enough to leave someone behind us. You're talking about total snobbishness, but you've introduced us to the resurrect plan. And that doesn't have anything to do with it. I've just mentioned your proposal in economic areas, it's easy to sum up. You want to move forward, but backing up. It's the backward steps we've found here. You're trying to sell us the unemployment rate is a good ten percent when it's a step back, averaged European at 7%. And especially the young and the women, you have not made any proposal to face the premium. To formulate any employment objective for this country that is not moving towards full quality employment is not to have an employment strategy, and more so in a gigantic labour market relief scenario, with the massive retirement process that will take place in that decade, 500,000 jobs, Mr Urkullu, 500,000 opportunities to do better. The abolishing of the Law of Job in the Spanish State is the first step, on the other hand. And there's need to be a collision plan against the working strip that's the right result of precarnation. More than 120 people have died in the Basque Country for the past three years. And that's terrible. And it is necessary that the minimum wage should be of the size of the cost of life of our country, and consequently here to decide. In the midst of this technological revolution we live in, a wager for research and development is indispensable. And it's been years since Collecting the Basque Country has said that it would be necessary to make a great compact between the various agents, to lead to three percent of the raw internal exploitation and development. We think it's vital, Mr. Urkullu. And another important axis is digitalization. You also said the digitalization you mentioned and the government strategy. But I think the name of strategy is big. Digitization is not buying some computers. Our life is a process that will change from top to bottom. Our DNA? They're touching it. And that will cause risks and chances. Our country must be prepared to take advantage of these chances and face these risks, because it will change our lives and because we can't accept the rifts. Digitization and investigation are the basis of a strong industrial political transition, together with the neurological and ecological transition at the present day. And that's really a bet on the industry in this town. We've been asking for the root fund for years, but it hasn't started. And this year we've seen Euscalel get into the hands of foreign funds. And then you tell us we'll be at the champions. [[End of tape 32]] [[XXII. The beginning of the tape.]] ... But it hasn't started. And this year we've seen Euscalel get into the hands of foreign funds. And then you tell us we'll be at the Champs-Elysees, and you'll be at the Champion of excuses, but this is one thing that could be foreseen and what happened. And though there have been difficulties in many sectors, yet we have seen them start out in so many other companies, and take upon them as excuses: Petror, we saw the workers of Tubacex here this morning, ITP, Aernova, H &M. And your government has always been lined up next to the patrician, and the majority against the syndicate. We need to talk about the watch pattern, too. You have proposed to encourage transitional policies when you speak, and we would say that you have made a certain full correction to what has hitherto been proposed, because it is already indissoluble that the ruin of the watch system is already indisputable. Around the retreats, the only thing to remark on your part is the protocol, so I'll tell you by the way, I thought it was no time. But in any case, watchers are the founder of social differences, and, owing to your political choice, they are those who have created feminists, opticians, and men. We shall discuss this also in the law of equality; it will be indispensable to speak of it in this law of equality. This compels us to accept the universal property necessary for care. One of our great wants is to get out of the guard's field and to create organizations that guard and guard them. You told us that social policies have improved, but maybe we should ask the residents, relatives and workers. And we need to talk about protection, too. The social differences in the Araba, the Biscaia, and the Gipu, and there are 22,500 people in danger of falling into a state of severe poverty. And the opportunity may open a window if the minimum income to live is made full transfer, and it should come as a whole to guarantee the incomes for the maintenance and opening of our own system in the rent reform. To attain all these goals, science, prepared in the first row, must be well paid. And education is at the base of all that. And Esscal is stopping at high school. In the past ten times, if in a great measure of public initiatives the hinges have been answered, we are not able to advance a steady step in the process of construction of our education system, and to accommodate ourselves to new times. COVID-19 has, however long it may be observed, discovered a contaminatement: education system is out of date. He cannot answer the roots of future times as a people, and satisfy all the needs of his pupils. I mean, by the downfall of birth, by different segregations, or by the extreme resolutions of life, not to be here, as others. But we believe that this people has sufficient ability to rethink and interpret the model of education. This, indeed, ought to be established among the different kinds of society, among parties, among the agents of education, amongst schools, and among the people, new complicity must be established. We need to give this time, Mr. Urkullu. And from the United States of Euscala, we confirm the will and commitment to an education agreement. I'd like to mention the situation as a Basque. It has something to do with education, but what education is we won't ask, and there are other systems that have to be produced. But when I mention the situation of the eucalyptus, I must mention, systematically, the intolerable attacks which I am afraid of. It's no coincidence that attacks appear now. They have a certain political purpose, and they are clearly connected with the political competition of those who believe that they will lose a place for the assault of the ultra right and the right ultra right, with those who are ready to sleep. We have to guarantee the use of the Basque. It's a challenge to fit in all the next changes and spread them all around. It is also time for us to build ecosystems, to adapt to language policy, to adapt ourselves to these female tenets, and to take initiative and leadership on the path suggested by the operators on the side of the eucalyptus. To hit what has been said before, I would like to insist on the need of a powerful public sector. In this sense the public security network is indispensable, and likewise the direct public intervention to promote the modification of the economy. Without complexities, public corporations must be pushed behind liberal topi. To extend the public service network, we need economic resources to strengthen the public sector and direction the transformation. And those are gonna have to be done by tax. It's time to start the integral form of taxes to finance the protection of our society's needs and strategic changes. You didn't mention it, Mr. Urkullu, but the special measures we have to take now to deal with the hinges before us, to answer when there is not much stream of money, because a form of tax was not made in two days, and it will be indispensable. You've talked about the investuns, and you've already proposed to do this with the remanents. Well, I'll ask you a question. Was he a realist or wasn't he what the Basque People said? Was it a fake? Was it a fake? Was there money or wasn't there to strengthen health or protect damaged sectors? Now, all you have to do is find out which way to use these funds. You mentioned the partnership. We, with the European funds, have offered assembling, and have received no answer. But it's not a pretence, and in front of these challenges you'll have that invitation to each other again. We need the ability to face all of these challenges, and we don't. And it's time to make decisions. It's been years since we've postponed the debate, listening to the general, general, self-referring call. And again and again, reality shows that we don't go any further. And we must still hear, in some cases, that, for instance, on your side President, we are not in a hurry, I once told Mr. Egibar that we would be in eternity. But now we have... [[End 33 tape]] [[Start of tape 34]] ... As for the President, we are not in a hurry; I once told Mr. Egibar that we should be in eternity. But now we're in a hurry because we don't have enough instruments that people need, and because we don't have the instruments we need to answer. This is the government we have, which accuses the oppression of auto-generacy, and at the same time says that which the right of deciding leads us to half-time, as PSOE says. It seems to be a two-sided government, but really, at the time of truth, which always accepts right. Mr. Vinez used to say that we agreed on 80% of Autogobernu Poncia. If, then, there is no ability to advance, or if we do not advance, there will be a minimum of respect for a majority. You have asked us today about full foral reintegration, and I would like to know whether this has been consulted with your partner. Ze XXI. Mendean, ez dakit, nahikoa da foruen bereskuratze osoa herri honori irtenbidi bat emateko? Eztabaida akademiko battik harago nahikoa da? Time for the exit of the lehenengo galdera. Baina, is the full external reintegration decoded in terms of the 21st century called the Basque State, Mr Urkullu? Is this what you meant? And if this is so, here is Autogobernu Poncia, here are the principles and principles of Autogobernu Poncia. We accepted the principles and principles together with Poseidon for a while. We're here, Mr. Urkullu. And what I'm asking is where you are. In front of this majority, this government, or this part of this government, is concerned with. And I've seen a recipe in your speech, Mr. Urkullu. The right to decide has vanished from your speech, and I have really thought it disturbing. because it condemns this people to submit, and because they deny a dispute to this people. Look, Mr. Urkullu, you put it up for 2015 to consult this town yourself. You said the right to make decisions for 2020 would be operational, if I'm not mistaken, I remember the last in New York, Columbia University. And I want to ask you where your word is. Herritarren % 70ak inkesten arabira dio wasbakitzeko eskubideeren alde dagoela. Horrek ez of the baliorik Gobernu honored? Let us not trap the lonely, you know that the time has come to move forward and enter a resolute phase. It's time to tell the truth. Whether we believe in democracy and the decisions that this people make or do not believe. Because that is what it is about, democracy, respect for the majority will of this people, that we can all defend and also materialize our democratic political projects, if they have the support of the majority. Some have that opportunity, others don't have it, we don't have it. And through your speech you have spoken with sincerity, and let us tell this people what the proposition of each of them is. I'll tell you again, the Basque Country is here to collect. We agreed on these principles and principles in Autogone Poncia with the Jestral Party and together with Podemos. I'm going to finish. It is necessary, as society, to discuss the direction of certain ends in shared ways, so that the powers of this country should not be divided, but that they should be agreed and concentrated on these ends. I told you the entries that appear in the latest version of the Euskadi A.H.C.s. I told you that one day I thought it best to reflect what the future of our country should be, but it must not be rhetoric, it must not be rhetoric. We agree with what is said here, that from this shared point of view there may arise great possibilities. We need political plans, and time is running out. The pandemic has accelerated digital development, and there are only a few years to achieve a radical energy transformation, to abandon fossil fuels, to drastically reduce emissions if we really want to avoid an out-of-control climate disorder. We are facing an historic port, and three terrible revolutions: Mythical ecological, digital and demographic. And we have to put all the forces in this town in the right direction. And we know that it is necessary to unite forces in a well-defined country project. We are prepared to give our best, and we believe that in the presence of the three great crisis, about five great axiss, it is necessary to establish a pact between generations, and thus we wish to point out to this people. One: Climate neutrality. A hundred socionomical Euscali integration strategy completely. Two: the whole employment of quality, the loss of labour, of labour, of division, of wages, or of relations of labour. Three: to build a public watch system, to ensure maintenance of the veins. Moreover, we find it necessary to meet with this demographic reality, which threatens to increase the character of a genus. All this requires a deep community sense, a sense of belonging to an open and supportive community, and in an era of uprooting and identity crisis in which with the same strength as the need for material security is manifested as belonging, every transformative proposal must be entangled with the beliefs or memory most rooted in the national imagination. And here we have the concept of a nation proposed by Joseba Sarrionandia, a space of communication. And therefore to this compact of generation we must add two other duties: euscal educational system, inspired in the most advanced northern systems of Europe, will establish the basis of a genuine pedagogical revolution, the perfect normalization of education and the total normalisation of the eucalyptic social eloquence in favor of a national pact for a language that will activate the opportunity to achieve euscalized eloquence. These are missions, these missions we need tools to arrive and perform. That's why I announced... [[End of tape 34]] [[Beginning of tape 35.]] ... a national pact for one. These are missions, these missions we need tools to arrive and perform. That is why I have proclaimed the necessity of a new state. You spoke of happiness, Mr. Urkullu, and I want a happy society too. That's what we all want. But do you know that only 12% of the young people of our day will think he'll be happier than his parents? Maybe that ought to give us a thought. Thank you."", 'Mr President, Senators, Senators, the European Council which starts tomorrow takes place a few hours away from an extraordinary summit of the Heads of State and Government of the euro area, on the crisis situation in Greece, in the relationship between the Greek Government and the European financial and economic institutions. It can therefore be assumed that, regardless of the agenda, the subject of greatest impact, alongside that of immigration - on which I will come shortly - will be the relationship between Greece and Europe, between the permanence of Greece within the euro area and the possibility for financial and economic institutions to write a new page, starting from both the contingent situation, i.e. the Hellenic condition, and the report of the four Presidents that should be presented. Therefore, I propose that you draw your attention essentially to two major issues of discussion, on which to focus Italy\'s position: the economic and financial aspect, linked to the Greek situation and the report of the four Presidents, and the migration issue, which should be addressed on Friday, also in the light of the decisions already taken by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence, as well as by the Ministers for the Interior. Of course you will forgive me if I devote less space to other issues, which are particularly interesting for us too; indeed, they are decisive and crucial because - I would like to highlight this with a big marker - the agenda of the discussion of the next few hours will contain some of the issues of which more than others we have highlighted the importance during our semester. I am referring to the digital agenda, to the need to have more attention on growth and employment issues, but also to a comprehensive European strategy that - let\'s face it all - has to deal with itself after years when Europe has probably failed to demonstrate the same intensity and strength that it itself set itself as its goal in the Lisbon Strategy for 2020. It will therefore also be these central themes of the debate, starting from the assumption that the Italian position on them is widely shared, including within Parliament. In other words, there is a need to stress not only the Stability Pact but the final part of it, the Stability and Growth Pact, and therefore the need to set up a European economic idea differently. On these issues, I believe we can take as a point of reference the considerations we have already made during previous communications, previous statements and votes on motions, in some cases also shared with at least part of the opposition. I\'m trying to be very synthetic. The first point concerns the economic situation in both Greece and Europe. We are in the presence of a financial turbulence that, for the first time in four years, does not concern Italy. It\'s a fact. Who of us, on opposing sides, does not remember the images from Cannes onwards - then it was a G20 summit, not a European summit, in which, however, there was a clear European leadership - until the events of the last few months, when there were problems in the financial and economic markets? Italy always ended up not saying on the bench of the defendants, but certainly on the side of the table left to the students, who had to prove whether things were doing it or not and whether they were prepared. In those examinations, Italy took on the role of the student to whom to ask for the verification of commitments made. It\'s not like that today. And of course this is not enough for me, it is necessary but not enough, because the signs of economic recovery, which are undeniable and indisputable, are still, in our opinion, timid. There is still much to be done, first and foremost in terms of the unblocking of infrastructure and construction sites. We have recently taken stock of the situation, imagining that at least 1% of GDP is the value of public works blocked for delays or problems between institutions, and it is an incredible figure at a time of difficulties such as the current one. Then, all the more so, we need an even stronger effort than Parliament and the Government in this direction. But the key point is that, if today Italy is in a position to no longer be on the bench of the accused or of the students to be examined, it is not due to magical phenomena coming from outside, but - I mean here with much loyalty - to parliamentary activity, because the real fund saves States of Italy this year has been the ability to make structural reforms. I express myself in a less shrewd way. We have finally achieved a structural reform project that still needs to be implemented. If we can say that we have closed down certain reforms (work, electoral law), we still have work to do on the public administration and the civil justice system, as well as of course on the issue of constitutional reform, which must be concluded. This gave the Italian ruling class the authority dictated not simply by the role of individual ministers or the President of the Council, but by the fact of representing a country that, after years of more or less shared discussions, finally realizes the things that it assured to do within its parliamentary classrooms. I would like this passage to be clear, because it is the starting point for any debate. Then we know that there are different views within us on individual reforms, but structural reforms are the safeguard clause that allows Italy to sit for the first time, in a system of financial turbulence, on the side of those who are safe, and not on the side of those who are under consideration. From this point of view we must have the courage to tell us that, if the path still has spaces of action and improvement, we have nevertheless brought home some measures and others will be the subject of discussion already in the next few hours. I am referring, for example, to the decree-law which the Government passed yesterday and which, after the provision on popular banks, constitutes a further element of reorganization of the credit system, on which there will be different opinions within Parliament, but which constitutes the desire to finally put an end to a debate that has been held in Europe, even with anti-Italian accents, for too long. This package of reforms is for us the instrument of certainty, the safety belt compared to what we are experiencing. It is not enough, however, because there is a double priority in the debate that opens tomorrow afternoon on this issue. The first is to say that, if it is true for us, it must be true for everyone else. We say this with great affection to our friends who lead the Greek Government. A journalist asked me what Rome says in Athens. If we have to say something from Rome to Athens, we do it in Latin: ""Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas."" There is no doubt that the clarity of positions is rewarding with respect to the more or less strong harmony on the issues of the need for a change in the direction of economic policy. In other words, the Greeks and the Greek Government must know - and we tell them with the affection of friends and with the closeness of those who know the difficulties that the Greek people have suffered in recent years - that there is a very strong pressure of part of European public opinion, in particular of some countries, to use the window that opens as an opportunity to close the accounts with Greece and to eliminate once and for all the issue of its presence in the euro area. We have said that with this frankness. There is no relationship of friendship that can prevail over the risk that the people run in view of the climate has been created, especially in some countries of the euro area. And I am referring not only to those of the oldest European tables, but also to those that entered after, in the second wave of European enlargement, which paradoxically today see the need to give more or less convincing answers to their public opinions on the subject of Greece. Greece must therefore know that there is a large number of political and institutional leaders in the European institutions who will do everything to help it, because this is right and proper. In addition, alongside the obligation of the Greeks to respect European rules, there is also a moral obligation, historical and linked to the recent past to the Greek people. But - this is the key point - even in the case of the Greek Government, the effort must be reciprocal. In this sense, I believe that the work of the Eurogroup - and I thank the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance for what he has done - and the work of the last few hours, which may not be completed in the European Council (the deadline is set at the end of the month for reasons that you all know), must see a strong, determined and tenacious awareness of the risks that would arise if the agreement did not come about; risks that are running - I must say the truth - particularly in that country to which many of us are bound by a feeling of gratitude and affection. I shall conclude this point by adding a final word, a postscriptum: we have said that we must insist on the report of the four Presidents so that the debate is real. The first drafts that circulate are interesting. Let me say, however, that I am a little shy in relation to the contribution that Italy has made to the debate. We have said that Italy no longer suffers from the risk of financial turbulence, because the structural reforms that Parliament has made and is making enable it to look at the present and the future with much greater serenity. [[Comments of Senator Bottici]] We have said that we need investment in innovation in the economic debate. However, there is a further step, which will then also return to the final issue of immigration and the overall agenda: Italy needs to live this discussion with even greater protagonism. This applies first of all to us, to the Government. We must probably identify some places of reflection, places of university and research. I myself will be in Berlin next week, in a prestigious university. The relevant ministers are working on this issue. It is necessary for the competent Commissions and the people who work in Parliament to report to the national press, as they are doing - surely they must be helped to emerge even more - the message that, without Italy\'s voice, the European economic debate is less strong. For the past four years, we\'ve been worried about saving our lives. We stopped debating at European level, giving any horizon or vision because, when we did - and it was of course done at all levels - the first reaction was: you say it because you need to save Italy. In fact, according to a strong prejudice in the debate within the European public, the position of the beautiful country was still affected by a marked national interest. Today, however, that the situation is finally becoming more normal, there is still a need for Italy, which is consistent with its cultural, philosophical and intellectual history - not only from the Treaty of Rome onward - to be able to make its voice heard more and more in the European political and economic debate. Let\'s be honest: from 2000 to 2015 Europe was not what Lisbon had designed, that is, the place of the greatest possible innovation in the history of the planet. Europe, after Lisbon, had to and wanted to be the continent of innovation, talents, patents, quality, economic growth and investment in employment. Instead, if we look at the results from 2000 to 2015, as Europe we have lost positions. We have seen other realities emerge and Europe has slowed down - it has not stopped - and the fact that some countries - not all - have gone well cannot be an obstacle, an alibi for those same countries not to open a deep discussion. From 2000 to 2015 the great European dream of making Europe the home of innovation has failed and there is no one who can say otherwise. Europe continues to be the home of civilization, the home of values, the place where ideals are given and defended (we are at the forefront of the battle for environmental sustainability). But on the subject of economic innovation, over the past fifteen years, Europe has missed the blow. That is why Italy needs to return to Italy in the political, cultural and academic debate. The second point on which a large part of the debate will be played is what more than anyone else, at the moment, occupies the television discussion in Italy, but also the media discussion in Europe. I consider it a good thing that we are talking about it, and I am not afraid that we are often talking about it with demagogic and worrying accents, because the ability to find the right words is up to a political class that has to do this, otherwise it is not credible. This is therefore a challenge that I intend to take to the end, knowing that it is not easy and that it has always crossed the Italian and European left with difficulty, but also the other political forces that make up the Government. It is in fact very difficult to manage the immigration issue by finding a right way between the danger and the fear it creates and the need for a solution that is not a structural failure to goodness and superficiality. It\'s not easy. It has never been easy and it will not be easy in the next few months. I know that on 24 June last year I was in the Senate, with you, to present the European Council. There was no talk, basically, of immigration. This was discussed, it was reasoned, but the debate focused mainly on economic issues and on the need for Italy to leave the stage of difficulty and to recover, after years, the most sign in jobs. This is a subject, of course, which occupies the concerns and hearts of Italians, according to all the surveys, in a way far superior to any other, as it is natural, just, proper and understandable. But then, on June 24 last year, 59,600 citizens had landed on the Italian coast. Today the number is substantially similar, slightly higher: 61,400 citizens. Today, however, there is a profound novelty. This theme is the theme of the opening, for days and weeks, of all the initiatives of a communicative nature that are in place and is, at last, a priority on the European political agenda. It\'s about understanding how we want to deal with it. There are two avenues: the first is that of political confrontation. Maybe. It is on talk shows. It is so in the daily debate when election campaigns are taking place. It is at the moment of the confrontation, even ideological and philosophical, which can, of course, enrich our debate. It\'s a guess. We can choose to stay in the permanent election campaign, or to address this problem in a structured, solid and institutional way, as a great country does. I\'d like to be clear. No one lacks the opportunity to play against the past because, if there is a principle on which the political class can afford the luxury of fighting from morning to evening, it is precisely that of turning the past on others. It\'s easy here too. It is easy to go back up the chunks of the agreements, starting with the Dublin agreements. It is also easy here, going up the slope of discussions on the past and on the fact that for years it has weakened the main instrument of international cooperation and relationship with the countries of Africa. It is easy to do so even in reverse parts, because of course everyone can play their cards in a clash that is of a strictly party nature. If you go this way, it is implicitly said that the theme is not an emergency, because it is claimed that it is so little emergency that it can be exploited in a partisan clash. If you accept the principle that it is an emergency and a problem, then you try to find solutions knowing, and starting from the assumption, that the solutions must be found involving everyone. That is why tomorrow morning, with Minister Alfano, we will meet the Presidents of the Regions and a representation of the mayors. We think that if we really want to tackle this problem in a structured way, it is the Italy system that has the duty to intervene. The principle that the Italian system has the duty to intervene starts from a presupposition. Today the Dublin agreements say one simple thing: those who arrive in Italy and have the right to asylum, that is to say to an international protection linked to the situation of war or tension from which it comes, must be welcomed in the country in which it arrives, in the country of disembarkation. It is a profoundly wrong principle, in my opinion. [[Senator Puglia\'s comments.]] SANTANGELO (M5S). Change it, then! Let\'s change! Mr Renzi, President of the Council of Ministers. Imagine that we can manage principles of this scale without considering that we are talking about a European border is clearly a political mistake. However, we know that when you are inside a community, a consensus is needed to change the rules. And the agreement to the structural modification of the regulation not only does not exist today, but I believe that it will hardly be there tomorrow, for a very simple reason: if there are political forces that invest in the fear of our country, thinking thus to take votes, the same happens also in other European and world countries. For us, with a provincial look, it can be a problem that stops in Ventimiglia or - if you want - at the stations, but the problem of immigration in the global flat world has residence in Calais, Arizona, Texas, Burma, the Strait of Malacca, in our beloved Lebanon - where the number of refugees and refugees is incredible - or in Kurdistan. When one goes to Erbil and sees those refugee camps, made not by hundreds, but by hundreds of thousands of people, he realizes that thinking of giving an answer based on a Facebook post is not wrong, but ridiculous. [[Applause from the PD, AP (NCD-UDC) and Aut (SVP, UV, PATT, UPT) and PSI-MAIE Groups.]] In view of this, then - bearing in mind that then there is a place where we can discuss and argue, which is the confrontation between parties - I want to propose to the Italian Parliament that we take note of an institutional fact: Europe starts from these rules, on which we must be clear. Those entitled to welcome must be welcomed. We call on Europe to take care of and take care of other people with us. It\'s not a numerical problem, because we can\'t do it alone. Italy is not a country of the bullocks, which we can continue to represent abroad and our outside world as ridiculous and grotesque. We are a great country that is even in a position to afford to do it on its own. [[Comments of Senators Airola and Bottici]] It is Europe that cannot afford to do alone or to think that it has a foreign policy entrusted to individual states. [[Applause from the PD, AP (NCD-UDC) and Aut (SVP, UV, PATT, UPT) and PSI-MAIE Groups.]] I could come here and say that the problem is that different choices have been made in the past. No. I call on all political forces to help the Italian Government, which has been voted very positively - in my view - with a motion to the European Parliament a few days ago, when - for example - it was said to move towards a redistribution system. [[Senator Paglini\'s comments.]] The main center-right opposition of this country has chosen to vote in favour, together with the majority parties, both right-wing and left-wing, because it is a right principle - in our opinion - to be able to predict the redistribution of the people who arrive. Similarly, looking in particular at the left of this House, I want to say that we can no longer be afraid - if anything - of concepts such as repatriation. It must be clear that we are culturally proud of the effort we are making to invest in international cooperation, on which for the first time in 27 years there is a law. Thanks to the work of the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs and Finance, in the coming days I will be in Addis Ababa to underline the value of Italian commitment to international cooperation, especially towards Africa. We are proud of the effort we are making on international cooperation with women and men of military forces and volunteering, who are going to save lives, because in the face of a saved life there is no survey that holds [[Applause from the PD Group]] I am proud of the angels of the sea who, on behalf of Italy, save thousands of people. Faced with this, however, we must be clear with ourselves: when we arrive in Italy without a title, the return procedures must be speeded up. Efforts to cooperate and agree with countries must be linked. There are no international cooperation agreements with those who do not accept the possibility of a return procedure. On this subject, perhaps, we have been too shy in the past [[Applause from the PD, AP (NCD-UDC) and Aut (SVP, UV, PATT, UPT) and PSI-MAIE Groups]] , despite a very serious job done by the then Prodi Government, and I would like to remind you that at the time the Minister of the Interior was what then became President Napolitano. That effort was then strategic, but sometimes even in our world there is the idea of repatriation as a concept that is frightening. We must be serious: those who have the right to stay in Italy must remain in Italy; those who have the right to asylum must obtain it, but asylum must be conceived more and more as a European operation, and not only Italian. Of course we will proceed one step at a time, because it is not possible to do it in a tranchant way. But at the same time the left cannot be afraid of concepts such as compliance with the rules, concepts to which we must tenaciously cling in order to avoid the risk of a wave that is questioning the very idea of Europe. My generation believes in European identity, and not only because it has had great masters, but also because it has witnessed symbolic gestures. And for my generation - but I also think for others - the most symbolic gesture does not go back to Adenauer or De Gasperi. It is not a gesture that dates back to 1957 or subsequent years. For my generation, and simply for personal reasons, the symbolic gesture of European identity is November 1989, when the Berlin Wall, which we had studied as the cornerstone of European geography, goes down. [[Senator Puglia\'s comments.]] Today we risk that those 14 years old, the same age I was when the Berlin Wall fell, will see a wall built. It is the physical wall that someone would like to build between Hungary and Serbia. [[Applause from the PD Group and Senator Buemi]] And even more so, Italy needs to insist on European enlargement, particularly in Serbia and Albania, because the organic design of European construction has been left in half. It is not possible to expand only towards the Eastern Partnership and leave Serbia and Albania in the hands of a situation of tension such as that which paradoxically could be created and which, yes, is particularly dangerous even from the point of view of public order, a situation in which two realities, which are not involved in the process of European integration, are left, some ten kilometres away, by sea miles, from our home. Go ask Albania\'s Prime Minister Edi Rama what happens when there was a delay of just six months in the definition of Albania as a Member State: some phenomena of religious fundamentalism, which in that country are still present and strong, painted a Europe in which Christians did not want to welcome others. That is why it is essential to have a little more look to avoid the Europe of walls, and I address all of us who have known the Europe that the walls were knocking down. [[Comments by Senator Giarrusso.]] It is certainly a challenge that we must overcome at the European Council tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, but let me say that it is first and foremost a cultural challenge. In these hours there have been controversy that I do not share, but respect. There was - for example - a controversy, while I was at the G7, about the possibility of a health emergency. There has been talk of a scabies pandemic. Let me be clear on this point: the risk of a pandemic on our planet exists. At that moment, at the G7, we were discussing exactly this. In fact, and we have seen it with ebola, there is a strong international focus on the risk that an outbreak of health problems will explode worldwide. But journalistic reconstructions only lead to virtual reality. In physical reality, the work that we are doing as an international country and that we have done on ebola and that we continue to do by building scenarios of concern tells us that the disease brings it to the airliners, bears the evidence that there is a global reality in this world for which every day we must be careful, at the forefront. And it is no coincidence that Italy has internationally recognized institutions because Italy in the world is not the one that has the problem of scabies. It was a hundred years ago when we were taking the scabies to the United States. Italy is that of Spallanzani, of our nurses, of our doctors, of our recognized world leadership on these issues, to which we should all say thanks together, rather than continue to play on the theme of fears. [[Applause from the PD and AP groups (NCD-UDC) and Senator Buemi]] That\'s where the challenge is. Is the European Council to be won? Yes, I propose that you address the European Council as a country system because I believe that this is a value for Italy. However, I also propose - and I say this in particular to the political forces - to face the second battle, which is the cultural battle because today we are living a time in which fear seems to have put solid roots everywhere. It is an economic, cultural fear, linked to the theme of the different, of the other, of the one who seems to come to take away your own identity. Defending identity is a great civil and cultural value, but defending one\'s identity means making a cultural bet about what we have been, about what we are and want to be. We can spend time retorting the past, but I think it will be useful, after this European Council, to try, starting from the outskirts of discontent, to try to build more and more pieces of the future. [[Senator Santangelo\'s comments.]] This can also be done in opposition, but when you go to Europe, you do it by representing a solid country, supportive and capable of saving human lives and able to respect the rules even more than we have ever done. [[Applause from the PD, AP (NCD-UDC and Aut (SVP, UV, PATT, UPT) - PSI-MAIE groups.]]']","<|system|>

The oil price has halved more than half since last autumn. The availability is increasing. We need to deal with a record influx of refugees and migrants. The security policy situation in Europe has changed considerably since the spring of last year. We see attacks and threats from groups that will split, spread hatred and fear rather than progress. The international landscape is constantly changing — economically, safely and in terms of the migration challenge. All of this has consequences for us in Norway. The backbone of the next year’s budget has been demanding because the uncertainties have been numerous. I am pleased today that we now have an agreement on a budget – a budget that I believe will make us well equipped for the challenges next year. I am also pleased that the Stortinget has reached an agreement on how to deal with the asylum situation and the necessary sanctions are being taken, and the government promises to come back quickly in many of these areas. It is a good Norwegian political tradition that we gather on broad and constructive solutions in difficult times, which I feel confident that will also be the case in the years to come. There will always be room for political debate and disagreement in the areas of which we have traditionally disagreed, but I would like to say that I think it is good that in important areas that challenge us and are difficult for our entire society – as the great influx of refugees – a majority on the Grand Duchy has shown that one can find a way forward. The budget adopted today by the Stortinget is a good response to the challenges facing Norway in the future. It provides a basis for work and activity next year, but also a good basis for the long-term transition that Norway needs to undergo. It continues to work on improving health services and increases the provision of treatment. It strengthens the education system. It gives more help to many of our most vulnerable. It reinforces the work we are doing for the green shift, so that we can also achieve our climate targets. Losing the job, or standing out from work, is painful for it. It's not building for society either. For work, the basis for our welfare society – yes, it is people’s efforts and competences that are the basis for the well-being we have today. The workplace is also the place where each individual has the most opportunities and ideas, and it is a social anchor in everyday life. Therefore, the government takes seriously the uncertainty of many individuals and families at a time of increasing unemployment. We don't have any relationships. We can't afford the oil price. The situation in the petroleum industry has led to thinner order books, declining investments and consequences for many of the companies and those working in the industry. Companies have had to cut costs, both in the form of a smaller staff and new ways of working. Many suggest that this development is not necessarily over. We will be in a transition in the oil and gas industries in the years to come. The oil is going to be important for the Norwegian economy for many years, but we have to realize that it is no longer going to be as strong an engine in growth as it has been in the last decades. The petroleum sector has also driven demand in mainland Norway. It has provided jobs with high levels of pay and tax and has created world-leading clusters of innovative enterprises and research environments. It has not least been a major contributor to our living today in one of the world's best welfare societies. So when we experience the change that's happening, we have to adapt and transform. This is why the government has promoted a budget with a main focus on work, activity and long-term change. It contributes to growth in employment and to countering unemployment from lower activity in the oil industry. What we have to do in the long-term transformation is to create the new jobs to fund the welfare of our children and our old age. Finding jobs that provide equal pay — and thus equal tax revenues — to the oil industry or the supplier industry will be a key challenge in the future. There are many ideas about new subsidy schemes to create jobs, but now we don't need jobs that need subsidies. We need jobs that provide tax revenue for the welfare of the future. We cannot be the cheapest and should not have it as a motive here in Norway. We have to do even more to get smarter and to compete among the smartest in the world. The jobs we need in the future must be based on knowledge and technology at the top of the world. In particular, it is important to promote jobs in the private, competitive, tax-free sector, in order to finance the welfare of the future. In the autumn, due to the asylum situation, the additional number has also received considerable attention. To find $9.5 billion. kr without having a bearing on other budget lines is not possible and the level of ambition in any other area has had to be reduced. It is not desirable, but absolutely necessary in today's situation. Nevertheless, I believe that we were able to keep the main direction, both in our government budget and in the agreement that was made on the Stortinget. We give priority to work, activity and change. One of the key instruments for short-term employment is the action package for increased employment. It is clearly targeted at the most affected occupational groups and at the South-West where unemployment has increased most. The action package will help to dampen unemployment growth while the long-term transition to create new jobs is ongoing. We have chosen measures that can have a rapid impact and that can also easily be stepped down again later – because it is important not to raise public expenditure permanently. At the same time, it is essential not to lose sight of the long-term shift. That is why we have also given strong priority to research and innovation. The budgetary authority is strengthening its efforts in the field of knowledge by around 450 million. kr. Innovation, industrial research and seed funds are strengthened by about 250 million. kr. In addition, the budget contributes to growth-enhancing tax relief. At the same time, we have maintained a great commitment to transport. Building infrastructure to continue to reduce the maintenance system that we have, it strengthens the competitiveness of the Norwegian economy, it improves the logistics of business, it secures the journey for families, and it creates more activity and jobs — also in the short term. Therefore, it is important to do more about those things that contribute to activity in the short term and in the long term help to speed up the transition to new jobs. At the same time, we have challenges outside of us. In Paris, the climate summit is underway. The hope of an obligating agreement is still alive. In our budget, we're strengthening the green shift, as we've done since we got into the government offices. The railway effort is increasing sharply following the budgetary conciliation. The same applies to pedestrian and cycle routes. Municipalities that cut emissions will get even more for it. The reward scheme for public transport is increasing strongly and monthly and annual tickets for train journeys are becoming cheaper. We make it easier to make climate-friendly choices in everyday life. But it's important not only to see the challenges that we have, but also the points of light. We have a challenging situation in the oil industry, but other industries in Norway are also doing well. Let me take some time to talk about one of them, the seafood industry. We export 37 million seafood meals daily to about 140 countries around the world. We are at an export record in 2015. Only in October we exported seafood for $8 billion. kr — more than ever. The government's work on the bioeconomy strategy, increased investment in marine research, regulatory simplification and the opening up of new farming technologies will help raise the industry in the coming years. The potential for increased exports of seafood is high. Similarly, the potential for increased exports of skills and technology is high. This has at least two dimensions. We are strengthening the competitiveness of Norwegian companies, and we are contributing with technology that can increase global food production. It must largely come from the sea. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, we need to increase food production by 60 pst. by 2050. So today is less than 2 pst. by food globally from the sea. To satisfy the 9.7 billion people that we will be in 2050, the sea will have to make a decisive contribution. We have knowledge of harvesting and growing the seas sustainably in Norway. There is a significant potential here for our country. So Norway has more legs to stand on, but we need even more power to do it. Norway is not in crisis. After all, in several regions, unemployment has been declining in the last year, including in northern Norway. The draft budget was well received in the trade unions when it was presented. In fact, a number of economists believe – as opposed to parts of the debate I have heard today – that the use of oil money in 2016 is correct because of the cyclical situation we are in. Professor Steinar Ström writes in the Official Journal of Bergen on 9 October that the budget has «soul» – I have not heard it before – and that the increased use of oil money is necessary as a result of the weaker economic growth and increasing unemployment. More experts Today's Business spoke to when the budget was presented, a similar judgment was passed. Monetary and financial policies are designed to stimulate the Norwegian economy in a low economic cycle. A greater budgetary impulse than normal is desirable because we have had a deterioration in the Norwegian economy. According to the OECD, both interest and budgetary policies are well adapted to the current situation in the Norwegian economy. So that's the judgment when we showed up, and that's the same budget impulse that we've still kept. It is therefore well adapted to economic developments. High employment and low unemployment are important objectives for us, but we also need to take care of some of our social objectives. We're going to take care of those who lose their jobs, those who struggle to get into the labour market, those who have holes in the CV, and those who don't feel there's room for them in society. We also know that there are many children who grow up without the safe surroundings and the opportunities children most enjoy. In healthcare, we have cut waiting times for help and introduced free treatment options, but there are still too many who wait unnecessarily long. Security of assistance and care when needed is a pillar of our welfare society. It is the responsibility of the public to ensure good health and care services to all when the need arises. This government continues to give priority to those groups that have not previously experienced being met by the welfare community as they should have been. The effort in the field of drugs and mental health is to be continued, which is also clearly reflected in the escalation plan in the drug field that has been presented a few weeks ago. The system of free core time in kindergartens is now being extended to three-year-olds. Health stations and school health services are being strengthened. Municipal Child Protection shall be given a lift. The investigation of violence and child abuse is strengthened. We're increasing pensions, both to minimum pensioners and to married pensioners, and we're closing holes in the social security network when we're betting so strongly on better care in the future. Public can do a lot, but it can't do everything. That's why we're also continuing to work on volunteering for the future. I am pleased that we have received a budget, but I am most pleased that we have got a very good budget – a budget that helps to stimulate the strengths of the Norwegian economy, and that helps us step up our efforts on infrastructure, research, education and innovation. In fact, I am not in doubt: although there are major challenges ahead of us, Norway also has the best conditions for success."", ""The Paris Climate Summit concluded with joy and relief that nearly 200 of the world’s countries were able to come together on an ambitious agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement provides the basis for avoiding extensive and dangerous climate change and enables us to start a global transition to the low- and zero-emission society. Our recently resigned climate and environment minister Tine Sundtoft and the entire Norwegian negotiating team left a solid imprint on the new agreement and contributed significantly in the negotiations. Norway’s central role in the negotiations shows that we have high credibility in climate policy. The combination of ambitious commitments to the national cut and a strong international contribution enable Norway to go with raised its head out of the climate summit and be proud of our contribution. Norway has a good starting point for meeting the objectives of the new climate agreement. Our goal to cut 40 pst. of our emissions by 2030 are also ambitious in the framework of the Paris Agreement. The government and the cooperation parties agree on the broad lines of climate policy, and together we have strengthened the climate agreement. We have to deal with big cuts in greenhouse gas emissions here at home. The government has therefore pointed to five areas of activity in which Norway has special advantages and prerequisites for leading development. These are low-emission solutions in industry, green shipping, carbon capture and storage, renewable energy and transport. The government's proposals for the state budget build up in these areas of activity, and we have further strengthened it through constructive negotiations with our cooperation parties that led to a budget agreement that has a clear green mark. Norway has shown that it is possible to decoupling economic growth from increased emissions, which will be absolutely global if we succeed in achieving the ambitions we have set ourselves in Paris. In Norway, this has not happened by chance; it is due to fantastic natural assumptions, mainly our watercourses, but also offensive policies. Norway may have the best support schemes in the world for the development of climate and environmental technologies, and we have only become more ambitious over the years. ‘Nordic shows that it is possible’ said the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, at an event during the climate summit. The Government and the Cooperation Parties therefore continue to strengthen the Climate, Renewable Energy and Energy Conversion Fund, in order to increase Enova’s economic space for action. This allows, for example: bets such as Hydro Karmøy’s new pilot plant, a facility that will enable the production of the world’s cleanest aluminium. Norway is a renewable country. The continued deployment of renewable energy will be essential for achieving the ambitious climate objectives. But if our renewable power is to be guaranteed a price that makes it profitable to expand, we need to make more use of the power here at home. These include: to facilitate more powerful process industries in Norway and for new industries, such as green data centres. The combination of natural assumptions, such as clean renewable energy, the world’s best climate technology support schemes and workers with high skills, makes Norwegian industry have all the prerequisites for growth. Such developments will be good news not only for jobs and value creation at home but also for the global greenhouse gas accounts. Industry is known as part of the EU ETS, which means that total emissions in this sector will decrease over time. This is good for Norway, and it is good for the climate. Norway has proud maritime traditions, and it is natural that we use our competence to create new low- and zero-emission technologies in shipping. It is not by chance that the world's first, and so far only, electric passenger and car ferries operate in Sognefjord in Norway. The «Ampere» river is proof that the market delivers when requirements are made in combination with good support schemes. «Amps» are partly financed by the eco-innovation scheme under Innovation Norway. Together with the cooperation parties, the government has strengthened the scheme with a total of 145.5 million. kr. We will also strengthen our efforts through other instruments and have given Enova clearer tasks in the shipping and transport sectors. In addition, in order to make it more attractive to bet on electrically operated vessels, the government and the cooperation parties have reduced the electricity charge for all ships in commercial traffic. The Government's proposals for a government budget reinforce the Green Shipping Programme under the Ministry of Industry and Trade and will contribute to more innovation and development. Innovation and new technologies are also important for the established industries. Unlike what more representatives will claim in this debate today, the Paris Agreement does not mean the end of the oil industry in Norway. As part of the quota sector and with the world's most stringent requirements for health, environment and safety, Norway will continue to be a stable supplier in a world that demands more and more energy. Both the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Energy Agency agree that fossil energy sources will be part of the world’s energy supply for many decades to come, and that it is therefore important to focus on developing technologies for the capture and storage of CO2. The Government’s CO2 management strategy is based on a range of activities to develop gas capture, storage and transport technologies. The 2016 State budget will increase the funding for the CLIMIT research programme by 30 million. kr, and there are fresh funds to invest in the testing centre of Mongstad. It is the ambition of the climate agreement for a full-scale CCS plant that underpins the government's investment, and therefore, next year, we will also spend about 65 million. kr for this work. Potential studies are now being carried out on three alternative point emissions to test the full scale in Norway, as well as to seek international cooperation in the EU. Now I've spent a lot of time talking about what we're going to do here at home, but the fight against climate change and cutting emissions is not a Norwegian championship. Norway’s international efforts to combat deforestation and to conserve the world’s rain and rainforests are significant. During the climate summit, Minister of Climate and Environment Tine Sundtoft announced that Norway would continue the climate and forest activity by 2030. Climate and forest activities are noticed internationally, and they can show very good results. I am pleased that, together with our cooperation parties, we have further strengthened this important work in the budgetary agreement. Climate and forest spending, the contribution to the UN Green Fund and our efforts to develop renewable energy in developing countries make Norway an international superpower in climate aid. We are about to leave behind a year that has not only been challenging, but partly very difficult and heavy for the Norwegian petroleum industry, and unfortunately there is nothing to suggest that 2016 will be easier. The situation we're in now shows us seriously how oil addicts we've become. For many years, the right warned against the strong two-way division of the Norwegian economy. When the oil price and activity drop dramatically, we pay the price because we didn't start the conversion earlier. Conversion is not something the government has begun to talk about because the oil price fell, but the fall in the oil price makes the need for conversion more acute, and the conversion must therefore take place faster than thought. In the debate on conversion and creating more legs to stand on, we must not fall into the trap of believing that this can only be achieved by cutting off our most important leg, namely the oil industry. The Norwegian oil and gas industry is our most important industry, and it will remain so for many years to come. But right now it's not the strongest engine for growth. The industry is cyclical in nature, but I would warn those who are now celebrating the low oil price and proclaim that this is the beginning of the end of the Norwegian petroleum industry. Firstly, low oil prices are perhaps one of the worst enemies of the climate, and secondly, there will be a need for oil and gas in the energy mix of the future, including what we find in the Paris agreement. However, low oil prices undermine renewable efforts and hinder conversion. Therefore, we have to hope for the price to come up again, both for the industry and for the climate. And then we have to stop focusing on green solutions on continuing oil business. We are not better equipped to carry out the green shift by weakening our main source of income. The Norwegian oil and gas industry is most closely involved in global climate change. The industry is part of the EU ETS, which means that, in cooperation with the rest of the EU ETS, it will cut 43 pst. of its emissions by 2030. In addition, the Norwegian industry is subject to the world’s highest CO2 tax. It thus has strong incentives to hunt for emission reductions, which it also does. As the quota market is tightened in line with the EU climate objectives and the new Paris Agreement, climate requirements for oil and gas activities and other fossil fuels will be even tougher. The Norwegian industry is well equipped to meet these requirements. It is very gratifying that we have set up an ambitious international climate agreement. The problem so far has not been that Norway, and the EU, have not done enough. On the contrary, we've run ahead, and now the rest of the world is reporting. Overall, this agreement can give the Norwegian petroleum industry a competitive advantage by already being used to climate change requirements and living well with them. The global fossil industry will get tougher, and profitability will be challenged. As the targets are tightened, this will also apply to the Norwegian petroleum industry. But what oil and gas must remain in the ground is the seventh and last market and the profitability of each project that will determine. It has been important for governments and cooperation parties to provide a budget of good action packages with exceptional measures to reduce unemployment and keep pace with the Norwegian economy. The government cannot do anything about the oil price, nor can it do anything about the lack of mission and low activity. But we can facilitate conditions through stable framework conditions and new search areas. 23rd concession round must proceed as planned. At the same time, we must continue to invest in research and development in industry, and I am pleased that the government has strengthened petroleum-oriented development and demonstration through the DEMO 2000 programme. This will contribute to increased activity and employment. Extensive industry work is now under way to cut costs, increase efficiency and improve competitiveness. They're about to succeed in this. In one year they have cut costs of between 30 and 40 pst. All the new contract awards for the Johan Sverdrup project also show that the industry is in the process of becoming more competitive. I am happy to see the will and ability of the industry to meet difficult times in a good way, but the industry must become more robust in meeting the fluctuating and lower oil price than it has been accustomed to. I will end by thanking the opposition for constructive cooperation in the Committee's work on the State Budget, and I look forward to the debate."", ""This state budget has existed at a time when the economic outlook is different from what we have been accustomed to for the last 10–15 years. Since last year, the fall in oil investment has reinforced a trend that was already under way. Many now lose their jobs in the industries and parts of the country most affected by the fall in oil prices. It is bad for those affected – individuals, families and small and large businesses. The fall in the oil price is a reminder that the Norwegian economy is going through a transformation – what we have today is changing. For Norway, this means that the oil no longer becomes the same engine of growth in the economy. For workers and businesses, it may be necessary to convert to new activities. The government therefore provides a budget for work, activity and conversion. Faced with a demanding shift in the economy, the most important thing we can do now is to stimulate growth in private, competitive business. That is why we are putting forward a tax reform with lower taxes on what we want more – investment and growth in business and jobs. That is why we continue the efforts of the times in the field of transport – it strengthens growth. Therefore, we focus on knowledge, research and development – our main resource, the labour force, should become even more skilled. At the same time, we are presenting a package of measures for increased employment. We are correcting the efforts in the areas that have been hit most by the fall in the oil price. We are strengthening efforts for the unemployed. And we strengthen the social security network – for addicts, for children growing up in poor families, for adults at risk of falling out of work. The state budget for 2016 responds to today's challenges and equips us for the future. When we found the first oil resources in the North Sea 50 years ago, political Norway joined the business community and laid the foundation for a world-leading oil and gas industry and secured large revenues for the country. When we found the oil, we showed off. We as society and individuals have experienced the value of the wise choices our parents and grandparents made 50 years ago. On 17 August 1965, the first concession round was announced. This year, the government announced a 23rd concession round. It will be an important contribution for our children and grandchildren to experience the value of the oil adventure for many decades to come. But we have to plan for a future where the demand from the oil industry will be lower. We need to facilitate the growth of other industries in Norway, creating new values and more jobs. Making changes is demanding. Now we have to make the right choices, so that we can facilitate growth in value creation and well-being for the next 50 years. It is the founder of the West, the small-scale farm manager in Hedmark, the fisherman in the north and the labour effort of ordinary people throughout the country that will continue to develop. It's our job as politicians to facilitate that. Everyone agrees that working for everyone is an important goal. But this goal is not enough to keep people at work. The crucial thing is that we fulfil the goal of working for everyone with content, that we facilitate the creation of businesses, values can grow, and people can get work. Behind every job that is created, there have been some who have believed in their idea and the ability to put the idea into life. When we're going to continue our development, we have to do it on the basis that it has to be easier to succeed in creating jobs. Then we build better opportunities for people to be innovative and to cope with the changes we encounter. The government's 2016 government budget is doing just that. We invest in the people's knowledge. We invest in business start-ups, in the ability to create new jobs and secure jobs. We invest in the opportunities to participate in the labour market – through a good health system, good roads and collective solutions and a safe social security network that gives us help when we need it. Norway is a good country to live in. We have a highly educated population and are rich in natural resources that provide opportunities for a few other countries are miserable. We have a good foundation. But now we meet challenging times. Money policy is our first line defense when it goes against it. Lower crowns and lower wage increases are a clear advantage for export companies, suppliers of oil and other companies facing competition from abroad. It contributes to the necessary transformation of the economy. However, the level of costs will be clearly higher than the average of our trading partners. At the same time, the growth in productivity – what we get left for every hour of work we lay down – has fallen back since the middle of last decade. Low interest rates and other monetary policy measures, both at home and abroad, support under economic activity. In Norway, a low level of interest rates contributes to the growth of household demand for goods and services. More people in the country have got a job. The number of persons employed has increased by more than 20 000 in the last year. At the same time, the number of unemployed persons has increased. Unemployment has increased mainly in the counties of the South and West, which have a strong connection with the oil industry. The availability is lower or unchanged in the majority of the other counties. Unemployment has increased most among young people. It seems to have become more difficult for young people to enter the labour market next to school and at the end of their education. Overall, the government is laying the foundations for a relatively weak growth in the Norwegian economy this year, somewhat better next year and a growth against trend in 2017. Economic policy is an important reason why growth is estimated to rise. Unemployment is expected to rise slightly from today's level. The estimates are uncertain. The fall in oil prices since last summer shows that the outlook for the Norwegian economy can change rapidly. In particular, economic developments in China are uncertain. A setback in China and other emerging economies can reduce oil prices even more and cause concern in financial markets, as we saw in the late summer. The rise in the euro area is fragile. At home, it is uncertain how much demand from the petroleum industry will react to lower oil prices and how it will turn out in the Norwegian economy and in the labour market. Developments also depend on how enterprises and households react to the outlook for a weaker economic development and how competitiveness develops in the future. For 2015, the government raised an oil money use that contributes to the demand of the mainland economy from last year to this year of 0.5 pst. The budget was thus more expansive than it has been in the past 10–15 years. Some people then criticized the government for spending too much oil money, but the result is that we have had a budget well adapted to the economic situation, which has given us greater security for employment and growth than if we had used less. Fortunately, the government was out early. Also for next year, the government will set up fiscal policies so that the Norwegian economy is best prepared for lower activity in the oil industry and uncertain economic times. It is a particular challenge that many now lose their jobs in the industries and counties most affected by the low oil price. The government will therefore take the necessary steps in the budget to strengthen its efforts for work and activity. Fiscal efforts are reinforced by specific measures for increased employment of 4 billion. kr, with a focus on areas that are particularly hard hit by the setback. We have planned major investments in the modernisation of Norwegian society over the coming years. We're reinforcing a number of these bets: on more modern, efficient and environmentally friendly transport in better schools and universities of innovation, entrepreneurship, knowledge and research We will speed up the economy here and now and at the same time contribute to a more growth-intensive economy that can provide better well-being, environment and secure jobs in the future. Overall, the government’s draft budget will contribute to the demand of the mainland economy from this year to the next year of 0.7 pst. Oil money consumption in 2016 will be equivalent to 194 billion. NOK or almost NOK 37 000 per capita. Economic policy, as a whole, means a vigorous effort over a demanding period of time. This is true in today’s economic situation, both to support the short-term activity and to contribute to change and innovation. And we are aware that the increased use of oil money should also lead to lower taxes and taxes. There are two main reasons for this: A lower level of taxation and a tax system that promotes better resource use are the main measures to promote business conversion, value creation and jobs. Increased employment in the public sector cannot be the main response to the challenges facing the Norwegian economy at present. What is required is to facilitate growth in business. It is absolutely vital to our prosperity. Nearly two million people work in business throughout the country – in small and large enterprises. Such jobs do not come of their own. A good tax system is important for employment, value creation and well-being. A better tax system can increase the number of jobs and make the economy more productive. When individuals can decide more about their own income, it stimulates more people to work. And when we lower taxes on business, it becomes more advantageous to invest, invest and create jobs in Norway. It is the value of our work that finances the Norwegian welfare community. What we create from values gives us new welfare arrangements. Therefore, welfare can never be set up against value creation — one presupposes the other. The government has now reduced taxes and taxes by over 13 billion. kr. Both ordinary people and business have been relieved. In the budget, the government is proposing new, significant reliefs that can contribute to investment, growth and jobs. We're proposing new reliefs in taxes and taxes of a total of $9.1 billion. kr. The biggest and most important tax relief is to reduce the corporate tax rate from 27 to 25 p.m. and to do the same with the income tax for persons. There is an important change in order to reduce the risk of companies moving taxable profits out of Norway and to ensure future investment in Norway. When we lower the corporate tax, we make it more profitable to invest in Norway, and we strengthen the competitiveness of Norwegian business. The government's proposal for tax treatment is the first step in a major reform of the tax system, which we present at the same time with this budget. The aim of the tax reform is to make our economy growthier. Therefore, it is worth investing in Norwegian jobs. And it's going to pay off to work, because work and activity are the very basis for our common well-being. Such a tax policy will also have good dynamic effects and give rise to higher economic growth. In view of the economic challenges now facing the country, with falls in oil industry demand, 2016 is a good and proper time to launch the follow-up to the Tax Committee. When the government presents the tax communication at the same time as the 2016 budget, the Stortinget will be able to see the 2016 proposals in a broader context. We want to facilitate a broad settlement on the tax changes. It will contribute to predictability and stability. It can promote economic growth. The current economic situation gives additional arguments to reduce the level of taxation. High taxes impose burdens on business and make conversion more difficult. Like the Tax Committee, the Government proposes that lower taxes on general income be partly financed by a new gross tax on personal income. The government is proposing the creation of a new step tax that replaces today's top tax. The threshold tax shall ensure a good distribution of the tax burden. Persons with high incomes shall pay more in taxes than those with low incomes. It is unwise to reduce corporate tax without the relief of ordinary people. Therefore, the tier tax is designed to provide relief and the total marginal tax on labour is reduced. It will stimulate increased work. As part of a major tax reform, where tax relief is granted to broad groups, it is natural to go through different deductions and special arrangements in the tax system. At the heart of each job in business is large investment. Norwegian capital and Norwegian owners contribute to the start-up of several new enterprises and to the conversion of established companies. The property tax clearly has a negative and unfortunate effect on private Norwegian ownership because it only affects Norwegian owners. The taxes on wealth may also affect investment among enterprises that rely on Norwegian capital. A founder in Haugesund cannot acquire equity in the international capital market to the same extent as an international group. The small business owner in Haugesund is dependent on local investors. For such enterprises, it may be important how Norwegian owners are taxed. The government therefore proposes to increase the asset tax base to 1.4 million. kr. Reduce the rate to 0,8 pst. At the same time, the valuation discount for commercial property and secondary dwellings is reduced to 20 pst. It will distort investment from real estate to industrial activity. With total tax reliefs of SEK 9.1 billion. In 2016, the tax base will be approximately 22 billion. kr lower than when the government took over. With the government's proposal, about nine out of ten taxpayers get relief or unchanged tax. The average tax relief is NOK 1000. All income groups except those with gross income above 2 million. kr receives tax relief on average. The self-employed comes out well with average relief of NOK 3 400. The sum of our tax arrangements are tax changes that increase the growth of the Norwegian economy, greater opportunities for Norwegian enterprises and security for Norwegian jobs. In order for Norway to continue to be a rich country, we need to lay the foundation for future value creation now. We have to make it possible for businesses and people to come up with the good ideas. Research and development is one of the main sources of innovation and long-term growth. In the next year's budget, the government proposes to increase public funding for research and development to over 32 billion. kr, corresponding to 1,1 pst. GDP. This is the largest research budget ever, both in dollars and as a share of GDP. The government is following up the long-term research and higher education plan. We will create new recruitment positions, invest more in research infrastructure and stimulate Norwegian researchers to participate in the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. A strong commitment to higher education and research is both a prerequisite and an instrument for a more competitive business, green jobs and more world-leading professional environments. We also strengthen the study funding and facilitate the construction of 2,200 new student homes in 2016. As Minister of Finance, I meet a number of firemen who work with all their strength to make their visions a reality. Earlier this year, I met the owner of SalMar ASA, who is staying at Frøya. It was an inspiring meeting. SalMar is a company that has taken knowledge from Norwegian offshore technology at sea to fish farming in the Pacific Ocean area outside the South Seas. Here, the best is combined from two of our main export industries and creates opportunities for new growth. This is an example of how the petroleum industry is a source of ideas and innovations and how technology from the oil industry can be used for new industries and new jobs. The point is, we don't yet know how knowledge from part of the economy can be used in other contexts. We therefore need a strong commitment to research and development and, above all, to commercialisation of research. TaxFUNN shall trigger socio-economical profitable research and development. The Government will strengthen the scheme by raising the amount limit for the deduction of own-executed and purchased research and development. In the context of the State budget, the government is also presenting the Founding Plan to create and strengthen a culture of entrepreneurial activity in Norway, and we are proposing to increase the budget by 400 million. kr to various founding measures. In total, the government’s research effort – investing in maritime value creation along the coast, founders throughout the country and world-leading educational institutions – is a powerful contribution both to migration, growth in existing industries, and as a basis for new jobs. Well-developed road networks and efficient public transport are essential for all of us everyday whether we are going to deliver in kindergarten, go to football training or transport fish in car combinations from More to Gardermoen. Better infrastructure is one of the main initiatives of the Right Party Government. An efficient and modern infrastructure provides the basis for increased value creation and strengthens the growth capacity of the Norwegian economy. Effective solutions for public transport make everyday life easier for people most, and less central areas can become good residential areas to reduce the pressure on the housing market. Next year's transport budget is a strong boost to build the country. The government proposes a real increase of 3.8 billion. kr from 2015 until the follow-up of the national transport plan. Even without further escalation, the framework for the first four-year period of the transport plan will be overfilled. The total increase in road use appropriations by 18.5 pst. This facilitates too high activity in road development. Increased maintenance and bets on the walk and cycle path are other bets. Transport is also about local roads, maintenance, rail and public transport. People like to be just as concerned with dangerous junctions in the neighborhood as getting two-field highways out of town. Therefore, the county roads are given a significant lift. We do that both through increased transfers to county councils and through interest compensation for a new investment framework of 3 billion. kr. This will contribute to better maintenance and increased renewal of the county roads. After many decades of increasing maintenance kits, the government has reduced the backlog in 2015. A strong commitment to maintenance and renewal in the State budget will lead to a further decline in the follow-up in 2016. The government continues its record-breaking efforts on the railway. The appropriations for the Railway Agency are about 50 pst. higher than before the government change in 2013. Special maintenance effort has increased. There will be good progress on all railway projects under way. There will be further planning and development of the intercity sections. We'll start planning the Ringerix track, which when it's done will bring Oslo and Bergen one hour closer to each other. And the NSB can invest in new train sets – in the East, Gjøvikbanen and Vossebanen. This shall improve punctuality and comfort in train traffic and facilitate increased capacity in the longer term. The job of taking the maintenance session is continuing. Railway maintenance is increasing by more than 30 pst. in 2016. At the same time, we need changes in the railway organisation. The Government will therefore carry out a reform of the rail sector. The railway works and the NSB shall be restructured and there shall be increased competition for passenger train services. The goal is a better everyday life for travelers and carriers. Before the summer, the government put forward proposals to set up a road development company. It shall plan, build, operate and maintain some long road sections in a holistic and coherent manner. Until now, roads in Norway have been largely planned and built piece by piece and split. The development company will be able to see the development projects continuously and completely. The government's proposal involves the company being granted 1.3 billion. SEK in direct appropriations and operating credits in 2016. Increased socio-economic profitability is an important objective of the ongoing reforms in the sector. We have established a dedicated infrastructure fund that provides more predictable financing for transport infrastructure. We said that the fund should be filled up to 100 billion. kr during the government period. With this budget, we are already reaching that target in 2016. This government has shown that it really is on the road. It should have been done a long time ago. Now it's happening! It is the employees of the welfare services of the municipalities that are the first line in the Norwegian welfare society. It is those who receive the children in the kindergarten in the morning, give homework and meet for parents’ conversations, and go on home visits to elderly nurses. They're our everyday heroes. It is also the staff who assist many of the most vulnerable in society. In order to strengthen well-being, priority must be given to these positions. It happens by strengthening the local economy. In the 2016 budget, the government provides a stronger municipal structure than announced in the municipal bill. We're adding up to a real growth in the total income of the local government sector of 7.3 billion. kr. Well over half of this is free income. This enables municipalities to strengthen services that are most important in people's everyday lives – kindergartens, schools and care services. Nothing is more important to people's opportunities in life than education. The nursery shall be the first meeting of the child with the knowledge society. Children should learn to play, create friendship, stimulate curiosity, language and build social skills. Therefore, one of the government's most important promises to children, parents and employees is that the quality of kindergartens should be improved. We're strengthening the quality of babysitting in kindergartens by 160 million. SEK, to a total of 440 million. kr. It's far more than a double in the two years we've been in government. The growth of free income also facilitates more nursery places and thus more flexible admission. The foundation already laid from kindergarten and the first day of school is important for the rest of your life. The smallest children meet proudly and excitedly for the first day of school with great expectations of learning. The government's objective is a education system with knowledge and quality at all stages, adapted to each student. Only in this way will we enable the individual to meet later school and work in a good way. That's why we're betting on even better teachers, more school hours and targeted bets in selected subjects. More than 5000 teachers will be offered further training in 2016. We are proposing to strengthen the real science work. We're betting on high-level students, and measures for better learning for those who are struggling. And we're strengthening our efforts to read and write through continuing education for teachers. By investing in knowledge, we lay the foundation for the business life of the future. What we invest in knowledge, we get back in the future. And the more we teach our children in the formal education system, the more we become able to learn in the workplace, be innovative and cope with the changes we encounter. It's very serious for society, and for the individual, that half of those who start a vocational education never finish. This is why the Right-wing Party Government has launched a series of powerful measures to get more people to choose and complete a profession. Through a professional career, we will train several good professionals for Norwegian business. The apprenticeship grant had remained silent for more than 10 years until the government change, except for a temporary increase in 2009. Under this government, the grant has increased three times in two years, with a total of NOK 10000 per contract. With the government's youth package, the apprentice's grant to the companies increases by a further NOK 2 500 per apprentice. Good health is important in all people's lives. That we get the right treatment – of high quality – when disease threatens, provides security. Much is good in Norwegian healthcare, but we can and should do better. When we pay high taxes, we also have demands for a health care service of the highest quality. It is a heart issue for the government — and we have taken a number of initiatives to ensure patients’ health: in 2013, almost 250,000 were in hospital queues. The queues rose. The government's goal has been to bring down the queues. Rapid treatment is both a good economy and provides security for the individual. So we're proposing close to $2.9 billion. kr in increased hospital appropriations to allow more people to be treated. Even more important than resources are the results for patients. Hospitals provide more treatments today than two years ago. Nearly 18,000 fewer patients are waiting for treatment compared to the same time two years ago. With increased resources and higher growth in hospital activity, even more people can be helped next year. The quality of the treatment of life-threatening diseases must be improved. For example, the cycle of cancer provides greater predictability and safety. If you have cancer, healthy diagnosis and treatment are vital. Nearly eight out of ten cancer patients who are in the cancer package are now receiving treatment within the prescribed time frame. This shows us that a better health care often involves as much better solutions as more money. The goal should always be to save lives. No one should miss out on the family pictures of the future because they didn't get the help they needed at the time of the haste. Before the 2013 elections, we promised to bet on the drug field. We promised to buy more treatment places from private and non-profits. We promised faster treatment and shorter waiting time. It's given results. In the last year, waiting time for specialised drug treatment went down by almost two weeks on average. Two weeks is a long time for a drug addict who is motivated for treatment. But we still have a good piece left. For too long, too many people have fallen outside — people who are struggling with alcohol and with mental disorders. Russ and mental health are therefore only out when we introduce free treatment options. It is high time that this group was given priority first — when we introduced new rights and increased freedom of choice. And we have to get a complete treatment chain all the way into the goal. For many addicts, the hardest job is to deal with different people, different offices, different sectors and different application forms. The help is for the broken up, too incomplete. In the course of the fall, we come up with an escalating plan for the drug field, with the plan following a frame of a total of 2.4 billion. SEK in the period 2016-2020, including: is to be used to strengthen the work of drug users in municipalities. With the plan, we provide a strong boost for treatment, housing, health care, early interventions and aftercare. It's about getting a change for the better for the individual addicts. It's about creating good and whole services. That's why it also means something when we bet in health stations and school health services. We provide 150 more psychologists in the municipalities. This is a significant bet. The aim is for all municipalities to have psychological competence in 2020. We have to start early to prevent disease. We have to start early to prevent school drop-outs. We have to start early to prevent addiction. Psychiatric disorders are a serious public health problem, and it is important to have a good and rapidly available range of services in the municipalities – they need to employ more psychologists. It is an investment for the future – an investment in people with abilities and resources. Health and care services are not just for the treatment of disease. They're just as much to give the opportunity to master, to have a good everyday life and a meaningful life in spite of the fact that old age makes life change. Although most elderly people live active and safe lives, stay healthy and live at home for as long as possible, many will need help at home or the safety of living in a nursing home. I have seen a lot of good in Norwegian care for the elderly. I have met active elderly, competent caregivers and visited beautiful new nursing homes and nursing homes where there is a homely and cosy atmosphere, and everyday life is active and varied. This is what modern care for the elderly is supposed to be. It is that older people are treated as independent people, and that their desires, needs and dignity are cared for – even if you need extra help to master your everyday life. But we know that the quality of care for the elderly varies greatly. In some places, care for the elderly is not good enough, and many people do not feel that they need services at the level they need. That is why we have thought that the State should take greater responsibility for ensuring that the municipalities provide enough and good enough services and legislate the right to the care and care of good luck. In 2014, the Right-Fremskritsparte government strengthened the investment grant for the development of nursing homes and luckily care by allowing the State to take a greater share of the development costs. This has led to a change of pace. Last year, municipalities applied for grants for nearly 2,500 places, and the government's aim is to facilitate the construction of a further 2,500 health homes next year. Next year, we will start work on developing a safety standard in nursing homes. This should be a tool to assist municipalities in ensuring and monitoring quality. The aim is to contribute to real improvement, better recruitment, good professional environment and safety for patients and relatives. In 2016, we also provide an increased daily and activity offer to people with dementia. We propose funds for 1,200 more day-time activities for residents with dementia. We also need to ensure that the care of the elderly has both warm hands and – not least – wise heads. That is why we are committed to strengthening the skills of employees. The government also proposes 700 million. DKK over three years to test new state-funded care for the elderly. In 2016, 20 municipalities will be given the opportunity to participate in the State funding experiment. The aim is to see whether state funding will contribute to increased quality, more equivalent services across the country, and to better address needs. The country's pensioners have been treated unfairly for too long. Married and cohabiting pensioners today cut off their pension by 15 pst. It seems unreasonable that pensioners lose their pension to be married. Now we're reducing the abbreviation with effect from 1 September next year. Then married and cohabiting pensioners get an average increase of their pension of NOK 8 000. A good society is also about taking care of the environment and climate. The government is stepping up the green shift through reduced charges for shipping and support for climate and environmental technologies. We also propose significant capital contributions to the Climate Fund. We have already promised to increase the fund in addition to that resulting from the climate agreement. We are now proposing to increase the appropriation by another 5 billion. kr. After that, the fund will be 67.8 billion. kr, which is 17.8 billion. kr more than the ambition of the climate agreement. Environmental policy is not primarily about budget lines with a green label – it is about effective measures that deliver climate emissions and pollution and that help households and businesses to make environmentally friendly choices. The government has set down a green tax commission. The Commission shall assess whether and how a green tax conversion can contribute to lower greenhouse gas emissions, a better environment and good economic development. The Commission shall submit its advice in December. We want to invest in environmentally friendly infrastructure. The transport sector shall take into account the climate and the environment. We keep investing massively in the railways. And we want to facilitate better collective provision. We also propose increased appropriations for measures for walking and cycling. That is also a good climate policy. In 2016, we propose that the scheme of grants for investment in private dwellings be linked to the tax system. Household owners should therefore be able to choose to receive the benefit as a tax deduction in tax settlement as an alternative to direct aid from Enova. There is no doubt that climate change affects us. But the climate challenge is global and best solved globally. It's important how we can prevent it. Norway contributes significantly to international climate action. We're continuing the ambitious climate and forest effort by 3 billion. kr. We also grant 270 million. kr for the purchase of UN-approved climate allowances. The government is also working to ensure that negotiations under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change lead to a climate agreement in line with the 2°C target. As part of such an agreement, Norway will undertake an ambitious emission reduction commitment. We are in dialogue with the EU to conclude a joint fulfilment agreement. The government wants a secure society – young and old, night and day – where we are clear and consistent in the fight against crime. Visible and present police and good preparedness are important for the security of society. We have already created hundreds of new police posts. The goal is to get more policemen out in the streets. The close police reform will be implemented from 1 January 2016. This is the biggest change in Norwegian police since the millennium. At the same time, police staff are increasing and the renewal of the ICT systems of the police is escalating. This will make the police better able to prevent, investigate and prosecute criminal acts, while at the same time increasing the proximity of the police and ensuring more visible police where people live. At the same time, when the police are provided with increased resources and become more effective, their capacity for settlement must be sufficient. For too long, the criminal justice chain has been down-prioritised, and the settlement queues have increased. In September, Norway was used in prisons in the Netherlands. The prison has 242 seats. It is an important step towards removing the pay queue, and renting out prisons in the Netherlands continues until next year. At the same time, we will establish 181 places at the Eidsberg prisons and at Ullersmo. The government strengthens the preparedness sector to help the country to be better equipped to deal with future crises. In 2016, we are committed to increasing the capacity of the population's social security work, and we are launching the pre-projecting of a centre for national response capacities. The heightened threat to Norway and our allies requires more of the police security service. The government is proposing a total of 145 million. SEK to, among others additional police security service premises. These are challenging times in the world. The war in Syria is marked by brutal behaviour on several sides of the conflict. The conflict has created one of the greatest refugee crises of our time. It is a major and fundamental challenge that politicians must take seriously. According to the United Nations, over 4 million Syrians have fled the country since the summer of 2012. Most of these are in the neighbourhoods. International society needs to increase efforts for refugees and civilians in need in Syria and neighbouring countries. The government will step up humanitarian aid and emergency aid efforts. The proposed 2016 humanitarian budget of more than 4.3 billion. kr is exceptional in Norwegian history, with an increase of 1 billion. kr, or close to 30 pst. One and a half billion. kr will be earmarked for Syria, Iraq and neighbouring countries. This is where the Norwegian effort can help most. Norway is with it one of the greatest humanitarian donors. Norway has always faced humanitarian disasters. But we have to get more countries to give us more. That is why we have taken the initiative of a donor country conference to put in place more international support. Food, medicine, clean water and shelter are needed quickly. In the last few months, we've seen that a lot of people move on from the neighbourhoods. A well-functioning foreign administration is becoming even more important now as Norway, like the rest of Europe, is experiencing increased influxes of refugees and asylum seekers. Therefore, the government proposes to increase the capacity of the Foreign Affairs Directorate. In a situation of increased asylum arrivals, it is important that the Norwegian authorities clarify the identity and history of those who come to the country at the earliest opportunity, including: to prevent illegal immigration and to combat cross-border crime. At the same time, the return work must continue. Persons without legal residence in Norway shall leave the country quickly. There is great uncertainty about the development we are in and how many asylum seekers will come to Norway. The influx of asylum seekers has increased significantly since August this year and has been greater than that foreseen in the 2016 State budget. The Government will provide an additional number to the budget, based on updated estimates of asylum arrivals. The task of receiving, settling and integrating will be a challenge for the foreign administration, and municipalities must do the task of integrating those who come to the country. Norway shall take its part in the responsibility. But we're a small country and we can't handle tasks we can't handle. Already there are cows in the asylum system. Thousands of flights are still waiting to be settled in a Norwegian municipality. Over time, it is essential for those who are allowed to stay to have a home, learn Norwegian and gain access to the labour market. Norwegian companies meet tougher times. This has been noticed by many individuals: some have lost their job, others have felt insecure about it. And some jobseekers have not got a job. In the last year, the fall in the oil price has made the need for conversion faster than we could hope. So today, the government is promoting a proposal for a government budget with a clear objective: we give priority to creating the strong framework that enables jobs to be created, that people have a job to go to, and we solve challenges that most people face in everyday life. We're betting on what gives people security and a simpler everyday life. We're cutting the waiting times in the health care system. We're expanding care with new places, while raising quality. We're raising the stakes for addicted and poor children. We are strengthening the local economy. We secure Norway through more policemen in the streets and new prisons. We are transforming and reforming. This is absolutely necessary in order to ensure the welfare of tomorrow. We strengthen and further develop Norwegian society by investing in our most important resource: the people who live in the country. This is how we build the welfare of the future, based on a strong and competitive business, and a country with opportunities for everyone – not by fear of reform, not by putting a bond on freedom and business, not by taxing people and businesses more. On the contrary. A safe and good society is created with reforms that equip us for the future, by encouraging change, activity and work.""]","<|system|>

Although recent years have been overwhelming in politics, in Iceland and abroad, the main lines of foreign policy are clear, and the main points are the same as before: to ensure national security and defenses, economic interests and cultural independence of the nation, as well as to honor basic rights of human rights, human rights, and equality. During the one hundred years since Iceland became a free and sovereign state, with the Treaty 1918, these main lines have been the same, although the Icelanders have taken the first steps in foreign and protective affairs as part of the Danish kingdom. One hundred years ago, Iceland was officially engaged in the society of the nations, and the same began with other Western countries, which enjoy freedom and democracy, human rights, and free economy. World War II assured the Icelanders that the old neutral course no longer ensured peace and security. So it was necessary to withdraw from it and become part of the security community of Western democracy. The government covenant states: The government emphasizes that the national security issues are on a firm hold. Iceland's national security policy, agreed by the General Assembly, will be guided. The lines have also been clear in foreign trade. During the first few years of the Commonwealth period, the Icelandic government sent a representative, a so - called fishing representative, to make markets abroad. The few fishermen were out of the scope of a great business that the foreign service has done in recent years. Ever since the Icelanders took the foreign affairs into their own hands, foreign service has sought to secure export interests and to work on a national vacation store. Of these injuries, there is involvement in Europe's Free Trade and the European Economic Area. Iceland has had the wisdom to control its integrity in these matters, and the government has shaped a decisive stand on the European Union, as the Treaty states that national interests are best protected by continuing outside the European Union. With the sovereignty, Iceland's successful cohesion with the northern states began gradually. will continue to be one of the cornerstones of Iceland's foreign policy. The next year, Iceland's preeminence in the Northern Union, which also includes consultations with the Baltic States, spreads the Eastern Atlantic Union. This year, we also begin precociously in the Arctic Council, supporting scientific cooperation, sustainable use of resources, and indigenous issues in many areas. In view of the rapid change in the north, the member countries of the Council are being guided by the 17 UN's global objective of sustainable development. Despite the success of one hundred years of sovereignty and republic, the nation has often gone through difficult times. I remember the many who were killed in securing exports during the war years, but it is estimated that 211 people, or 0.17% of the population, died of the war, reached the same ratio as for the United States. The unity of the Cold War and the hard time for a decade ago, when financial crisis began, was still under way for the Icelanders. So it is important to remember that the success of the nation depends on its outside circumstances and its ability to understand the changes in the environment, to respond to the call of time, and to respond properly. After the fall of the Soviet Union, so to speak, the safety of northern and northern Europe was relatively out of the question, even when the U.S. government decided to move their defenses away from Iceland. However, there is now an uncertainty period in European security issues that need to be addressed specifically. The chemical weapon attack in the English town of Salisbury at the beginning of March is a serious violation of international law and a threat to safety and peace in Europe. Chemical weapons have not been used in the continent since the end of World War II. To date, the response of the Russian government to the attack has been irrefutable, and its declarations have proved unfaithful. The attack has called into harmony with Western activities. The North countries, many member countries of the Atlantic Community and various EU Member States decided to take action against the Russian government. The Icelandic government decided, in agreement with the State Department of State, to participate in this operation and has all two-sided meetings with Russian officials and high officials being suspended for an indefinite period of time. As a result of the decision, in the coming summer, Icelandic rulers will not attend the Russian World Cup soccer tournament. A respectable president. Once again, we will ensure our safety through active participation in the defense activities of Western nations, the Atlantic Alliance, and the defense agreements against the United States. Good defenses and intensive surveillance of the North Atlantic are a major element of that topic. Safety in Europe also calls for active participation in European countries, including Iceland, in diverse regional partnerships, where representatives of nations that are at odds with politics, community structure, and values are likely to meet. In such a case, the Icelanders can do their part, sometimes taking the lead, to improve their relations and cooperation with nations and to speak the speech of democracies, rights, and commercial freedoms. Last year, Iceland's leadership in the Baltic Council ended where the first Ministerial Conference in the Council was successful after Russian military power was exercised in Ukraine. A respectable president. I have regularly given a talk, and publications have helped me to see that the world's commercial patterns are changing and that the Icelanders have to change their work accordingly. Today, the lines of business that were simple and wide for decades are inexplicable and subject to laws other than those of earlier times in speed, communication, and technology. To win a new export market in distant continents and to increase export income, all the equipment we have, especially the foreign services, must be used. Iceland's Foreign Service is a living tool to ensure the widespread interests of Iceland abroad. Economics and priorities change the nature of the situation, and the foreign service needs to take into account, as well as honor the methodology that the nations have agreed to use in international relations and reflect in the Vienna Convention on political relations. My first report as Minister of Foreign Affairs to the Council, less than a year ago, was given much of the objective of foreign affairs. Enrolled by the government budget and endeavored to demonstrate clear goals, standards, and measures in a clear way. The report that I present at the General Assembly today goes further in this regard, and I enjoy that by the autumn, a report called Foreign Service will be completed. Economic security in the changing world has been officially introduced. The report on foreign services was the result of extensive work in the Ministry and consultations with a number of stakeholders in the community. It presents a 151 proposal for action to strengthen the work of the foreign service. My report on foreign affairs that I present today gives more attention to the planning and activities of foreign service than has been established so far. This is in view of giving the General Assembly and the public better insight into assignments and jobs of foreign service, which have often been difficult to deal with because of the confidentiality and delicate status of the cases being handled. So I would like to spend some of my time here today explaining how the changes in foreign service are meant to strengthen the political policy. It is safe to say that there is now the most extensive change in foreign service for a long time. Prior to the end of June the following, it is assumed that more than 70% of the procedure in the above - mentioned report will be implemented. Two new offices are now at the Ministry, i.e. a new Ministry Department office, and the restoration has been a special defense office. New departments have gone into operation, including the home ambassador's department and the administrative department, as well as the information department has been given a new role in managing the analysis of various issues, such as the European Economic Safety Unit. In the development - working office, new departments for employment and regional cooperation have taken part in the work and the branch of international development teaming will lead to the vast cooperation of the Northern Community and the Baltic States of the International Bank when Iceland operates prehumanity in cooperation to two years (2019◯2021). In addition, the New Calculator Department has been established and the work of the Icelandic Peace Guard has been promoted by moving it to the Defense Office. I am certain that a new organization will be needed to strengthen the Ministry's work. The Foreign Service needs to go hand in hand with employment into the new market area and provide it with assistance, especially in countries where a public body is needed to pay for a business ticket. To open doors to new markets, a work post is needed on distant continents. Iceland's embassies have long had large districts, and it is often difficult to care for districts other than the accommodations. To meet this problem, they've established a new home emissary. An answer to many countries has been taken to Iceland and committed to experienced emissaries who will be in charge of these countries from Iceland. There has been a new life in the arrangement where ambassadors at home have also been organized into groups of languages or themes, thus forming a stronger link with Icelandic employment and further trades, innovations, and ideals. Five ambassadors are now doing business in the department and are carrying out many kingdoms, but they also have important issues, such as geologic and equality. In some 90 different countries, a new legal department oversees some 230 voters. Residents are important to the provision of foreign service for business services and civil services. There is also a reevaluation of the potential number of jurists and their location in individual parts of the world, especially in new market countries. The service of Icelandic citizens abroad is one of the main projects of foreign service. Each month some 700 civilian services reach the Ministry Directorates' office and about 2,200 arrive at the office of emissary. In general, it can be estimated that more than 30,000 things of various means are being passed each year. The Ministry of State has 24 - hour shifts throughout the year for the urgent assistance of Icelandic citizens, wherever they are. There are now 25 emissaries active in 21 countries, i.e. 17 two - sided embassies, four fixed committees in international institutions and four main legal offices. Last year, in Mozambique, the only embassy was shut down, and now this spring, a embassy in Vienna against Austria will fail, but in Vienna it will continue to operate as a regular committee to the European Security and Cooperation Agency. Iceland's emissary agencies are now fired at least possibly. For example, 11 of them, or almost half of them, have only one appointed employee, i.e. Director, from Iceland. Others are local. This is reflected in the mail offices in the report that I now present, which are presented with a new reference to having information about each office. The statistical data collected during the early part of 2017 are published on the relative change of projects, trade, staff and costs, as well as on the state of the post as it is today. Substitutions to the office and main office of foreign services (without translation centres and Iceland offices) except for about 5 billion dollars, 0.61% of total government expenses. For example, in 2007 and 2012, these contributions are less than the proportion of the past few years, but they were 0.7% in 2007 and 2012. The budget for the emissary and the main office have also decreased as a percentage of foreign donations since 2012, with a 40% share, now more than 32%. In terms of total contributions to foreign services, unless they own 2018 subsidies, less than 14,961 million. At least 1.8% of the total cost of the state. It runs about half, or 6,971 million dollars, for development cooperation and international institutions. A respectable president. A special defense office has been rebuilt in the Ministry of State in accordance with the proposal there to submit to the state service report for the future. It reflects the emphasis on defense and security and the determination that we Icelanders are active participants in the security activities of Western nations. A powerful defense office will be equipped to cope with the changes and uncertainty that now exist in our world's security sector. It is responsible for national security and national security policies that reach both active foreign policy, protective policy and public safety. Icelanders must themselves be involved in measures to ensure safety of the country. In recent years, additional safety and protection contributions at home and in the field of NATO have been increased in line with the commitment of Community legislation and to the level of burden. It has been developed to renew and improve the protection infrastructure in Iceland, support hostilities in air space management, contribute funds to the Community support and campaign fund, and increase the active participation of civil experts in Community projects. Initiating protective workers in the area of safety at Keflavour Airport and the operation of the radar system, which covers a vast region of the North Atlantic, is an important factor in Iceland's contribution to the joint defenses of the Community. A substantial support has been obtained from the NATO stock and has been authorized from the fund for the renewal of radar stations at a value of 22.4 million euro. Iceland's share is about 3 million euro. For some time now, Icelanders have been active participants in Community defence exercises and thus have been well trained. The Dynamic Mongoose submarine search program was conducted in Iceland's jurisdiction in June 2017 and is now being prepared to participate in the defense practice Trident Junography in the fall of 2018. In addition to this, Iceland is engaged in the Northern Challenge practice every year, her goal is to practice bombing and response to terrorism. NATO, an air - space guard in this country, is unmistakably low and is a factor in looking out for the lower borders of the Community. There have been increasing consultations with various treaties and cooperations in national security and defenses over the years. Takes Iceland, including. joined in the civil part of the Norwegian Defense Team. Toward the end of 2017, Iceland became a member of the Norwegian agreement, which facilitated the arrival and departure of unarmed war planes due to a joint exercise or action. For recent years, emphasis has been placed on active involvement in disarmament issues. Iceland and Ireland are pre-eminents in the missile monitoring system of 2017-2018, but the cooperation is about limiting the spread of missile technology for the arms delivery system, including mass destruction of weapons. In the fall of the year, Iceland is the host for the Atlantic Community's group on disarmament and mass destruction weapons. The work of civil experts by the Icelandic Peace Guard is now well-founded within the frame of NATO. Experts have worked in Afghanistan, Georgia, and Estonia. In addition, an assessment of a training project for bomb - disposal experts in Iraq has been performed, and representatives of the Land Security Bomb Squad are being aimed at doing more. In 2017, there were six members of the Icelandic Peace Guard who joined the ÖSE campaign in Armenia, Albania, and Georgia. A respectable president. I'd like to take particular action in the affairs of the North, which are more and more important to us Icelanders. There is still an opportunity to get things right in the north, so it will become a sustainable development in the spirit of the United Nations, not out of control, but of the United Nations. Rapid changes in the environment of the north may have a major impact on the environment and on the lives and survival of people around the world. Thus, the North Sea, especially member states of the Arctic Council, has been entrusted with a heavy responsibility for which they have to render an account for future generations. The Arctic Council has established itself as the most important area of consultation on the issues of the north. Iceland is leading the Council of 2019◯2021. It is important that this lead and Iceland succeed in showing leadership, professionalism and forethought. Industry gives the Icelanders an opportunity to focus on sustainable development, sustainable communities and work against the negative impacts of climate change in the north to have a sound base among the states and members of the council. In this context, the sea, energy, and indigenous positions need to be directed toward the sea. Easy sailing through the North Sea has aroused the interest of great shipping nations, and there is expectations of easier access to night resources. In the treaty of the government, there are some. Emphasize Iceland's speciality as a Arctic state, with a large proportion of economic laws in the north. Therein lies the possibility of increasing sailing and other activities but also of challenges to the environment, life, and life - style. This will highlight a neighboring relationship with Faeroe Islands and Greenland and Westnoric cooperation. The Ministry of State is now taking shape for Iceland's prehumanity in the 2019 and North Pole activities. It's going to even be there. Provide scientific cooperation in the Arctic and work force on environmental protection and on the issues of the oceans located in Akureyri, as well as for strengthening work on the search and saving of the region and on the progress of non-inferiority issues. A key element in Iceland's foreign policy is to ensure the sustainable use of the living resources of the ocean in the spirit of the United Nations Sea rights Convention and related agreements. This also applies to the marine region in the North Sea. By the end of 2017, a landmark meeting of ten countries on the heads of fish in the North Ocean outside the jurisdiction of countries reached, but discussions had taken place since December 2015 and the formal signing of the binding contract in the mid- 2018. This is a great stage of joy and joy. The Treaty on Fishing in the North Sea extends to the oceans and implies, in short, that its members will commit themselves not to vote for fish in the Convention until scientific research has laid the groundwork for sustainable fishing. With Iceland's involvement to the contract, in the future Iceland will be assured to make decision-making and research teamwork in this critical ocean area. For a long time, the work of the European Economic Area has been very extensive in the work of foreign service. In addition, major efforts have been required to ensure Iceland's interest in eviction from the European Union and thereby from the EEA community. In recent years, it is obvious that the European Commission and legislators have faced a significant problem with the implementation of the EEA Convention. Retake and induction of the EEA species have been reduced from time to time to influence these types at the formative level. The management list for EU interest management has been revised for 2018 and is defined as Iceland's most important issues of interest within EU legislation. The Ministry of State is working on the analysis of Iceland's views on the shape of legislation within the EU and monitoring on issues related to Icelandic interests. The key to effective interest in developing legislation within the European Economic Area is to introduce Iceland's views early in the process. A great deal of effort is needed in these areas. In this regard it is necessary to make use of the opportunities available to Iceland under the EEA Convention to influence the shape of new EEA regulations. It is available to include in specialist groups that the European Commission shall agree on the shape of legislation. I'd like to apply myself for increasing information flows to the General and Management Board and stakeholders on the European legislation in the water. The new EEA database provides an opportunity for more consultation than about 250 management experts now have access to the database and can use it to perform joint analysisal work on policy-making documents in the EU building legislation within the base. Also, the basis provides an overall view of EEA's activities ranging from the formative level to the uptake of the EEA Convention, production of Icelandic legislation and possible treatments associated with the EFTA and EFTA centres. The aim is to provide information from the database available to the Generals, stakeholders and the public to increase their access to the EEA. A respectable president. The world is changing fast, much faster than most know. We live at a time when the Chinese intermediate class has become more numerous than the people of the United States and Canada combined, new shipping routes may open sooner than ever before, which will change globally and no longer have geographic boundaries. There's a lot of opportunities, but they're not self-important, they're going to be competitive. Whether we Icelanders succeed in that contest depends on us. I give high priority to the State Department of Business Services and to assist with a market search, either on standard markets or on new markets. The plan is to strengthen the embassies in Asia with more business representatives, as well as new legislatators in major cities. Iceland's embassies have local knowledge and network and provide diverse services for companies. In particular, emphasis is on promoting the services of a new creation company in the high - tech industry and creative branches. The possibility of opening business offices in East Asia and the California high-tech region is under way on the west coast of the United States. I would like to conclude with our contribution to development by the Icelanders. Less than half of the funding for foreign service goes to development cooperation and international organisations, less than 7 billion. Public contributions are not the only way to finance development cooperation, to activate employment life for better development jobs, in line with international appeals, and to promote investments and commerce. This is the message from an international conference on funding development in Addis Ababa in 2015 and for Iceland in consultation with the recent OECD peer review committee. They are now working on making Icelandic experts and specialized companies, e.g. in the soils and seas, better able to use their knowledge for the poor of the nations, especially through the World Bank and Food and Agriculture Organization. [[The president calls.]] Much is expected of the new branch of regional and professional cohesion within the Department of State Department of State."", ""A respectable president. Today, for the third time, I report to the minister of foreign and international affairs, which have been given a significant place in the conference's discussions of this vast and important category. Much of the information is being covered in these discussions and the contents of the report indicate that the last loss has been particularly widespread in foreign affairs, whether in international, security, business, development, or national rights. Foreign and home have been an abundance of projects in management and civil services. The report is an extensive document, and I hope that it can be used well by members of the Parliament. It is noted that this report clearly sets out key objectives in each case and looks forward to what will happen in the near future. Is this an important addition to this report necessary to look at the road ahead rather than just the guards who have been on the road up to this point. A respectable president. The issue is that international cooperation calls for all nations of the world, large and small, to care for their duties, and to take responsibility for the better. Of course, this applies also to us Icelanders. One basic obligation to the government is to secure citizens, homes, and homes. The threat of terror has been maintained in our neighbors, whether they are in the northern or continent of Europe. The terrorist attacks in Paris in January and November, Copenhagen, February, Turkey, and the United States, as well as other similar events in 2015, impressed and reminded us that there are no national threats. Terrorism is primarily the cause of innocent citizens. Moreover, events show the need for nations to work together in order to ensure their own safety. The aim of terrorist forces is, especially, to plant seeds of fear and to shake foundations such as freedom, democracy, tolerance, and equal rights of individuals regardless of religion or background. The response of the international community is always one way - the failure to remain in the fight against terrorism and the support of those baseline values. Of course, it is not the exception of Iceland, and we stress that we shoulder our burdens. In this context, it is appropriate to remind you of the importance of setting up a national security programme for safety and protection in Iceland. Last year, I gave a hearing of a national security proposal for Iceland based on the proposals of a Senate committee appointed to all members of the General Assembly. paritaprevir Valgerður's Bjarnadóttir, and he worked on the basis of Congress since 2011 when my predecessor had submitted. In the proposal, marketed overall policies on safety and protection for the next five years are as well as within which active foreign policy, protective policy and public safety are defined as critical factors such as increasing participation in Atlantic Community activities as in the defense of the United States. Such policies are important and are actually a turning point where for the first time from the Republic of Germany, there is a progressive step toward a global national security policy. I stress that such a policy has never been more urgent to governments. For an armyless country, it is very important to have solid cooperation with our major allies in the security and defenses of the country. The Atlantic Alliance and the United States Defense Convention have the most important support for Iceland's security and protection services. In the case of the defense agreement, the United States and Iceland's cooperation in defense and security has been strengthened again over the last two years, including in view of increasing safety profiles in the European environment. The European Commission will continue to ensure the maintenance and management of important defenses in Iceland, an important link in the common defenses of the Atlantic Community. Over the past few years, the Atlantic Community has worked progressively to adapt to changes in Europe's environment, in accordance with the decision of the Wales summit in 2014. Clearly, the alliance is facing the new security challenges. On the one hand, Russia's actions to Ukraine and the growing business of the Russian military have created tensions and anxieties of many alliances, especially in Eastern Europe. However, the rise and action of Islamic extremists in the Middle East and North Africa have caused disaster and chaos in the region and fueled a century of international terrorism, as I previously reported. Security scourgings on the southern border of the Community, Syria, Iraq, and North Africa are diverse, and it is important to keep them from being solved by military operations alone. Safety is first achieved when divisive forces are removed and people are assured of a viable being based on freedom, democracy, general human rights, prosperity, and justice. In this light, Iceland's voice and contribution can be viewed internationally. Peace, security, and development are interwoven. One manifestation of the dissension produced by wars is the flow of refugees. We watched this last year to over 1 billion. a man fled to Europe from terror and strife in the Middle East. In Europe, refugees lose the hope of a peaceful existence and better living conditions. The situation is truly serious, and this has brought great distress. The situation in Europe is one thing, but looking to the world in general, the numbers are striking. The United Nations Refugee Organization estimates an estimated 60 billion. People are now in a state of security after their homes have been driven by wars, natural disasters, or bad economic conditions at home. The five - year conflict in Syria has triggered the wave of refugees, which is the greatest since World War II. It is estimated that there are now about 6.6 billion. The Syrians are protected in their own country, and well over 4.5 million more have fled the country. In neighboring lands, a large number of Syrian refugees are now starting their lives in an neglected refugee camp. At that time, Syrian refugees who have attended Europe are now 1 billion. There are more than 200 of them. children and adolescents Iceland has put its weight on the scales and taken various measures. Late in 2015, the government decided to provide 2 billion dollars. to deal with the refugee problem and the State Department will spend 750 million. K. to support the world's international and civil organizations. In this context, I would like to review recent trips to Israel and Palestine, which was the first mission of foreign ministers to both states since 2007. The purpose of the trip was to get to know the situation in the region personally and to present the key messages of the Icelandic government to debate the two states, the solution called, the respect for international human rights and humanitarian laws, and the condemnation of all violence. My visit to the Aida refugee camp in Palestine and the Zaatar refugee camp in Jordan, near the Syrian border, gave insight into the lives of these people. Our minds are lost in a discussion of international affairs, such as human rights, human peace, and stability. It is based on confidence in one another and on the preeminence of countries in their relationships. I have previously said from this chair that nothing is better to promote such trust and fear than to promote the commercial affairs of the nations. Thus, our position as a small nation with a highly exported economy is best provided outside the federal alliances and with freedom to operate in the field of free shopping, whether we are one of our own or in other ways, e.g. with EFTA. A very important part of this work is a business contract with other countries that seek to create Icelandic companies and businesses which have access to foreign markets. The initiative at Europe's Free Trade Association, EFTA, plays one of the main roles in our foreign policy when it comes to business, although it is not always high. It is a desirable goal to be able, as we have been able to do, to participate in Europe's Free Trade Associations as well as to make our own contracts. We are currently seeing that countries, even important commercial states of Iceland, are now becoming less and less business ventures, including business barriers. in order to protect domestic food production or as part of an action to promote such production at home. Examples of such are well - known and close to mention Russia and Nigeria in this context. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to give high priority to strengthening the network of free trade agreements, as is required in the government covenant. In this matter, particularly to complete free trade agreements with the Asian new market, to speed up negotiations with Mercosur, South America, and to start a review of EFTA and Canada. Of course, Japan is also on this list, so I take it out specifically. It is also important to stress that there is work to identify Iceland's interests as related to the development of multinational business contracts that Iceland does not have but may open up to new countries. Will be the most direct light to the Treaty of the Pacific, called TPP, and the EU and U.S. Convention, which we call TTIP. The Ministry's export service is a very important part of the work, and in the following few days it will be emphasised on serving as fully as possible in foreign markets. This applies not only to representatives from the Ministry of State but also to emissaries in which clients play a key role. They promote further growth in the Icelandic economy. Advertisers, companies, and individuals who have benefited from this important work know that it is necessary to strengthen these activities, at the very least, to end the application of the Icelandic people in foreign markets. The most important national rights given to the State Department are the lawsuits. They have long established a major role in Iceland's foreign affairs, and Iceland has always been the leading member of international cooperation in this area. We depend largely on this group of languages and laws to develop in a practical way and for all countries to respect international rights in dealing with countries and to maintain peace and security in the international community. Looking forward to the future lies ahead of extensive marine projects that can become a major concern for the oceans and sustainable use of resources there. We are in a special position when it comes to these matters. The responsible fishing management over the last few decades and the success it has produced creates a strong position to actively participate in negotiations to protect from controlled fishing in the North Sea and on biodiversity outside the jurisdiction of countries. The Ministry's focus will be that the ocean's affairs will be dealt with on the basis of the marine rights and agreements associated with it. The rights of coastal countries to sustainable use of the living resources of the ocean and to the fact that fishing is local or regional, not global, will also be emphasized. In general, global resource and environment coverage is increasing. Last year was somewhat special in terms of the end, the historic stage for the UN Climate Convention held in Paris last December. It is legally binding under the United Nations Climate Convention and will take action after 2020. For the first time, all the countries of the world are determined to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, deal with their consequences, and ensure considerable financial support for climate change and to assist countries that will be worst affected by these changes. Iceland was among the countries who wanted ambitious agreements, such as the aim to keep global warming below 1.5 °C. Iceland was also involved in integrating gender equivalents, the use of renewable energy, the importance of forestry and agriculture for carbon binding, etc. We conducted a few publicity meetings in Paris. What a joy it is that an agreement has been reached, and then it is crucial that words be fulfilled! Further implementation at the Paris Convention is now in hand, and negotiations reject the European Union and Norway on how to share the responsibility. I'd like to mention here the Green Climate Fund that we've funded and is extremely important, and we'll continue to look ahead. A second major international milestone was reached last year when the UN's new development objective for sustainable development was adopted in September. Is that a cause for great rejoicing and the result of a huge job that lay ahead of us? We actively participated in these negotiations about the objectives, their implementation and follow-up. World goals are ambitious and valid for all Member States, both within the country and in international cooperation. They form a framework for the United Nations work until 2030 and are intended, among other things, to bring an end to world poverty, to control mankind's environmental problems, and to work on equal social opportunities. Now that the goals have gone into effect, the government has accepted measures and special funding to help achieve them. A respectable president. In the past, I began to conclude that the peace, security, and development of the world are closely interwoven. In this, developing cooperation plays a vital role that is growing. By Christmas, the Allied Council approved a bill on change in law No. 121/2008, of Iceland's international development team, as most people here remember. Working on this by having the entire group on one hand, hoping to get a better perspective and an increased level of coordination and efficiency. In addition, the new arrangement is a strengthening of the link between development and other foreign affairs. Thus, during the first months of 2016, there have been organizational changes that will result in law. The work has been well started and is being done on a variety of issues related to the harmony, the preparation of procedures, procedures, principles of action, a new quality manual, etc. All the employees offered a job accepted this, and their reception in the Ministry has been particularly considered. Work on government policy in Iceland's international development team for the period 2017-2021 is in the final stages and will be submitted to the General Assembly and a plan of action for the period 2017/2018. Our policy, of course, takes into account the UN's global objectives on sustainable development and the chief objective of the work is to reduce poverty and contribute to general well - being on the basis of equality and sustainable development. The development of social infrastructure, sustainable use of resources and work for peace will continue as well as the scope of humanitarian assistance. Then there will be equality between the sexes and the environment and the climatic issues, a subject of the new policy. I would also like to mention continued negotiations at the United Nations University for the United Nations International School of the United Nations. A respectable president. Iceland's foreign service is one of the least in Europe, even though the nation is few. In recent years since collapse, foreign services have had to cut down significantly on their business, as do others, and we have shown the most objectiveness in the operation. The results have naturally been the inevitable result of our gathering in the ministry, but the Ministry is primarily a service agency. Although the demand has increased, especially when it comes to business services, the number of employees'budget is steadily decreasing. No matter what the size of the nations, there are tasks in international relations. I'd like to mention the civil service, where the pressure has increased, but it's expected that your civil service will exceed 30 of you. Events every year. Then an Icelandic e - mail office finds a growing interest in Iceland and Iceland's products and travel to the country. Therefore, the restoration of foreign services is to be welcomed. In this year's budget, 2016, the General Assembly decided to strengthen foreign service by less than 5%, and I am delighted to do so. A respectable president. The international exchange and the di·po·loʹa that we do not always have to deal with. I'd like to mention that our equality cases have made a great contribution to our work and that we, along with others, have been standing before so - called barbarics, which have drawn attention to the importance of their male equality. We recently held a conference at the world headquarters of the Atlantic Community, and we also held a conference at Geneva in the United Nations with the UN Refugee Institute for Refugees. [[The president calls.]] More such conferences will be held. A respectable president. My time has passed. I could have said a few more words, but I would have stopped studying in my background and hope that there will be a good discussion today."", 'Mr. President. First, I want to thank you for the talk I have here, one hour, and try to make good use of it. I saw the highest. The president looked especially at me when he mentioned that men were not obliged to speak for an hour. I will try to make good use of that time and may not say that there will be some entertainment, but I will try to be perturbably involved in the issues of this important financial bill of the Government of Katrín, Jakobsdóttir\'s daughter. In recent years, public economic plans have been based on excessive optimistic assumptions about economic developments, and the temporary increase in income has been relied on on intensification. There has been little effort to ensure that plans did not make enough money to finance needed expenses. The Environment Directors of the bill are set up on Iceland\'s Habitat project since October. However, that forecast changed somewhat from June onward. The estimate shows that there is greater uncertainty about the economic outlook in this country that is reflected in plans and projections for economic growth. After a long economic development, Iceland\'s Haggis assumes almost no economy this year than that he will be back next year and will be about 1.7%. Propaganda is 0.9% lower than previous predictions. Certainly a man, Mr. President, hopes that this will work, but there are a lot of uncertainty in this, especially international uncertainty issues such as developments in our business countries, oil prices and the position of the currency, etc., so the forecast may not come true. Of course, we hope that this will happen and that economic growth will take place in a new year. The financial and economic secretary\'s letter to the financier, dated November 7th, shows that the bill was updated by data submitted since the protocol was completed in June. According to the motion of a greater part of the budget, the state funds will be expelled at about 11 billion dollars. Do it now. Similarly, by 2020 the government\'s income decreases by 10.6 billion dollars. Critically, the government is going to finance the budget for the fiscal bill because of changes in economic forecasts, as well as changes made by the government groups at 2 arr., by selling carbon dioxide emissions sources, at least a quarter of the budget. 4.8 billion. It should be noted that during the last year, emissions were sold for about 30 years. 2.5 billion bucks. There are many indications that in the future the government will have to buy these quotas back at a much higher price, since Iceland does not seem likely to be able to stay within its releases. The government has to argue that this arrangement is reasonable for the future before any financial process is passed or that it simply retracts this proposal. It also focuses on the huge increase in carbon pay paid by the common people, particularly on the region. I\'ll take a closer look at that later. In addition, it is critical that the government is going to take on its own money of Icelandic students at a rate of 4.2 billion. to meet changes in the income side of the state fund because of changes in economic forecasts. In other words, the loan fund of Icelandic students is to be paid up a portion of the balance of government funds. It would have been a story to the next town at some point. Even if the position of the fund is good, this arrangement is unwise now that governments plan to change the loan system. Forethought changes in which 30% of the loan is made in the form of a scholarship will mean a greater demand for loans. In addition, the above letter states that fishing costs are due to a decrease of 2.1 billion dollars. in the bill on the basis of evidence of the expected calculation of fishing bills in the next year of fishing, taking into account the large investments of the fishing industry. Of course, we support the central category of investments, the vital factor, and many of the secondary work of fishing. However, the question can be asked, "" Why is this issue so late?\'and whether there is evidence of the expected calculation, as mentioned, that the calculation is not complete and not settled, or that there is generally enough evidence to be considered sufficient support in a case like this. On the part of Iceland\'s Penitentiary Bank, a growing decision in November stated that economic developments may look too optimistic, especially because of the uncertainty of international economic issues, as mentioned at the outset. It is important that current government policy takes into account the realistic reasons for economic progress. Of the OECD, it has been noted that public investments need to be larger in this country and that the next action of the next one is primarily aimed at reducing the impact of subtraction. When the economy, as it has been, slows down, it is urgent that governments take appropriate action. It shows that there is an important need to reinvent and increase investments in the interior. A lot of work is being done, e.g. for example, in transportation and health care. The central category feels that the status and survival of the state funds in the bill should be more addressed based on where we are moving. In addition, we could discuss the contribution of the cash on the market to national production next year. Who will be, for example. the effects of tax doctors and investments when it comes to national production? Considering the budget bill, you can see that there is no more to be expected in 2020. On the contrary, the state\'s funds will be slided, reflecting the fact that the current economic situation is changing. It is important in times of uncertainty that the state\'s debt level is good and that it is safe to commend the government for continuing to pay off debt. This is vital and proves to be successful in the down cycle that is now ahead. Government emphasis on subsidies over the past few years will prove to be an important and positive provision. This situation enables people to cope with economic uncertainty. Of course, the development of the nation\'s exports is of vital importance. In recent years, the nation has had the rise in tourism, the article has become a burden on the commercial life of the people of the land, and the important source of currency. There is an obvious trend in travel services among the main uncertainty factors of the budget. The prospects for travel have a significant impact on the economic leaders of the bill. It is noteworthy, then, that contributions to tourism on the bill decrease to an absolute value of 292 billion. K., i.e. 12.8% from the 2019 budget. According to Iceland\'s Hospital Bank, inflation has been around 3% since spring, but in October it was 2.8%. However, underlying inflation has been more persistent. That the bank\'s judgment is expected to cut faster than was predicted in August and will reach its goal at the end of this year. It is estimated that government companies and funds in Period B along with Civilization will pay 91.3 billion dollars. In the payments next year. That\'s 45.6 billion. and about doubled from the estimated 2019 cities. Again, the biggest direct commitment of the state\'s non-funded Penitentiary due to the B-institution Department of Pension Services, ISR. Nurses\' NlR and Pension Fund ensures that funds are more valuable than industry payers and employers pay in their savings at any given time. The differences between acquired rights and holdings of the B-VlR are guaranteed by the back responsible state funds and by the LSR with responsible state funds and other remunerations. In the coming decades, responsible caregivers will have to contribute these funds as the Department of Pension Act allows to ensure that the funds can be paid for a pension. Important attention is given so that contributions from the fund are shown to keep balance. The central category emphasizes that governments provide the basis for a powerful career, prosperity, and general prosperity. The government\'s tax policy is to include the incentive to increase the number of workers and to improve its terms and to provide conditions for innovation and renewal of tools and equipment and investments in the economy. In this regard, the Central Party places great emphasis on simplifying the governance system and relieving the public of the industry and the homes of the people. Normal efficiency and management must be required for all government activities. On page 18. 3 The committee\'s opinion provides an overview of the changes made by the Central Party to the bill. The suggestions are complete, and they do not contribute to the interest of government funds. I\'ll get in touch with these suggestions below, but I\'m going to take the next step to the section of the Committee that bears the headline Prosperation - not to be added to the state plans and regulations. No more government gains, no more ◯ added to the state plans and regulations. Mr. President. Education and effectiveness should always be carried out in the treatment of public funds. The financial bill gives evidence that the government\'s list of projects is not the top priority. There goes the leading member of the Independence Party, which has regularly cried out loud for elections away in the first place. Then, when the pack reaches power, the stall continues to grow. ▪ We need to clean up our financial affairs and reduce the state\'s perspective, as the secretary of finance said in 2010. A minister is now offering a financial bill that is still being added to the State Department. The state has spread in the history of this government, and no attempts have been made to reduce the rate of state activities. Is that contrary to what the Independence Party has proclaimed for each election? Increase in funding for the Ministry of Presidency since 2018 is 876 million. K. Increasing to environmental management since 2018 is 1,218 million. K. which is an increase of 35%. Between 2019 and 2020 an increase of 572 million. For example, K. Clearly, the Ministry has, on behalf of the government, neglected its role in evaluating the impact of a prime project on the burden of employment. Very limited work has been done to consider existing legislation and how to simplify it, lower the burden of rule, and reduce competitiveness. This is a very important subject. A lot of regular work comes from the European Union through the EEA Convention. It is apparent that in terms of the contract of a prime project to introduce EEA rules, the Ministry is not currently using the scope Iceland has to ease the burden of order but, contrary to the burdensome rules it adds. Studies have shown that this has been done in one third of the cases of induction of new EEA legislation. A number of such examples have been identified by professional drivers. It\'s supposed to be the policy of every government to simplify a rule book. Year after year the work of the management system in Iceland is growing and the costs it brings. This cost is paid by taxpayers. It is vital to reduce the burden of rule and to reduce blundering. In recent years, there has been not much economy within the Council of Government. It is long time to attack the public system and reduce the public activity. In addition, it is unwise to continue to add to the Kingdom display, where changing the government\'s revenues can be a source of hardship and pain. So government priorities need to be better established. For example, the context of the United Nations Organization\'s Association and the Bank of Iceland should include economic management. Interestingly, when the united plans were presented, it was specifically noted that there was no room to reduce the number of employees. It\'s the wrong approach, Mr. President. Unions should include saving to taxpayers. In addition, the pay in the budget has increased dramatically during recent years and is high in relation to the private sector. The increase in budgets beyond the general price increase is rule rather than exception. The government becomes more and more expensive to taxpayers. This adds up the costs of state surveillance. The bill has little country support requirements. The Independence Party now known to represent the Ministry of Economics and Economics has the capacity to handle this situation, as he has so many sermons. Rather, he adds to the Kingdom display as never before. The fact is that when government agencies are united, no single economy will be made on the part of the government. A fine example of this is the unity of UNECE and the Federal Bank, as mentioned earlier. Governments must look to the opportunities that will create for economic management in the unity of these two institutions. For one reason at unity, there is a problem that arises from the present system of things. There is a clear opportunity to match both institutions and opportunities to make a living without affecting quality. In addition, it is warranted to make an independent assessment of the budget management account for unity with the National Bank. There are many things that are not clear about unity. The budget paid by financial companies for the FME is about 2.3 billion dollars. Over the past few years, they\'ve gone up a lot. Budget companies are increasing the cost of data processing and data cutoffs by the Rapporteur. The FME and Secret Bank could be manipulated by joint support centres and the harmonization of data between institutions. The story has shown that the cost of the government tends to increase with its institutions and is intended to expand its housing for a good example in the Union. The Central Party proposes a transition to the bill that 15% of the economy will be created by the state as a result of its union with the Federal Bank and the SEC. That should save the state budget about 350 million. K. every year. Iceland is a small country, so it is even more important in this country than in most other countries to consider practical in as many areas as possible. In 2020, the central category is bringing a change to the budget for the 2020 budget, which aims to reduce the state\'s attitude and to demand an economy of more than 10% in the management business of all schemes. The money will be given to the government\'s funds at $1.1 billion. In addition, there is a special economy crisis between Iceland\'s Secret Bank and the SEC up to 350 million. K. ... asI usedto say. Thus, a total of 1,450 million government profits are being made. K. in 2020. On page 18. 5 In this article, you will find a table on the practicality requirement required by the Central Ministry. Next thing I want to do, the importance of reducing the insurance bill further. That action is necessary and is reasonable and is in addition to the decline that has been offered in the bill. As the year has passed, employment markets have deteriorated. Looks like it\'s going to be. Some 7,000 people are now out of work on the work programme and have increased by over 2,700 since the same time last year. More than 1,000 people have lost their jobs in museums for the past year, as well as the 1,100 who lost their jobs at the fall of WOW air. Governments should always seek to strengthen the work environment of Icelandic enterprises, especially now that the economic environment is less winding up the sails. Icelandic companies need to meet rising pay costs in the years to come and resist loss of employment. Icelandic tax returns are high in international comparison, with the highest in the Northern countries behind Norway. In an effort to close the budget, companies were raised after the 2008 financial collapse. However, tax changes have been taking place ever since. It\'s been a failure for the government to cut down the insurance fee, which is one of the largest stock markets in the state, but according to the bill, it will be due to 11% of the next year\'s tax fees. High insurance costs are worst for companies where pay and pay-or-remuneration are largely expensive. High insurance costs undermine the competitiveness of these companies. The improved competitiveness of Iceland is very important, and especially when the economy is slowed down rapidly. Especially does the government\'s government\'s contract highlight the reduction of the insurance fee, but it is not enough for our Middle Class. In addition, industrial organizations have concluded the same way. The competitiveness of domestic enterprises towards foreign rivals has deteriorated over the past few years because of the domestic cost increase measured in foreign currency. This trend is now evident in the less valuable production of exports and enterprises on the national markets that compete with foreign companies. For the 2008 economic collapse, the bail bill was 5.34%, but it was promoted to 8.655% following it. The increase was thought of as a temporary operation to cover a huge increase in expenses due to sudden unemployment. The premise for the rise and the evidence that was then used to raise the cost no longer apply, since unemployment has been low in a long period of time. Unemployment was 3.7% in September and had declined since the preceding month. ASI has recently shown that it is important to return an increase in the insurance bill. It is a wonder that governments have been reluctant to reduce their insurance fees because the benefits are repeated. The fact is, however, that the tax paid has increasingly been used to finance other financial expenses. If the decline is to contribute to the balance of the job market and to the less pay raise in the next year, it needs to be more than 0.25%. The pay is calculated as a percentage of the salary paid by the company to its employees. The more dollars the company pays in pay, the more money it will be paid in terms of insurance. The higher the insurance bill, the more expensive the employee is for his company. The higher the percentage, the less pay, the less the company can live up to. The price reduces the ability of an enterprise to invest and create jobs. Therefore, private companies\' growth potentials are blocked by high insurance costs. The central category is moving the change proposal to the bill that the insurance rate drops by 0.25% next year in addition to the expected fall in the bill. With the approved change of the proposal, their rate will decrease from 6.35% to 6.10%. It is reasonable to assume that these taxes will be no greater than they were before a collapse when the level of employment was comparable to ours. In spite of the fact that insurance is still short, it is the same percentage of corporate pay as it was for the financial breakdown. The effects of the reduction of insurance costs by 0.25% next year in addition to the proposed reduction in the bill are negative for the state\'s budget of about 2 billion dollars. The Middle Party\'s proposal is full of resources and can be considered in committees rather than in others. the central category assumes that the construction site of the National Bank on Eastern Sea will be sold and the estimated property value will be about 2 billion dollars. The Land Bank bought the property over five years ago less than a billion bucks. The fortunes of the bank then go into a government fund, but the bank\'s bank owner is 98%. It is also assumed in the Central Party proposal, a secondary section of the budget board, that the construction of the Commission will be postponed and this will result in a further 550 billion. K. for a provision for the treasure of the state. The reduction in the insurance price makes it easier for companies to recruit new employees and do better with what is already being paid, which, in turn, increases the tax pay on the state\'s budget, makes great progress, and especially now, when increasing unemployment is expected. Mr. President. Next time, I want to go to the nurses. The middle class has an adjustment to the bill where 800 million are expected to be put. K. in improving the urgent problems of nursing homes. Nursery is one of the most important foundations of the Icelandic welfare system, and the government has failed to fulfill the plans presented in the Constitution to strengthen the staff of nursing homes and daily training. During the two years that the government has been ruling, it has consistently impaired the flow of nursing homes. A public opinion has shown that nursing management is generally very heavy, and the level of propaganda has increased year by year, in line with the financial limitations of the government. A contract between nursing homes and Iceland\'s Medical Insurance ran out at the end of 2018, when health insurance changed its methodology to finance. It is important that the decision of health insurance has been made without discussions with nursing homes and must be made as it is that it is not the best way to negotiate with a company such as the Social Services Organization or the European Union. The government\'s budget for 2020-2024 shows that the largest public funds project in connection with the media of nursing and rehabilitation services is a campaign involving the proliferation of nurses, both by rebuilding older space and by building new ones, including the development of new ones. with the building of a nursing home. This is a total of over 900 compartments. Governments have proclaimed that more than 700 spaces will be built for 2024 when it is estimated to be over 3,400 total, a 26% increase since 2018. At the same time, the government is assuming only a 6% increase in funding for the business sector, i.e. in nursing homes. Clearly, the budget has taken little account of the construction or business of new nurses and has to be viewed as reprehensible. It is not enough to build a new nursing home, but it must also ensure leading employers for homes so that they can do their job. It is necessary to go to the sheepfolds of the nursing homes seriously and to review the reports of the National Reconnaissance on the topic area. The condition of nurses and medical staff in nursing homes is not easy. The head of Iceland\'s Hospitalist Association said that there was a serious shortage of medical personnel in nursing homes. It has been said that individuals with a great need for service have had to be referred to where there is no medical staff available. Reasons for human failure including Because the nursing home of the country has been paying attention to funding for the ministry during the past few years. The needed supply of business funds has been made to hospitals, clinics, and health care, but nursing homes have been cut down. Organizational organisations in welfare services have repeatedly highlighted the need for support of nursing and residence services and rehabilitation. The world\'s most difficult area is a nursing home. It\'s coming even. This is because it is impossible to achieve the size prosperity achieved by the number of beds that are normally recognized in the capital area. Mr. President. There has to be a credible conversation between the Department of Health, Iceland\'s Medical Insurance, Old Age and Company. The premise of success and a broader agreement on the seminary is an increasing understanding of the nature of nursing homes. It\'s coming even. ... ina reviewofthecompany ofenterprises firms in welfare services. The middle class finds it very important to meet them with problems that exist in this important category and, as previously said, suggest an additional amount of money in the transition to these institutions of 800 million. K. to improve urgent business problems. Mr. President. Next, I\'m going to step back to a chapter of the Commission opinion entitled New taxes reduce the reported tax reduction. There are substantial changes in individual income taxation systems to meet government promises in terms of collective labour market agreements last spring. A three-stage income tax system with a new low - income phase will be adopted that will take place in two stages between 2020 and 2021. So it is estimated that a third of the changes will take place in 2020 and two thirds in 2021. These measures are expected to increase their provision of earnings by 10,000 dollars. per month. At the same time, it is suggested that child - improvement limits rise to 325,000. in a month that will be most likely to affect the most efficient population. There are certain tax increases in the bill, despite the reported tax declines. The increase in the rate of fuel and diesel oil is expected, the rate of automobiles is rising, alcohol and tobacco, the rate of radio pay is rising, the cost of the elderly is rising, the cost of recycling is rising, etc. The new fiscal tax planned by the government for financial work but has been restored as a result of poor preparation will cost the land 6,000 dollars. Next year, $12,000. Every year when he is fully operational and realizes that it is the will of the government that this tax will be laid on, which may be delayed by one year because of the previously poor preparation of the aforementioned tax. Then carbon costs will rise by 10% next year, which will mean an increase in gasoline and diesel oil. Thus, the government is raising a number of taxes and fees that reduce the taxes mentioned above. Thus, taxation to the public is considerably lower than the government has proclaimed. A new three - step tax system goes contrary to the Independence Party\'s policy of simplifying the tax system. The Independence Party\'s financial and economic minister has previously said that three tax steps were a very unfortunate arrangement, and in order to complicate the tax system. In 2019 it is estimated that the annual income of the state\'s funds of new taxes and tax increases will be more than 115 billion. corresponding to approximately 15% of the total tax dollars in the state. Thus, despite the foretold tax returns to 97 billion dollars. in an increase in tax recovery from the last down cycle as a home, and business still stands. In the case of funding new transport projects through special payments of individual roads or user expenditures, as has been done on the part of the government, the nature of the increase in taxes on individuals is, in turn, reducing the provisional resources of the public. If plans become reality in connection with a new transport plan, it is clear that a tax reduction will not be required at the end of this period. Mr. President. Iceland is a state of high taxes on a global scale. The number of tax increases in previous years is largely unmoved. A priority should be to retract the tax increases taken after the collapse of the bank. The government has raised capital taxes, but at the same time it has been promised to reimburse the taxpayer. There\'s no mention of such a reexamination in the budget bill. When the capital tax was taken up, the low tax rate was short with a broad tax factor. The tax stock is still wide, but the tax rate has doubled. The middle class stresses that now that the State\'s debt is rapidly down, there is room to consider reducing the taxes on people and businesses in the country, not increasing the nation\'s affairs, as the government is particularly interested in. The reduction in taxes is a wise arrangement when the economy is downstuffed. True, the government is reducing taxes on the lowest income, but it is raising a number of other fees, so the net tax decline is not what you call them. In Iceland tax returns to the highest in the world when pension money is taken into account. It is long since time to reduce spells in the public and in the business, thus releasing an increase in wealth. It is useful for society to extend its resources to people and businesses. At the same time, countries and communities need to better handle the tax dollars they take to them. Next time, Mr. President, I\'d like to step on the carbon tax and the 10% increase the government is headed for. Here is a chapter in the panel of members of the Central Party\'s Committee on Funds that carry a prescription without carbon tax ◯ do not level the population in fair terms. Natural protection and other environmental protection are among the most important subjects of the day. But government reactions have not been in harmony with this. All too often, they have been based on useless, even harmful virtualism, such as. shows up in new taxes without following the goals or methods of assessing the results. The assessment of success is very important in this regard. It\'s a new tax in Iceland, as we know it. The bill shows that in 2020 income of carbon bills is estimated to be 6.3 billion. The price has already increased by 65% in a very short period of time, two years. Then the carbon will rise by 10% next year, in addition to the 65% increase that has already occurred since 2017. Thus, the carbon price has increased by 82% since 2017, after a 10% increase in the next year, government plans have gone up. In this context, it should also be kept in mind that governments estimate that the State budget will receive 4.8 billion dollars. ... intheflage of sales of documents like I traced here at the beginning. In many parts of the world, government incomes from such emissions are being used to take action in climate. It is unclear how this is being done in this country. On the contrary, the sole purpose of sales seems to be to diminish the balance of the state\'s funds. The government\'s income of carbon tax is not a direct earmark of action on climate, and only part of it runs there. The middle class feels that the increase in this price is all too modest, especially in view of the fact that the results of the tax system cannot be clearly demonstrated. An even further increase of 10% is expected next year and is estimated to result in a government budget of 375 million. K. in income, including side effects on value taxes. At present, the rate of carbon is over 12 pm. each litre of gasoline and diesel, as well as the fuel restrictions, contributes to further increase the pressure on the public and particularly on people in the country. It may be reasoned, Mr. President, that with the carbon bill, citizens of the country are being taxed more than any other end of the electrical carvailing in the capital area, much easier than in the region where supplies are built like loading stations in the capital area than there. Nevertheless, electric car owners have complained that electrical infrastructures are not sufficiently satisfactory in the capital, much less in the region where the infrastructure is simply too far too far away. In addition, inhabitants of the country use much more than that of automobiles driven by fossil fuels, gasoline, and diesel oil, driving more because of their distance, and thus buying more fuel. It would be reasonable to conclude that as a result of the rise in carbon costs, the amount of taxes and the equivalent of environmental activity would be reduced if the objective was to reduce pollution. Not so, though. The main objective of carbon costs is to encourage both homes and businesses to reduce emissions by switching to cleaner energy. First, it is by no means possible for anyone to switch to an electric vehicle, and second, the rest of the vehicle is still suitable in the country. First, it draws near to the limit of the automobiles and the number of loading stations. Thus, the contribution of carbon is different to the population of the capital and to the inhabitants of the region. So there is, in fact, a difference in currency between these groups. Thus, the tax suffers the relatively worst in terms of the income and the inhabitants of the country. Energy exchange encouragement is a good price price, but it has to be in line with reality. Energy exchange for fishing companies, industry, and employment equipment is not a practical option at present. The carbon tax has a direct economic effect on the economy. Without any counterweight measures, the tax weakens the economy and reduces the competitiveness of an enterprise. Ideas are considered noble, but governments must give careful consideration to the purpose, basis, and goal of the tax system, especially who are taxing and who are not taxing. The aim of the expenditure is to reduce emissions without diluting the competitiveness of work life and should be the same in this country. In other countries, therefore, other taxes have been lowered against the price or were given by other taxes. Iceland is, for example. One State in Europe where the fishing fleet has no access or is fortified with fuel taxes. This will further reduce competitiveness. Iceland\'s employment agency has researched domestic expenses, and it shows that fuel use is somewhat higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The difference reflects the fact that the population of the country has to travel more long distances. The financial and economic minister has acknowledged the greater impact of carbon costs on rural population. This is shown in the reply of a minister to a inquiry at the General Assembly. Thus, in fact, the carbon costs are a traditional tax increase on people and companies where taxation is more taxing on the land. So this new tax burden is not balanced on the people of the land. In addition, the Environment Minister has said that the exact results of the cost are difficult to assess, measured in less emissions than if the price had not been passed. This was shown in the reply of a minister to a council inquiry and confirmed by the Environment Ministry at a meeting with a financial committee. No initiatives are being proclaimed on the bills related to the budget that meet the population of the country for the sake of the cost. In addition, it is not apparent that environmental activity will not be involved or that other taxes will be reduced to counterweight. The change in carbon is tax increase, put in a suit of green tax. It would be reasonable, then, to reduce the cost of other environmental factors. We have to look to other countries in this regard. In Denmark, the government did so. too soon when they raised their taxes on the environmental issues of an enterprise. In Norway, carbon costs are lower than Iceland and, in part, reimburse certain conditions. The level of carbon costs must not increase the cost of Icelandic enterprises beyond that of foreign competitors. This reduces competitiveness, reduces the share of the Icelandic enterprises and thereby the means to invest. At the same time, the likelihood that the object of the price will be met diminishes. What further reduces competitiveness is that non-employment tax obligations in this country are the exception of the carbon tax. Thus, foreign ships that take oil in this country do not have to pay the price, but in some cases they are fishing in the same way that they do. A foreign fishing ship, a cruise ship, and a freighter do not pay the carbon price of fueling here on the land, and no carbon tax is paid by local aircraft fuel in the state\'s budget. Although technology is rapidly developing in these areas, larger vehicles, workers, and some industrial instruments are not available to use renewable energy. It belongs, for example. We\'re in the ground sector and agriculture. Thus, energy exchange is not a realistic option at present, especially for the industry and employment equipment that use so - called colored oil, and the potential for such factors for energy exchange is negligible. The amount of carbon is a tax that variously affects the sector\'s sector, and it is reasonable that the overall policy in the case should be taken before continuing. Interestingly, the lack of accurate records over the government\'s contributions to the counterimbursement of projects that may include taxation. related to the contractions of greenhouse gas emissions or improved air quality in general. A spontaneous and natural requirement is that governments publicly publish their plans for the preparation of the carbon account. Thus, the central category suggests that the rate of increase in the carbon bill of 10% in the budget will not be accomplished until the whole policy is established on how to use carbon charges in the battle of climate change without causing it to bite on the land or competitiveness of industry and to reduce the intensity of the economy. The reduction in carbon dioxide costs will reduce inflation pressure with a reduction in fuel price. Mr. President. Next time, I\'d like to step on a planned tax. The financial work was proposed to put a nose tax on people and businesses in the country, but as with taxation on travel services, the government was reassigned to this tax because of poor preparation. However, it is quite clear that the government\'s policy is to impose this tax on me and that it seems to me that it will be placed on the budget in the year. It seems that it is a special interest in the government to put on new taxes and put them on such beautiful costumes and give them names like green taxes. The bill expected to add a so - called price tax to people and businesses that would make up about 1.5 billion of their income during 2020 and 2.5 billion when they were fully involved in the production of 2021. If this plan becomes a reality, it\'s about 6,000 K. The taxation of a family of four in 2020, or will be delayed by year, and it will be about $12,000. when he\'s in full effect. In this regard, it should be noted that in the review of the stakeholders, this taxation rate received a complete decline, especially in preparation, and that it requires careful attention on how the government will conduct it in the future. Clearly, this has a significant impact on e.g. The job life, and it\'s not too critical to go to such taxation without all stakeholders being included. Next time, I\'d just like to step in on the Land Hospital. As I\'ve mentioned here, the Landsaholic is the largest and most important medical facility in the country. He has to appoint outstanding employees who perform unselfish work each day, often under difficult circumstances. A lot of discussions have developed about the hospital\'s problem, and the problem has a wide variety of factors. The point is, the hospital and its services are growing faster than budgets assume, despite the expected actual growth of 1.8% each year. The hospital has taken on new projects that have not been followed. For example, on the part of the directors of health care things have been observed. the so - called efflux problem is not solved, which includes hospital care staff who should remain in nursing homes. Interpretations of collective agreements have been made that have been difficult to assess, including a labour agreement with physicians in 2015. The agreement was good for the health system, but cost factors have been underestimated, and the hospital has not received financial support that is needed to cover the total cost of this contract. In such cases, when a contract is made, it is urgent that it is quite clear what the real cost is for the state and how to deal with it. Healthcare professionals are advised to have adequate medical care and to ensure adequate design at any given time. His greatest challenge is his care for the hospital\'s carers. The health authorities have not produced any plans to deal with them. The Management Board of the Land Hospital has presented a budget for maintenance measures due to the compromise of business. One of these measures is to dissuade from a special facility for nurses due to long-term design problems in the hospital, i.e. through what has been called Hiklu projects, where nurses have been paid stress for their jobs in an effort to attract them to work and to increase their ratio of employment. This is an important project, and it is a concern that we should not lose because it will mean extra overtime, and the overtime will quickly become big numbers in the big context. There is a great shortage of nurses at the Land Hospital, and they share many of them. It is the very nature of this ministry that it is unpredictable in many areas. This is an emergency hospital, and we will never end the emergency services, even if funds have been completed. The hospital will need some kind of flexibility, so we do not face this crisis every year. We must realize that the pressures on health will increase over the next few years and decades as the nation\'s life span increases. If we are to ensure excellent health care for all, our health - care system must be much more efficient. A vivid example of the problem of this system is that patients are sent to foreign countries for measures three times as much as they would cost in Iceland. It does not mean that the government would refer to the administration of the Land Hospital and the administration of the Land Hospital to identify the government. The nation is getting older, and this will mean increased pressures on the system. Older people 80 years of age and older need the highest health care. In addition, new health technology has called for an increase in cost. Governments must face the problem and ensure the long - term funding of the most important health facility in the country. Mr. President. I see my time is beginning to run out, but I\'m just going to step back to the agriculture. The nation\'s basic work from land mines has been attended in various directions. Agrienvironment schemes have declined, and this bill is reduced. There is no mention of the agriculture of the Committee members of a greater proportion of budgetary committees to the budget bill. That may tell you a story. They have succumbed to unfair and dangerous requirements for the increase in food imports that do not meet health requirements, food that are not prepared under the conditions intended in Icelandic agriculture. A very adverse toll agreement has recently gone into effect, and at the same time, it is expected to provide a number of support to Icelandic food producers and consumers. At the same time, there is a growing demand for European agriculture. The situation\'s competitiveness with foreign production continues to mount. Farming and food production are the basis for global living. Not to be overlooked, however, is the country\'s contribution to domestic food production. National food production is required to protect land and sea as one of the basics of society. At once, action must be taken to secure the position of sheep harvests, but it does not show signs of the budget. At once, counter measures must be made against the adverse toll agreements that recently took place and are a threat to domestic food production. It is difficult to dispose of funding counter measures in the budget set up the agriculture and the expected import of agricultural products and what to return. In such an important matter, disintegration of measures and contributions should be followed in the section on agriculture in the budgetary bill. I\'d like to move next only to the travel service, which is our largest industry and is facing a lot of uncertainty. The development of tourism is among the main uncertainty factors in terms of the budget. In recent years, the importance of tourism in gross domestic production has increased from 3.4% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2017. The contribution of tourism to the collection of currency is considerable. So watching this article has a significant impact on the economic leaders of the bill. The largest export of the country still has too much uncertainty. Interestingly, contributions to travel services reduce an absolute value of 292 billion. At a point, 12.8% from the 2019 budget. The article has grown rapidly over the past few years, but now it needs to deal with slower growth and even contractions. It is important to take this action by improving the current situation immediately, e.g. with a faster reduction in insurance costs. Although tourism lines have been clarified during the past few months, after the fall of WOWair, the uncertainty has not been lifted and the adaptation of tourism to the changed situation is not complete. Travel services are expected to have to cope with a very negative impact on the spread of Britain from the EU, as well as changes in economic prospects in the United States and China. Under such circumstances, the competitiveness of Icelandic tourism can be crucial. It\'s coming even. ... ina review of the Association of travel services by the bill. A financial program 20200/2024 shows that the planned changes in tourism will be made at the time of the programme, but it appears that the plans have been postponed and are happy to do so. It should be kept in mind that the planned tax system for tourists is very dangerous at this stage and in the down cycle and uncertainty of the article. This would inevitably have a direct bearing on the global competitiveness of the article. I encourage the government to come to the earth with caution as we reflect on the tax collection of this important article. Finally, Mr. President, I\'d like to give a special mention that the Central Party stresses the extra funding for customs, Narcotics and security on bordering up to 250 million. K. and I will conclude later in our discussion that we have a set of options of up to 525 million. K. An extra microchip. It is a two-fold increase in proposals to the labour agency to increase the number of jobs with support, an important option that has been sadly malused and I will discuss it more later, and in addition we are going to put up with the budget of micromotives and suggest an additional 325 billion. K. let\'s go up it. This is important for those who can work at a job to obtain a higher amount of provision. I see, Mr. President, that my time is over. There are some things I haven\'t come in on and I will try to introduce them later in this discussion.']","<|system|>

I am pleased that the interparliamentary work in our federal country on a transversal issue such as the climate, when I hear you, ladies and gentlemen, starts with great enthusiasm. What you see here are the so-called warming stripes. This shows in a very visual way how our climate has changed worldwide. The colours speak for themselves, since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the middle of the nineteenth century until about today and at all latitudes. With this, these warming strips move from the same to different degrees. A very aesthetically beautiful image that in reality is much less beautiful for many people on this planet. As you requested, Mr. President, I will try to report to you on COP 25, the 25th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, chaired by Chile, which was held in Madrid for the reasons you know. I immediately come to the door with a conclusion from that COP, a political conclusion, expressed by Mr António Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who is perhaps well-known to you, who has campaigned very actively for a whole year, in particular to bring the level of ambition of the parties, the Member States of the United Nations and the parties to the Paris Agreement into line with what the science states as necessary to keep within reach the one and a half degrees, the Paris Agreement\'s objective. Mr Guterres was disappointed and I think that the disappointment about the outcome of the COP was shared by many. It is not just about the lack of a strong common signal from the international community that everyone is willing to bring the national level of ambition into line with Paris, but also about the process itself. We have once counted how many of the very many agenda items led to decisions and conclusions at the Madrid meeting. On the chart you can see that more than half of the calendar items have remained unsolved. Some items were actively postponed, so nothing was decided at that time, but it was decided to continue talking about it. Other items were postponed because there was no possibility of that. That\'s the famous rule 16 you see on the chart. It concerns rule 16 of the rules or procedures of a COP. Of course, decisions were taken on various issues, not all of which are gloomy and tormentful. The two logos you see appear are from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 5, on gender, and 14 on water. Indeed, on gender, as planned, the so-called Lima Action Plan on Gender was strengthened and extended for another five years. In connection with water, oceans, the COP was announced by Chile long in advance as Blue COP, the COP where the links between the oceans, the seas and the climate would be central. Last year the IPCC had also published a special report on the relationship between climate, on the one hand, and oceans and cryosphere, on the other. There has been a proposal from a number of countries – Indonesia, Fiji, Costa Rica – to formally establish a process within the UNFCCC within the climate negotiations, a dialogue that should lead to recommendations to the next COP. The discussions on this subject would seem obvious, because the Ocean-Climate Nexus is there, in reality, and it should be there in politics too. Nevertheless, it has proved quite difficult to reach a decision, which is strictly procedural in nature, i.e. the organisation of a dialogue. However, we have succeeded – the COP has nevertheless succeeded in being a blue COP – with the organization of a dialogue at the next intersessional meeting in Bonn in June during SBSTA 52. The IPCC not only published last year a report on the links between oceans, cryosphere and climate, but also a report on climate change and land use, which was not on the agenda at this Blue COP. But there was a great deal of pressure from many countries – surprisingly, for example, from a country like Saudi Arabia, which normally does not recognize, or not with much enthusiasm, the work of the IPCC – for the COP to also take a decision on the relationship between land use and climate change. This has resulted in a decision that is parallel to the decision on the oceans, but that, unlike the decision on the oceans, is focused exclusively on adaptation to climate change in relation to land use. We have not only managed to make decisions on these two or three issues. Like all COPs, the topic of funding, including the topic of financing actions in developing countries, was a hot topic. This was no less the case at this COP. But after negotiations that have proved very difficult, as always, we have succeeded in adopting decisions that give ""guidance"" to the various financial instruments of the international climate regime: the Standing Committee on Finance, the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility. On the sidelines, not in the context of the negotiations, it is important to mention the COPs, which have become increasingly gatherings, not just negotiators and diplomats, but all the actors interested in climate change, which are numerous. Another important element is the adoption by a coalition of finance ministers, whose initiative was taken, if I remember Finland recently, of an action plan in relation to financing. And this – not decided by the COP – in the context of the (replenishment) replenishment of the Green Fund, which is now again funded by almost ten billion dollars, and to which many parties, including Belgium, as you know, have doubled their contribution. On other issues related to climate policy financing, however, we did not agree. This concerns, for example, the new long-term objective of our common objective of mobilising climate finance in developing countries. The successor to the 100 billion dollars we will have to mobilise by this year, a year, will be something for COP 26 in Glasgow. As always, themes are the balance between the financing of mitigation and adaptation and the share of proceedings or the way in which the carbon market can contribute to international climate financing, which is a very important and delicate issue. These are also very common issues such as the composition of the Management Committee, the Board of the Adaptation Fund and very geopolitical issues such as access to finance by the Global Environment Facility for countries such as Palestine and Iran, which some parties regard as rogue states. For the rest of the red zone, the undecided part of the agenda items, I will focus here on the elements of the Paris Agreement Rulebook. You will remember that after Paris we still had to take a large number of decisions to make Paris fully enforceable. A large number of implementing decisions had yet to be taken by COP, or indeed CMA, under the Paris Agreement. That should have been decided at COP 24, more than a year ago, in Katowice in Poland. This has been achieved in most cases, except for what the Paris agreement calls cooperative approaches, particularly as regards the international carbon market, and also for a number of outstanding issues relating to loss and damage and enhanced transparency framework, the new reporting and follow-up regime that Paris had created. Transparancy, to start with, is a very technical matter, but also a very crucial matter. If you cannot follow up on what the parties do under the Paris Agreement, then you cannot verify whether they comply with their commitments. Nor can we look at whether we are all moving in the direction of the Paris objectives together. Most of the decisions that had to be made could be made in Katowice. What remained for Madrid were some very technical matters, reporting tables in essence. It should have been possible, therefore, if it had not been possible, that although Paris had consolidated the existing bipolar system between the developed industrialized countries, on the one hand, and the developing countries, on the other hand, into one common base, there was still flexibility on the system. One has to take into account the fact that many developing countries have much more limited capacity, in terms of, among other things, statistical reporting systems, compared to industrialised countries and the larger, richer developing countries. In short, the question of how to avoid reintegrating the firewall, the separation between industrial and developing countries, with which Paris had largely been involved, into the regime was discussed again. We do not yet have an answer to that, because we have not got out of it. Some progress has been made on some aspects, but we have not even been able to decide on a work programme for the further work by 2020. With regard to loss and damage, there is a more political problem. Let me remind you that climate policy has three pillars. Firstly, mitigation, emission reduction and the prevention of climate change; the second pillar is adaptation, adaptation to the inevitable consequences of climate change; the third pillar is, since Paris is also explicitly, loss and damage, all beyond adaptation: the consequences of climate change that one cannot reasonably prepare for, for example, a storm that goes over a small island state and causes damage in the order of three quarters of gross domestic product, or a low-lying atoll that becomes uninhabitable due to the rising sea level. I will only give two extreme examples of what we are talking about here. With regard to loss and damage, a number of points were still open. As always, these were related to financial support for developing countries in dealing with loss and damage, and further strengthening of the institutions created for Paris, in view of the international mechanism for sustainable development. An expert group has been set up in Madrid for this purpose, which will continue to work on supporting actions in developing countries. The Santiagonetwork will promote cooperation between all organisations that are involved in loss and damage worldwide in one way or another. Then I come to governance, who\'s in charge of loss and damage? Is that the COP under Paris or is that the COP under the Treaty? We didn\'t agree on that. That seems very technical and mundane, but it is also very political. The issue with loss and damage is the threat that the recognition of loss and damage could lead to a regime of objective liability that could give victims a legal basis for making claims under international law to the historical causes of climate change. Those claims could be of such magnitude that these historical causes become extremely nervous. In Paris a sleeve could be adapted by including in the decision accompanying Paris a disclaimer stating that Article 8 which deals with loss and damage cannot be a legal basis for such claims in international law. If the regime that controls loss and damage is kept under Paris, then the danger of those claims is partly averted. Now, some, especially those developing countries that can be the biggest victims, want COP to be responsible for this too. The COP of the Convention does not have that disclaimer, the safety clause against damages claims, namely. That is why there was no agreement on whether the Warsaw International Mechanism belongs under Paris or under the COP of the Treaty. I\'ll come to the carbon market, cooperative approaches. You will recall that Article 6 of the Paris Agreement created two new market mechanisms as successors to the market mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol. There is also a mechanism that should allow for cooperation on a basis other than the market. I won\'t talk about those non-market approaches, that\'s what it\'s gonna do. I will talk about the development of the two new market mechanisms in the context of Articles 6, 2 and 6, 4 of the Paris Agreement. The problems with this are two-fold, in general terms. On the one hand, these markets need to be regulated in a way that allows them to contribute to raising the level of ambition and avoid creating loopholes, that they would further reduce the level of ambition contained in the NDCs submitted by the parties to the Paris Agreement. That is a question of environmental integrity. The robust rules, which we need for this, to avoid damaging environmental integrity, environmental integrity, are also needed to maintain a level playing field in the international carbon market. If you have weak rules at international level, I dare to assume that Europe, as we have done with Paris, will introduce stricter rules for the use of credits from the international carbon market. Ergo, an uneven playing field for European players in the international market. So the robust rules, necessary for environmental integrity, apply equally to ensuring, as far as possible, the level playing field for European players in the international carbon market. On the other hand, the question is how this international carbon market, as envisaged by the Kyoto Protocol and worked for a while, but no longer after that, can contribute to the financing of adaptation actions in developing countries. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement provides that, in part, ""share"" or ""procededs"" was therefore introduced, a kind of levy, if you like, of 2% under Kyoto, on CDM projects. That levy then benefited from the Adaptation Fund. Under Paris, it is foreseen that such a share of proceedings would also apply to the successor of the Clean Development Mechanism under the Paris Agreement. However, for the other mechanism to be created in accordance with Article 6, 2 of the Paris Agreement, such a share procedure is not provided for. I will first illustrate, graphically and quantitatively while remaining illustrative according to orders of magnitude, what could be the impact of bad rules of play for the carbon market on the level of ambition. This graph, I think you know it, shows the difference between on one side (green and yellow) the emission trajectories on which we should find ourselves by 2030 in order to be able to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement of 1.5°C or 2°C. The Blue Line represents the projected emissions that would result from the NDCs (nationally determined contributions), i.e. national actions under the Paris Agreement. As you can see, the gap between these two lines is already very large. I realize that the volumes mentioned in gigatons of CO2 equivalent are very abstract. What is more telling is that with this kind of deviation, we are not moving towards a world that would manage to limit the rise of temperature to 1°C, or even 2°C, but we are moving, according to Climate Analytics analysis, towards a world at 3°C above the pre-industrial level. This is the basis. If we find ourselves in a situation in which the various parties (the international community) to the Paris Agreement would not be able to close the potential loopholes in the regimes that manage the international carbon market, you can observe that there is a huge risk that this gap will become even greater. This graph shows only the first four potential problems for the environmental integrity of the carbon market under the Paris Agreement. The others are even more difficult to quantify and are not even included. This subject, as I said to you, was so controversial that we were unable to agree either in Katowice or in Madrid. Indeed, on the one hand, there was a coalition of countries very attached to the defence of this environmental integrity and the level playing fied that go hand in hand with, inter alia, a coalition that had already been launched at the pre-COP in San José, Costa Rica. This coalition has adopted a list of principles to serve as a basis for the carbon market. I\'m not going to list them. I assume, Mr. Chairman, that members of this dialogue will have access to the presentation. As I said, this coalition brings together a considerable number of countries, even if they were not the majority. In doing so, a large part of the countries of the European Union, including Belgium, have subscribed to these principles. I come back to these principles to illustrate three of the difficult issues that were discussed at this COP, related to the establishment of rules for the carbon market. First of all, there is the question, as I have already referred to, of the carbon market already existing under the Kyoto Protocol. There is also the question of credits, which could be transferred and which could still be transferred in the context of the Kyoto Protocol and which could be used under the new regime created by the Paris Agreement. Countries such as Brazil, but also the large Like-Minded Developing Countries coalition with very large countries such as China and India want to be able to use all of these credits. It should be noted that the market created by the Kyoto Protocol no longer exists. This market has collapsed because of the huge oversupply of worthless loans, in particular through the creation of non-additional CDM credits, but certainly also by hot air, the surplus of sign-demand units from the countries of the former Soviet Union and a number of Member States of the European Union. If those units were to be injected, it would be billions of tonnes of CO2 in the market bubble of the Paris Agreement, then the level of ambition of Paris would collapse. The same applies to double counting. I\'m not an accounting expert, but counting an amount twice looks like fraud. At the level of discussions on carbon market accounting rules in the Paris Agreement, there are countries that are in favour, without any inconvenience, of counting a tonne of CO2 reduced as if it were two tonnes: once for themselves and once for the country purchasing these credits. Brazil, the Like-Minded Developing Countries and a number of African countries do not want any obligation to carry out this accounting which should be used to avoid this double counting. On the other hand, we find the European Union and not a lot of other countries. However, this was not the case for the use of pre-2020 units, as the European Union has not been able to reach agreement since a number of Member States are in possession of such units and are committed to being able to use them after 2020. The Share of Processes, i.e. the carbon market\'s contribution to the financing of adaptation actions in developing countries, is also a subject that has divided the parties and contributed significantly to the disagreement over the part of the Paris Rulebook on Article 6. There was – and is rare – a great unity among the developing countries – united in the G77 Group and China – to demand such a Share of Processeds, not only in the context of Article 6.4 but also of Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. On the other hand, the industrialized countries oppose it. As I said, there is no agreement. Discussions continue not on one text but on three versions of the text attached to Bonn at the meetings of the subsidiary bodies of the agreement. I started with a quote from Mr Guterres and I believe that the fact that he was disappointed was less related to what I have just told you about the failure in terms of procedures on the Paris Rulebook than to the gap between the levels of ambition necessary to be able to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Given this context, I turn to the IPCC\'s analysis in 2018 regarding, in particular, the emission reductions needed to stay below 1.5°C of temperature increase, with a goal – if so called – rather the need to reduce global emissions to zero net around 2050. This translates into a 45 per cent reduction from 2010 levels, according to the trajectories compiled by the IPCC, by 2030, in ten years\' time. That\'s the challenge. There is therefore a gap. The fact that we were heading towards 3°C rather than around 1.5°C, or even 2°C, is not new. We did not have to wait for the IPCC report, or other analyses, to know that the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) from countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement were not going to be enough to stay below these temperature limits. It is for this reason that the Paris Agreement itself created what I continue to call ""a mechanism of ambition"" with, every five years, a global stocktake, that is, a collective assessment of the level of ambition compared with the necessary level of ambition. This started in 2018 and will follow a five-year cycle. This will be followed each time by the submission by the Paris Agreement parties of new CDNs, new objectives and new action plans, about two years after this collective evaluation. This will take place for the first time in 2020. Since 2017, the first phase of this cycle is being prepared. This will be the first time that the ambition mechanism will be started. At COP 23 in Bonn, under the chairmanship of Fiji, started what was called the Talanoa Dialogue. This was a process that was to lead, at COP 24 in Katowice, Poland, at the end of 2018, to a signal that could assure the parties to the Paris Agreement that each would contribute to increasing the level of ambition aimed at narrowing the gap between what was already decided at national level and what was needed at the level of the Paris objectives. This Dialogue took place in the same year as the publication of the IPCC report on 1.5°C – I refer to the chart I have just shown – but it did not lead to the result that we could have expected. I would like to give you a quote from the Polish Minister while Poland was presiding over the COP, who had already announced that he did not intend to conduct the discussions with the aim of increasing climate ambition. In 2019, a new dynamic was launched by UN Secretary-General António Guterres. He organized a United Nations Climate Action Summit in September, which you\'re probably aware of. He has been actively campaigning for a whole year to encourage countries to present action plans, nationally determined contributions in the Paris jargon, which are in line with what the IPCC says is necessary to keep 1.5 degrees in range, i.e. 45% by 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050. That was Mr Guterres\' ambition for his summit in New York on 23 September last year. He only managed to do so in part. The summit can be called a success, in the sense that many initiatives have been launched. A number of countries have promised to present more ambitious NDCs this year. A similar number of countries have announced their intention to work towards a policy of net zero emissions by 2050. If we sell the emissions that the countries represent against global emissions and the emission reductions that are needed, that will remain a drop in the ocean. The great exponents, the members of the G20, are for the most part not among them. COP 26 has not been able to change so much there. There are a number of countries that have also endorsed the Climate Ambition Alliance, but still not the big protesters. The COP in Madrid also had the ambition, again, episode 3 of the COP-series ambition, to give a political signal, a common signal from the international community that when countries start thinking about the NDCs they will have to present this year, they will take into account the gap that still exists between policies and objectives. They succeeded in doing so for a very small part. The Chile Madrid Time for Action, a decision under the Paris Agreement, repeats a great many of the things that had already been decided in Paris. The message that was already there remains and adds one element to it. That is the element of the gap and its concern. It is not just a matter of concern, but also of concern, and this is the first time that the explicit call for ""urges parties"" has been made in strong terms to take account of this gap when they will present new or updated and updated NDCs in 2020. The COP 26 will thus once again become a COP of ambition. It will be the first COP after we have seen all the NDCs and where one way or another a judgment will have to be made whether we are all on the right track together or not. So it\'s quite a package for COP 26. One could make the analysis that many of the things that could not be decided on in Madrid are many, remember one of my first graphs, namely the green-red doughnuts were things that one deliberately did not want to decide, precisely to keep the package of different decisions needed for COP 26 large and thus increase the number of levers in the negotiations. Mr Guterres was disappointed, but he did not give up, so he continued to take action at his level to persuade countries to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 and keep the 1.5 degree target within reach. I am going to the European level. It is a little early to be very specific about what we can expect from COP 26. The British colleagues, who we have seen for the last time at a European meeting on international climate policy earlier this month, have not yet really shown their sights, but what is clear is that there is a great deal to be done at European level, particularly in the context of the European Green Deal. I begin with a specific aspect of the European Green Deal, in which the European Union continues to profile itself as a leader in international negotiations in a very explicit way. This is continuity, but enhanced continuity, strengthening the role of international diplomacy with other international instruments at the disposal of the European Union. The bottom two bullets on the list are potentially two very powerful levers for the European Union to encourage other countries to take action: integrating respect for the Paris Agreement into trade agreements and the possibility of introducing a carbon adjustment mechanism in 2021. These are important levers that the European Union has unilaterally at its disposal to encourage other parties to take action on a global scale. The European Union also has a clear ambition to take on its leadership role in terms of example. We have been working for some time on the long-term strategy to be presented by all parties to the Paris Agreement by 2020. There is the proposal of the previous European Commission from 2018, Clean Planet For All, which aims to be climate neutral by 2050. This objective is now strongly supported by the European Commission\'s proposals for a European Green Deal. Not only at the level of the European Commission, but also at the level of the Member States and the European Council, clear signals have already been given, step by step. At the June 2019 European Council, it was decided that we are moving towards a climate-neutral Europe, but not yet that this should be by 2050, as the IPCC requires. At that time, four countries were still at odds. On 12 December 2019, at COP, all Member States, including the four I just showed you in red, agreed that the European Union would become climate neutral by 2050. There is one small caveat of Poland, of course. That\'s the one member state you see here. It is a quote from the conclusions of the European Council. Poland says very clearly that it supports the European objective of climate neutrality by 2050, but it cannot yet commit itself, in the current context and at this stage, to implementing it effectively at national level. This will be continued at a forthcoming European Council meeting in June 2020. That was the long-term objective, but there is also the short term. 2020 is the year in which we are presenting a new NDC. You are undoubtedly aware of the announced ambition of the European Commission, as contained in the Green Deal proposal to set European emissions for Horizon 2030 at 50% or perhaps 55%, whereas that is now 40%. No decisions have yet been taken on this at Council level and at the meeting of the Member States of the European Union. Last year, 10 Member States announced at the New York Summit that they are working at national level to raise the level of ambition. This is already a step in the direction that the debate between the Member States will take on that aspect of the Green Deal. I will show you here a small part of the resolution adopted by the European Parliament for COP 25. In fact, they had already decided something similar in the COP 24 resolution. They are in favour of an emission reduction of 55% in the territory of the European Union, domestic greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. without using the carbon market. Of course, this is linked to the call for other countries to also increase their level of ambition. It is not unimportant that this resolution could count on a large majority in the European Parliament. It was carried by the largest political groups in that parliament. I\'m gonna go a little deeper on the Green Deal. That\'s 25 pages with a few more pages of appendages. Nevertheless, it is not a climate or energy strategy, in the words of Mrs von der Leyen herself it is the European Union\'s new growth strategy. It uses terms that I have never heard a President of the Commission speak before, things like regenerative economy and giving back to the planet more than we take away. That is the narrative of the Von der Leyen Commission. That Green Deal is really becoming the heart of European core policy. For example, if we look at the European Union\'s macro-economic policy and adjust what Member States are doing in the context of the European Semester, we can see that the annual growth strategy ""the kick-off of the annual cycle of the European Semester\' states that economic growth is not an end in itself. This is the very first sentence of the new annual growth strategy proposed by the Commission. The paradigmashift of a new model of growth is repeated. Sustainability as a core and not as a peripheral element. This illustrates the fact that the new European Commission really puts sustainability in all its aspects at the heart of all its policies. This Green Deal is not a climate plan, it is not an environmental plan, it is a new growth strategy and it affects the whole of European policy and, indirectly, the policies of the Member States. That Green Deal aims to fundamentally transform our economy in a way that is social. As Mrs von der Leyen herself says, that Green Deal has to work for everyone or he won\'t work. This is true both at the level of the different circumstances of different Member States of the European Union, but also in terms of different population groups within those Member States. Of course, the large blocks of initiatives include climate ambition, climate neutrality, 50% and 55%. Inevitably, therefore, there is also a great deal about energy, industry and the reform of European industry is very central to the building park and its renovation. But beyond that, in the broader environmental and health policy, with issues that are very closely related to climate and energy, there is the ambition to move towards a toxic free environment, the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity, the reform of agricultural policy as a function of it, and of course mobility as well. All this is supported by a rather robust package of financial measures and by that frameworking condition of a just transition, a just transformation and transition of our economy to ensure that no one is left behind. Not unimportant to mention here too, it is a bit in the margins, is that the European Commission does not want to do so alone from its own angle. It also wants to do so in cooperation with the Member States, which it obviously cannot do otherwise. She wants to do the same with the citizens, with the stakeholders. A European climate pact is announced in terms of governance of this Green Deal. That\'s gonna be real soon. A number of points in the Green Deal communication are more directly related to the European climate ambition and are therefore partly the political message in the run-up to COP 26 that Europe sets a good example. I\'ll give you a little more detail on that. Under the heading climate of the Green Deal, as early as March 2020, a legislative proposal from the European Commission to make the objective of climate neutralisation by 2050, which has now been politically validated by the European Council, legally binding. By the summer of 2020, the European Commission was expected to present a proposal on how to increase the level of ambition at Horizon 2030. It will be tight to have that proposal counted as a political signal in the run-up to COP 26. Hopefully, the preparatory work, the intention of the European Commission and the reception of the communication by the Member States and the European Parliament can also count as a political signal and thus encourage other parties to take serious action to increase their level of ambition. Linked to this and depending on what the 2030 plan aims to increase the level of ambition, in 2021 the whole package of climate and energy legislation will be designed to deliver emissions trading, efficiency sharing, renewable energy, energy efficiency, CO2 standards for passenger cars, vans and trucks, to effectively implement European legislation at European level and the obligations for European Member States on the said 50-55 % targets. I have already mentioned the carbon border adjustment mechanism as an alternative to what is already contained in the ETS on the protection of our companies\' competitiveness vis-à-vis companies operating in countries where lower carbon prices and less ambitious climate policies apply. I have already spoken about the revision of the directive on renewable energy and energy efficiency, but there will also be a strategy for the further roll-out of offshore winds and the interconnection of electricity networks. There will be an initiative for the renovation of buildings, with the aim of doubling the degree of renovation. An industrial strategy will also be coming very soon, in March. A new action plan for the circular economy is linked to this, because these things are very closely linked. There are a number of sectors explicitly mentioned by the Commission in its Communication in terms of a sustainable industrial strategy: a steel initiative, a battery initiative in the context of the circular economy, for example. In the context of steel, the objective is to have a carbon-neutral steel production sector by 2030. As far as mobility is concerned, this is the following. I was talking about emission standards for passenger cars, trucks and vans. Among other things, it concerns the possibility of extending the emissions trading system to the shipping sector, to make the aviation sector\'s participation in the EU ETS less non-binding and to give less free allowances to those sectors. A number of very concrete proposals are being announced here. The two bases, the rather much defining underlying conditions for the success of the European Green Deal, are the funding, on the one hand, and the inclusive character, the justice or fairness of the transition, on the other. In this context, we have received a proposal from the Commission, in particular on a just transition mechanism, which bridges the two pillars of financing and equity. More broadly, there is a new investment plan for a sustainable Europe. We will also see Commission proposals in relation to national budgets and the use of state aid in the context of the Green Deal. The Commission has announced that it believes that it will be able to invest, with the various measures it proposes in the financial context of the Green Deal, a thousand billion euros over the next ten years. These billions come not only from the European budget, but also from national budgets, the private sector, etc. On the screen, you see the concept of this investment plan, with more or less half a billion euros from the European budget. It is not yet decided in the multiannual financial framework, but I have just read that the President of the Council Charles Michel has announced that he will try to reach agreement on this multiannual financial framework on 20 February. There is also the use of the various instruments, the main one of which is called InvestEU – which is the successor of the Juncker plan – depending on the funding needed for the success of the Green Deal. As far as the transition mechanism is concerned, it contains a new Fair Transition Fund which should be able to mobilise EUR 30 to 50 billion in the most vulnerable countries and which have the most difficulty in achieving the low-carbon transition. These are countries that rely heavily on the use of coal – for example Poland – or have a large concentration of carbon-emitting industries. It\'s not just that fund. There is also the new Juncker plan (InvestEU programme) which will dedicate money which would also lead to the mobilization of a comparable amount (45 billion dollars). There are also the actions of the European Investment Bank which – Mrs von der Leyen had already announced in her policy guidelines – should become the European Climate Bank which could generate 25 to 30 billion investments. These resources will not be given to Member States or regions in need. Funding is conditional on the submission of a territorial (territorial transition plan) plan, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the requirement for co-financing at national level. With this, in the Commission\'s proposal, the Member States of the European Union could count on a mobilizable amount of money (consultable in the last column of this small table). As far as Belgium is concerned, it would potentially be entitled to EUR 68 million from the Fair Transition Fund. But with the different levers contained in the rest of the package and the need to co-finance with national money, Belgium could mobilise almost one billion euros for the ""just transition"". The European Council has not yet spoken on the Commission\'s proposals. Parliament, on the other hand, adopted a general resolution on the Green Deal on 15 January. It is a resolution which, in a very general way, very much welcomes the Commission\'s proposals. I would like to show you the first paragraph in which the Commission welcomes the communication, shares the committee committees, a resolution which has been approved by a large majority of the Members of the European Parliament and has been carried by the various political groups in the European Parliament. We must now see how the Council will position itself. The Commission has, as it always does, sent its communication on the Green Deal to the European Parliament, but also to the Council of the European Union. As I said, the Council has not yet spoken. Exchanges of views are planned, etc. But there are no conclusions yet. What we have done is to see which members of the European Parliament are members of political parties that are part of the national governments of the Member States. As you can see, a large majority of the parties present in governments at national level, most of the members of these parties, in the European Parliament, voted in favour of this resolution, with the notable exception, to the right, of Poland. Almost all the Members of the European Parliament who are members of the ruling parties in Poland voted against this resolution. However, this gives an indication of the potential political support of the Member States within the Council. It is also useful to look at... The Green Deal itself will not be voted on; it will be potentially welcomed, with Council conclusions that are adopted by consensus. However, if we look at the Roadmap, the list of fifty actions for 2050, as Mrs von der Leyen calls it, there are many proposals that are legislative in nature. For most of the topics dealt with, the Council is voted on and qualified majority voting is the rule. For information, a legislative proposal is accepted in the Council if the Member States voting in favour represent 65% of the European population – represented here by the orange line on the charts. The small orange dots are the population of each country. As you can see, with the countries with a majority of political parties that voted in favour of the Green Deal in the European Parliament, we are just going beyond the 65 % condition to reach a qualified majority. In particular, according to this analysis, Belgium would achieve this majority. This is obviously only an indication. To be seen in the various elements... The various amendments could not be analysed on all the specific points of the Green Deal, but this nevertheless gives an indication of the political will present within the national majorities of the Member States of the European Union. Mr President, I will end my speech with a small point about the role of Belgium, not just as a European Member State in the wider context of the discussions on the Green Deal. I would also like to point out that it will be a real task to ensure that all the filières and all the levels of policy across all the different aspects of the new growth strategy can achieve united positions in an inclusive and transparent way. I am talking about this because Belgium, like the European Union, will have to present a long-term strategy in 2050 in the context of the Paris Agreement. Article 15 of the Energy Union Governance Regulation also obliges a Member State of the European Union to submit a long-term strategy to the European Commission. We should have done so by 1 January 2020. However, that has not yet been achieved. You can see the timeline below. I also briefly describe the methodology, because, Mr President, you also mentioned that cooperation and dialogue are at the heart of the discussions that are currently taking place. The methodology decided by the four governments concerned, the three regional governments and the federal government, in order to establish a long-term strategy is a methodology similar to the methodology used for the National Energy and Climate Plan. Each ""identity"" ""the federal state"" is of course not a federated entity, but that term is used ""the Federal State"" develops its own strategy. The various strategies will eventually be linked. This is the methodology decided in April 2019. The three Regions, Brussels, Wallonia and the Flemish Region, adopted their regional strategies in November and December 2019. The federal government hasn\'t adopted a strategy. The document included in the discussions is a vision document developed by the administration. Discussions between the Ministerial Policy Cells and the Cabinets with a view to a decision or validation of a text by the Consultation Committee at the end of February 2020 are about to end. That text would look like the following. First, the three regional strategies, as approved by the regional governments; a kind of overarching text, a summary where possible, with the literal text of the three regional strategies annexed to that text. Then, at best, as some kind of contextual element, the federal vision document, actually the federal administration vision document. It seems that Belgium will have fulfilled its formal obligation to impose a long-term strategy on the European Commission within a reasonable time, even after the deadline. I believe that the real challenge lies in the further roll-out of this long-term strategy. At best, such a long-term strategy provides clear objectives and a number of orientations, as well as the federal vision document. It indicates where the yards can be located. Of course, this strategy can only become a policy if it is further developed. In particular, this should be done in the form of a participatory process with all actors in society, also on the basis of the intention of regional strategies. Mr President, so far my speech has been made. Thank you for your attention and I am happy to answer questions.', ""Thank you, Vice President Yevdzic. Dear Minister with associates, colleagues and fellow MPs, I don't think there are any or very few of those who don't see that the last few decades of the Earth's planet face ever more pronounced climate change. They are not only a plague of nature, and the impact of man on climate change is evident, or human negligence that contributes to their acceleration, so there is a great responsibility on us. This is why two basic guidelines - reducing greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming and adaptation. adapting to climate change that is our reality. The result of climate change is no longer an abstract phenomenon that is spoken of when other topics run out, they are tangible and can be seen with a naked eye and we witness almost daily and the consequences of them and they live and there is no country in the world that is spared. That the climate on the planet Earth has changed compared to what it looked like in the mid-20th century, shows us the flash floods that happened to Serbia in 2014, droughts that decimate the crop of agricultural cultures. We have a much lighter winter than just a few decades ago, a warmer summer with much more heat waves, then a more frequent and extreme amount of rainfall in some parts of the world in which the rains were not a characteristic phenomenon, droughts in the Middle East the most difficult in the last 1,000 years, snow in Spain and weather during this winter that hasn't been recorded since the 1970s. The reason for climate change is to increase the concentration of greenhouse gases, in the first place carbon dioxide, and because of the use of fossil fuels as primary sources of energy. Climate change directly reflects people's lives, people's health, their safety, their economic progress, and if you want to invest. Perhaps even a greater threat to mankind's terrorism. They affect the quality of the air, even many of our cities are very often at the top of a list of pollution, water quality, we are approaching the moment when the need for water will exceed the supply, after which the fight for health begins drinking water. Because of the growing droughts, climate change threatens agriculture, floods, storms, fires destroy infrastructure. If climate change didn't stop, it also showed us in 2020, when the pandemics of the coronal virus made the whole world stop, only climate change happened at an unaltered rate in the way scientists have warned us for years. We remember the terrible forest fires in Australia when over 10 million acres of forest burned down, thousands of buildings destroyed, and more than half a billion animals died. In addition to Australia, the fires struck Siberia, then the Amazon, the western coast of the United States, then the catastrophic floods in Vietnam, the devastating tropical storms in Central and North America, as a result of the warming of our planet, which scientists have been warning for years. It remains to be seen whether the hottest year of 2020 will ever be measured, but what certainly marked it is record-high temperatures measured in the Arctic. Climate change at global level is expected to be increasingly significant and adaptation to climate conditions is expected. the adaptation is possible only in the event of reaching the main objective of the Paris Agreement, i.e. the limit of medium global temperature growth to two degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century with a tendency to reach 1.5 degrees already over the next 10 years. This indicates that it is necessary for all countries to unite in the fight against climate change and to contribute to their slowdown by their actions. After all, this was committed five years ago by all the states of the Paris Agreement's signatories. The governments of the signatories countries will have to come up with clear targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the next World Climate Summit. The United Nations warns that it is necessary for all countries to make additional efforts to reduce global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 by 45% compared to 2010. Serbia has made a promise that it is ready to improve the results more than three times by 2030 so that, with additional support, it can improve even more than five times. In addition to improving energy efficiency and using a larger share of renewable energy sources in electricity production, heating of households and transport. We need to consider the fact that coal is our primary energy and that 70% of our electricity is produced in thermal power plants. So we need to gradually move on to renewable energy sources, such as the sun, wind, even hydro energy, making sure we don't destroy the plant and animal world, because then we didn't get anywhere. The fundamentals of the fight against climate change are the laws that regulate this area, as well as their consistent implementation. These days, when Serbia adopts its Climate Change Act, the French government has presented to citizens a proposal for climate legislation that should introduce ecology into all areas of public life, schools, public services, justice, urbanism, traffic. The law aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. As well as a large number of countries that align their way of development with reducing the impact on climate change, Serbia will set up a system for reducing emissions of harmful gases, as well as a programme for adapting to changed climate conditions. The law also implies preparing a domestic economy that will have to be adapted very quickly to a new type of emission limit for harmful gas to be competitive on the international market. What's important is that all sectors are adapting and you, Minister, have explained here how this will work. From the EU candidate position, but also because of a large share of exports to EU countries, Serbia must take care that the EU's objective is to achieve climate neutrality at the latest in 2050. This is important for us because the EU is preparing measures to limit absolute emissions through imports from other countries, announcing a tax or CO2 tax by 2023 on imports of steel, cement, chemicals and artificial fertilisers based on coal. The bill stipulates that large plants will have to be allowed to release CO2 into the atmosphere. Without these permits, they will not be able to start work, and the issue of permits is subject to existing facilities. It should be borne in mind that this law will not solve all the problems that bring climate change, and it is unrealistic to expect. Law-making is just the beginning of a fight to reduce the negative impacts that cause climate change. Our society and economy must adapt to a new reality, i.e. to adapt to changing climate conditions. For example, when it comes to rainfall, we need to look at projections for the future that point to an ever-increasing occurrence of heavy rainfall. increasing their intensity as a result of global warming. Therefore, it is not enough to restore dams made by some standards 50 years ago, but we must also take into account new data and projections and therefore plan and build flood defense systems. Minister, I don't know if you're familiar with this, but I have another problem here, and that's an uncontrollable cutting of the forest. deforestation without permission and without any order or plan. This is what happens to us both in Vojvodina and in Shumadia and in all parts of the country. This tree mostly ends up being a warm-up in individual sheds that are in line with the largest air pollutants. Science says that forests are being restored by screening, and I support it, but prodding is not a devastation behind which they remain naked as an ideal ground for streams that can, in short, lead to the spilling of riverbeds and thus endanger entire settlements and cities. One of the ways in which these consequences are mitigated are more severe punishments and controls, as well as shaming. On this occasion, I would like to remind you that it is very important that, after the adoption of the law, we immediately start to create national and local adaptation plans for climate change, because the forecasts are that floods, slides, droughts, fires, extreme weather disasters that local communities in Serbia face over the past decade will become even more intense in the years to come. The adaptation measures to climate change are essential because they preserve human lives, private property and public infrastructure. These measures would reduce the cost of recovery and allow smart planning in the economy and agriculture in line with the UN's sustainable development objectives, which in the future will affect both competition between local communities in attracting foreign investment and the countries themselves and have a positive impact not only on the environment, but also on reducing poverty and inequality. Our responsibility is to prepare ourselves for new events by adopting regulatory policies that will allow us to act more quickly and more easily both in the direction of emission reductions and in the direction of adaptation to climate change. That's why we're going to need more professional personnel, more field inspectors, and we need to pay special attention to capacity building, both at national and local level. In view of the above, not only is the adoption of the Climate Change Act important, but it is necessary to adopt all sublaws and strategic acts provided for in this law within the deadline provided for. The Green Parliamentary Group, which makes up a large number of lawmakers interested in environmental and environmental issues, will monitor further processes to produce and adopt all sublegal acts that follow this law and give full support to Serbia's transformation into a low-carbon environmental society. We have also submitted amendments that, we believe, could improve some parts of the law and we will discuss them in particular. The SDPS parliamentary group will strongly support this bill in voting day. Thank you."", 'Thank you very much, Mr. President. Dear Parliament, Today\'s political debate is very topical, as action on climate protection has reached four levels. Following the Paris agreement adopted in 2015, events accelerated and, as a result, we have reached the stage of finalising and implementing programmes and plans which are both international, EU and domesticly challenging. During the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the latest meeting of the Parties is taking place just days in Katowice, Poland, where countries are conducting intensive negotiations to adopt the detailed rules of the Paris Agreement, namely the work programme for implementing the Paris Agreement. [[14.20]] The EU Presidency is also making great efforts at these moments to establish this work programme. The agreed Paris Agreement, which replaces the Kyoto Protocol with a system of commitments for developed countries only, provides an appropriate framework for the management of international climate policy after 2020 and thus for the implementation of EU climate protection measures. On 31 October, the Parliament adopted the second national climate change strategy for the period 2018-2030, which also provides an outlook for the period up to 2050. On the basis of the Parliamentary Decision on the Second National Climate Change Strategy, we will have to and will draw up an Action Plan on Climate Change within six months and every three years thereafter. Finally, our energy use is responsible for three quarters of our greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. It is therefore inevitable that our climate policy should focus on a climate-conscious energy policy. In parallel with the development of the climate action plan, we are working on the Government\'s decision to review the current national energy strategy and to finalise the integrated national energy and climate plan next year in line with our EU obligations. It therefore appears that at all levels, at international and domestic level, the time has come to finalise and act on climate plans for the coming decades. In order to promote the finalization and successful implementation of Hungarian ideas next year, I would like to ask for your effective assistance and cooperation in advance. Dear Parliament, At the beginning of today\'s debate, it is worth noting that according to the most recent evaluation reports, only six players are responsible for more than 70 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions from climate change, namely China, the United States of America, 28 Member States of the European Union, India, Russia and Japan. In particular, China and the United States alone account for more than 40 percent of world emissions. Hungary accounts for about 0.13 percent of world emissions and only about 1.2 percent of EU emissions. There is a legitimate question as to why, despite our relatively small contribution to the problem of climate change, this issue should be dealt with in particular here in the Hungarian Parliament, and action on climate change should also be a fundamental issue for our future at home. The answer is summarised in the following five points, which set out the basics of our climate change policy. Firstly, scientific analysis suggests that climate change is taking place faster than we thought, and its negative effects are particularly serious for our country. Therefore, in the area of climate protection, we believe that we should prevent the avoidance, but also prepare for the inevitable, that is to say, in addition to the efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we must give priority to strengthening our capacity to adapt to climate change and to shaping our approach to this. Secondly, many people raise the opposite of economic growth and climate protection, implying that the latter is drawing resources from the economy unnecessarily. We\'re looking at it the other way. Climate change forces most countries around the world to act quickly, including in-depth transformation of energy supply, transport, water, forest and agriculture. It is a huge and growing market and business opportunity for all the economies and businesses that will offer the most competitive solutions to these needs. Hungary should belong to this group, because it has all the potential to do so, and therefore our economic growth, which is increasingly dependent on dynamic and qualitative innovation, can be a strong support for exploring and exploiting the innovation and business opportunities of climate-friendly restructuring of the economy. We call this a championship field. At the same time, economic development must be achieved in a sustainable manner in line with the climate protection requirement, and Hungary plans to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, in full compliance with the European Union\'s commitment to maintain dynamic economic growth compared to the 1990 base. On the basis of the above, the focus of our emission reduction measures is on measures to support energy security and innovation, which offer other social benefits in addition to climate protection, with a particular focus on the sustainable reduction of overhead costs. Therefore, the backbone of government measures is to promote all forms of energy saving, including rationalising the use of energy in buildings, increasing renewable energy use, greening of transport and the use of nuclear energy. We consider it a realistic goal to increase the share of renewable energy sources in our energy use by 2030 from the current 14 percent to 20 percent. Measures to strengthen our capacity to adapt to the negative effects of climate change are aimed at those points where Hungary is most sensitive to climate change. These are the protection of our waters and agricultural land, the mitigation of the negative effects of climate change on human health and the enhancement of the resilience of critical infrastructure services to extreme climatic phenomena. Finally, we stress that, while the government has a high responsibility for protecting our climate, climate protection is the most basically our common concern: local governments, businesses, local religious and civil communities, environmental protection and nature conservation organisations, educational institutions, families and every single Hungarian citizen must take part in this joint issue. Only in the case of close cooperation do we have a chance of joint success in the area of climate protection. Dear Parliament, Let us now look at Hungary\'s situation. It is important that we are all aware of the current climate picture and outlook in Hungary, and allow me to inform you about the government\'s initiative to support scientific cooperation. In Hungary, the 1.15 degrees Celsius national temperature increase since the beginning of the last century exceeds the estimated global change of 0.9 degrees Celsius. The average temperature in Hungary will increase beyond any doubt in the future, until the middle of the century we can expect a change of 1.4-2,6 degrees in summer and 1.6-2 degrees in autumn, while by the end of the century growth may be close to autumn and may exceed 4 degrees in summer. In order to enable our country to adapt to the inevitable and avoid the avoidance, the Hungarian government plans to draw up a national report focusing on Hungary, based on the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on global climate change, the first occasion of which was retained in the Ministry of Innovation and Technology. Dear Parliament, The situation in Hungary is favourable for greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. Compared to 1990, domestic emissions decreased by 34 percent, and climate protection efforts played a prominent role in the decline in addition to economic activity. The emissions per capita of around 6 tonnes for Hungary are lower than the European average over 8 tonnes/person. Between 2008 and 2009, our emissions decreased by nearly 9 percent, then in the next five years, between 2009 and 13 they remained at not only low levels, but they showed a further 12 percent decrease. Although the downward trend in emissions was interrupted in 14 and we were already able to register a 5 per cent increase in 15 and, albeit to a lesser extent, growth continued in 2016, in recent years emissions have increased in close association with rising economic growth, thus as a result of growth. [[14.30]] At the same time, it is important to note that the misconception that there is necessarily a conflict between economic growth and decarbonisation has proved to be unfounded in Hungary; while GDP grew by 59 percent in Hungary between 1995 and 2016, greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 19 percent during the same period. A number of government measures have contributed to the development of a positive overall picture. The government promotes national electromobility and energy efficiency programmes from Member States\' quota revenues through the popular programmes of the green investment system, the green economy financing system and the economic greening system; in sectors outside the emission trading sector such as transport, waste management, agriculture and built environments, Hungary is a high priority among the Member States of the European Union with its outstanding emission reduction results. Although it could have increased its emissions by 10% by 2020 based on its target, it is expected that it will be able to achieve at least the same reduction. Our country is currently at minus 13 per cent compared to the base year 2005 based on the inventory data available in 2016. The main contribution to reducing emissions was the change in the energy consumption of the building stock, where emissions fell by around 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent between 2005 and 2016. This is a greenhouse gas emission of an equivalent magnitude to the annual emissions of the Mátra Power Plant, corresponding to a 32 per cent reduction. Overall, household fuel consumption, which also depended on weather developments, decreased by around 11-13 percent during this period. Gas consumption decreased even more drastically by 42 percent between 2005 and 2014, while the use of firewood and other biomass doubled at the same time. These positive developments have been significantly contributed by grants for the energy modernisation of public institutions, which exceed a hundred billion forints, as well as programmes to support the building energy and equipment exchange of the ""Hot Home"" programme. Allow me to briefly summarise the major climate policy results achieved since 2010 following the presentation of emissions data, as climate regulation and implementation in Hungary have undergone a number of positive changes in recent years. The Parliament announced the Paris Agreement adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by Act L of 2016. Hungary has been involved in international climate finance since 2010 and is a member of the Steering Committee of the Global Environment Facility, a UN environmental programme implementation unit. The Kigali amendment of the Montreal Protocol can facilitate the uptake of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient technologies, and Hungary is the first to conclude the internal ratification process in the European Union and in the world. Within the framework of the Environmental and Energy Efficiency Operational Programme, climate strategies have been developed in the county of 19 counties, as well as the climate strategy of Budapest, which serves as the basis for the necessary improvements at the level. In addition, a broad target group of county climate change platforms and a capital climate change platform have been established. Local, regional and national climate change strategies and decision-making, as well as the necessary measures, will be supported by the National Adaptation Space Information System, which was developed in 2012 with a legislative and conceptual basis, and the operational system will be available from 2016. In addition to the CCP, it was also possible to develop sustainable energy and climate action plans for rural development communities with urban and local development strategies in operational programmes for territorial and urban development. I would like to point out that on 12 September 2018, the Association of County-righted Cities bringing together 23 Hungarian rural cities joined the so-called Under2, or 2 degrees Celsius climate protection coalition. The members of the International Climate Protection Alliance undertake to reduce their greenhouse CO2 emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared to 1990s. By 2023, the members of the association will carry out investments and upgrades for climate protection of around HUF 100 billion. Finally, once again, the Hungarian Parliament recently adopted the fully Paris-compatible second national climate strategy. Dear Parliament, Of course, NÉS II. It is also integral to the wider energy and climate policy ideas of the government that we want to provide clean, smart and affordable energy to all Hungarian energy consumers. It is clear because it increases the weight of low or zero emission technologies in domestic energy use, encourages energy efficiency and thus strengthens our energy independence. It supports energy-saving solutions at all levels of the value chain to minimise negative impacts on the environment, climate and consumers\' energy expenditure. It is smart because it builds on the latest technological achievements in order to ensure a high level of energy services at the lowest possible cost. During the transformation of the energy sector, we aim to create new market opportunities for innovative domestic businesses and strengthen research and development activities in the sector. Finally, our energy strategy is one that provides affordable services, because we are developing a diversified supply portfolio and a regulatory environment in which domestic energy developments support the competitiveness of the Hungarian economy in a sustainable way and increase consumer welfare. In order to achieve this vision, we aim to implement the following four programme points: on the one hand, we place the Hungarian consumer in the focus of the national energy strategy, on the other hand, we strengthen the security of our energy supply, on the third, we implement climate-friendly transformation of the energy sector and take advantage of the economic development potential of energy innovation and climate change. Dear Parliament, Balance of prevention, adaptation and awareness-forming in climate protection; design based on the results of science; emission reduction policy conducive to innovative economic development; guaranteeing clean, smart, affordable energy for Hungarian consumers; inclusiveness and cooperation in planning and implementation we offer you and Hungarian citizens this vision in the field of integrated energy and climate policy. In the design and implementation of domestic climate change measures, the countdown has started, and we have to fight together in a battle that if we lose, all our other battles and struggles will be lost. Reducing the expected social impact of climate change and improving the adaptability of society is now our daily task, the efforts to slow down climate change and to adapt to changed circumstances can be effective if measures are surrounded by professional, scientific, policy and social consensus. This can only be achieved through common thinking and effort. That should be the case and I hope that today\'s debate will be about this. Thank you very much for your attention.

Honourable Members of the Riigikogu! I\'m honored to be here in this format for the first time. I\'m sure you\'re not getting as comprehensive and as good a report from Marko, but that\'s the way the task was assigned to me. I\'ll try to focus my thoughts on a much narrower section and explain it to you. After the round of questions and answers, of course, you can ask me all the questions, not just from the subject of the report. However, as a preliminary point, I would like to say a few words about the energy market as a whole and explain this so-called crisis or price shock. It seems to me that it is often forgotten that this balance, which Marko also spoke about, is sometimes called a trilemma, i.e. security, the environment and affordability, are very important components in the resolution of this energy economy [problems]. And if this balance is kept every hour, every minute, in the context of the electricity system, you could almost say that it is not kept every second, then these things happen that the balance between demand and supply disappears. Especially if it is dependent on weather when we talk about the future of renewable energy. Keeping this balance in mind at all times when all strategic decisions are taken, checking all the time whether this sort of checkes out these issues only in such a way that it is possible to solve energy issues and in any way knowingly try to prevent, avoid or get into an energy crisis, such as today\'s war, to ensure that its consequences are as low as possible. I suggest that, if there is an interest in learning about the so-called entrepreneurs\' view of possible scenarios for the future, look up this is a free-to-air ""Energy Roadmap."" This is the title of the analysis, and this analysis is the result of input and disputes provided by a very large number of energy companies at the Tallinn University of Technology, led by Rohetigr. Why do I think it\'s a sign report, a sign analysis? In it, practitioners working today have tried to anticipate how the energy turn, how this green turn could be foreseen in the Estonian context. The value of the analysis is that it is a compromise or a symbiosis about how entrepreneurs and practitioners, scientists and, let\'s say, in a good way, greening agents seem to be what is done and achievable in Estonia. I really think it\'s worth a lot, because if someone comes and says there\'s more to it than what\'s going to be done there in 2030, 2040. In the context of climate neutrality and the energy revolution, it has been said that the poison can be taken by the time it is not a good expression from this remote control, and I apologise, but then it can be relatively convinced that at least the current Estonian Energy companies do not know how to achieve this greater goal. Then somebody\'s gonna have to come up and tell them how to do it. And this is a picture, one of the most important images of this road map, which tells us that energy consumption in transport is currently 9.5 terawatt-hours, 14.4% in the heating economy and 7.7 in the electrical system. [[Display the slide.]] And as we can see from here, energy consumption is decreasing. The only one where energy consumption does not decrease, remains almost unchanged, or there is a very small increase, is electricity. This decline is taking place both in the heat economy and in transport. Why is it marked? It is symbolic in the sense that, in principle, this position says that a greening can only be carried out if we achieve a reduction in energy consumption. As energy consumption increases, these objectives are not achievable. Why am I talking about this? I am talking about this because these trends, which would allow energy consumption to be reduced, are also very important in the adoption of decisions in a crisis situation. In essence, it can be said that the whole of Europe, as well as Estonia, are in a certain sense at a crossroads: either to speed up the energy turn or to return to the secure and tried solutions that have always helped us in terms of energy[in supply], but in fact, from the point of view of climate objectives, they will take us back. And this is a very difficult place to choose. In one case, we are saying that it is coal, it is oil, it is oil in the Estonian context, we know how they work, we know how they guarantee energy security and so on, but they certainly take us beyond the climate goals. And I think it\'s maybe the most difficult place to make a decision. There is much talk about how renewable energy and fuel-free energy production in 2030, 2035 or 2040 could protect us from the price shocks of energy crises. I totally agree. The real question is how to get there. How can we achieve that, for example, in 2035, we are in this mix of energy production or energy sources, which is climate-neutral on the one hand and affordable on the other, and on the other hand is energy security on the other? I think that balancing these issues is the task of juggling which Marko, a honourable member of the Riigikogu, has set up in offering a portfolio of the Minister for Economic Affairs. And it won\'t be an easy task to keep this balance, because there\'s a lot of unpopular decisions to make. Especially in this situation where we know that today we are increasingly dependent on imported electricity when talking about electrification, as has already been said here. Our national electricity generation is still very much fossil. I would like to draw one more attention to all of you. When we are talking about resolving the crisis now, we often hear it, I am moving towards LNG, as I was asked, so that the easiest way to stop using gas is to switch to other sources. If we now think again in the key to green turn or climate neutrality, the sources that are called could be roughly said to be two in the short term. One is electrification. So mostly heat pumps, when we\'re talking about heat production, where the gas is in use, and the other is biomass. It\'s more like in this toolbox that we\'re moving towards a green turn or climate neutrality, there\'s no good dicks. There\'s another very important component, it\'s a recording, but we all realize that it\'s not fast or cheap [solution], it\'s a recording of hydrogen, it\'s a recording of [accumulation] or it\'s a solution of hydropump accumulation or some kind of fourth or fifth technology in the future. Recording for fast, 2030 or 2035 will not offer us a solution. Now, if we\'re thinking about electrification and biomass, this is the slide right here to characterize the electrification. We are saying that gas consumption in Estonia has always been on a downward trend and is there between 4 to 5 terawatt-hours, so it seems that of the 32 sharp-hours that are consumed in Estonia, this is not such an important part and we will cancel it. But when we think about which fuel the gas is, what it is used for and for which it will be used more and more in the future, [it is clear] that it [is not used] to cover the base load, i.e. not the basic energy consumption, but only in those places where the load needs to be increased or lowered very quickly. These are rapidly regulated power generation capacities. The food industry, agriculture, the chemical industry, the machinery industry in Estonia are around 3000 companies who use gas as inputs. And that\'s what, roughly, four sharp-hours out of five sharp-hours goes there. And then there are 40,000 more households who are very important, and they need one of the sharp-hours that was actually discussed here in the context of the reserve. I\'m not the right person to say which is more important, either 1 point-hour or 4 point-hours. I can give you a personal opinion. This opinion is that what good is a heated room with expensive gas supplies when the job is missing because the company is closed down. And this is where I get back to the peak load. Gas as fuel is specific in the sense that it helps to survive those moments when basics do not work. And when we\'re thinking of a hero, the main thing is the wind, the sun and the recording. So actually, when we talk about the future perspective, when we think about gaseous fuels, gaseous fuels, future renewable gases, these hydrogen, biomethane or synthetic gases, they actually help to survive these peaks especially in our climate zone when the wind doesn\'t blow, the sun doesn\'t shine, and the storage tanks are empty. Looking at today\'s moment when we are talking about, for example, in the key to the coming years or in the key to the winter that is now coming, if, even in January of this year, there were 2200 megawatts of gas in Estonia and electricity hasn\'t gone for more than 1600 jokes, then we understand what we heard in this first report that this 2,200 megawatts can\'t be pushed in quickly. This would require substantial reinforcement of the electricity system, upgrading. And is that reasonable by the end of the day? For once again, when we talk in the context of a green turn and in the context of renewable energy, it is clear that it is renewable energy production and thinning that should, as far as possible, replace the strengthening of the energy system and the heavy cables in order not to build the large and coarse grid that is now needed and which, hopefully, is not needed in the future when this renewable energy arrives optimally. The second is the biomass side. There has probably been much more talk about this in this Chamber, and the question is, above all, what additional felling pressure it creates. I can say personal opinion again. Where biomass can be used in district heating, efficient cogeneration mode, it should be used as much as possible in Estonia. If it is possible to abandon gas, oil shale oil or any other fossil fuel anywhere, this should be done. But this is where we talk about efficiency of about 90% and where biomass is produced from both electricity and heat. However, this consumption capacity is at the edge of exhaustion, and if we continue to talk about biomass only in the production of electricity, so if there is no efficient cogeneration, because there is nowhere to put it, I would say that it is wiser to do with wood than to drive it into a 30% efficient furnace. All these alternatives have a different side and have an alternative cost in the economy. If we have options, how much does one or the other one cost? The rapid transition to heat pumps, not to mention the increase in electricity production and deficit ♪ investment in technology alone in order to replace gas, is one-and-a-half billion. We ourselves imagine the pace at which this investment can be made, whether on a market-based basis or otherwise. And in the case of biomass, as I said, these limitations are even greater. But we know that the consumption of today\'s 1600 megawatt peak load in Estonia, for example on the cold January day, when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow, the peak load capacity we control, the power generation equipment that can solve this situation, is not enough, we are already missing them. How some analyst likes to model, but there\'s a shortage of 400-1000 megawatt-hours. If we put this at the end of the electrification, we\'ll put 1,000 megawatt-hours of deficit there. And today we depend on imports. What I want to say is that in this development that has been, very right things have been done. The energy economy has invested in the right things. But this coin has a different side and the other side is what should compensate for this renewable energy, which is unmanageable, and cover these vertices when there is not enough energy. This side is part of the orphan child and, in fact, that is what causes shocks in the price of electricity or energy at all. This is not specific in Estonia. The same structural problem is facing the whole of Europe, and that is why we are in the middle of an energy crisis. But now closer to LNG. Having spent last week in Washington and Houston to be sure in his soul or in his heart what is done on a market basis and what is not done, I dare say that there is a way in which, in addition to energy security, it would be possible to resolve the shocks of the energy peaks that Marko spoke about earlier. That requires one thing. I am obviously simplifying very much in terms of time savings right now, but for example, imports of LNG from America would take place on the basis of a contract of at least ten years. Basically, American natural gas producers and liquefactioners treat anything that is less than 10 years of age they would like even 15 or 20 years of age, but everything that is less than 10 years is basically spot transactions or spot transactions and they do not deal with them. The question may arise as to how this is possible. Estonia is so small and Estonia\'s consumption is so low, and I have also heard that this terminal is not needed, because Estonia consumes only 5 sharp hours. But I have not heard this, I do not know, in the case of the development of offshore wind farms, that Estonia\'s electricity consumption is so low and why we are building such a large wind farm, we do not need it. It\'s no different with gas. For years, a common gas market has been built for taxpayers or consumers\' money. Thus, not all investments in both the electricity market and the gas market are made in view of the needs of the Estonian or Latvian or Finnish markets, but still in view of the regional, at least regional, need [taking into account]. And when we talk about the gas market, Estonian gas sellers today sell more outside Estonia than in Estonia. Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and I dare say, immediately after the launch of this GIPL tube in May, Poland is actually the markets that are being invested in. Yes, of course there are technical constraints and so on, but basically we do not see such an argument that the LNG terminal is too large for the Estonian market. I have to admit, as an entrepreneur, I do not understand this argument. Coming to that slide now, what am I saying? What I mean by this is that if we look historically at the European Gas Exchange Index TTF and, for example, at the light green line that stands at Henry Hubi, we see that if historically prices have been very close together, then already before the war, in 2021, this price difference has started to tear. So it is not the result of war, it is the result of the structural energy - the so-called disbalans that Europe has. This price keeps climbing up.', ""Dear Chairman, Honourable Riigikogu! We are very pleased that today the Riigikogu is discussing energy prices. It's a little bit out of the question that we're dealing with the consequences and discussing the consequences afterwards. All the decisions that need to be made in energy are more than ten years of leisure. So there is no point in talking about what we did four or five years ago, the question is what we did 14 or 15 years ago. Maybe I'll talk a little bit wider to get a picture of what our goal is, what the path to the goal is. Whenever we set a goal for ourselves at any level, the first thing is to set a path toward the goal. What's our status today? We should also monitor ourselves in energy from the area where our energy balance is at all. When it comes to electricity, what is the structure of electricity production? Further feedback: what are the effects of our actions, what are the possible conditions, the potential risks, the potential risks and what we should do to mitigate them if we achieve our goal. And now a picture of where we are all over the world. What we are talking about is that the European Union's climate and energy policy objective of a carbon-free economy means that it is [not] in Europe, not in the European Union, but in the world. [[Show slides.]] A few years ago, in this picture, 81% of our energy economy was based on fossil fuels. Whether it can be brought to zero [previously] or, as China says, by [year] 2060, it is now up to us to decide on all those who adopt directives and decisions. More specifically, in the structure of electricity production, fossil fuels account for 63%. And the electricity consumption is definitely rising, I predict, repeating, because if all industry, all transport, is going to switch to electricity, then surely such an increase is essential. And if you look at even close neighbours, such as Sweden, Sweden plans to increase its energy consumption by 60% by 2045. While up until now the annual increases were 4.6%, they increase over and over again. What's our status? Our condition is in this picture. We became 2019 an importing country from the exporting country and are in almost half of the energy deficit. And I'm quite surprised when we say now that all of this came very unexpectedly and we weren't ready. It somehow resembles a little bit of the time of the previous formation: four seasons are our fault. Since we're going to have a minus degree in December, there's no wonder. That in Norway hydropower resources were smaller, yes, indeed, but such a low point has been before and it has been about 15%. It can't affect [so much] now. Or indeed, our entire electricity system in the Baltic Sea is so fragile that a 10% shortfall in power due to accidents or planned repairs is already causing an anomaly in the electricity system. Life has been the principle of dual reserves in the electricity system: 10% of each electricity system must have a reserve, plus 10% to eliminate potential accidents. So a 10- or 5% deficit shouldn't play any role here. Our power generation has been drawn up on this schedule. The sun and wind are the lower lines and up are our total production and consumption. The consumption line is top, so we've had more consumption this year than production. And these numbers show that much talked about renewable energy is certainly necessary. It will certainly be further developed by Estonia and will be developed by all neighbouring regions with wind according to the wind map. But we also have to take into account that the wind power factor in Estonia has been taken as a result of the last two years It's accounted for by our actual production and our installed capacities. In the Helsinki region of Finland, even worse usage factors are officially applied to the sun. Now what? I guess we have the same roads. This picture is quite a well-known picture, but all the possibilities that have been drawn up here, starting with the efficiency of using the full energy chain and ending with burning fossil fuels, carbon capture, storage or further production, we have. The share of renewable energy in [measures] is 35%, of course the largest share is energy efficiency. But for renewable energy, here is a picture that shows how big renewable energy production is not only in Estonia, but in the whole Nord Pool region. This is where we're going to have two missions. The first task is that energy must be produced between all these zigzags, and the second is that the change in wind speed is very great in Estonian conditions. Last year there were days when wind speed shifts led to a decrease in or an increase in the use capacity of windmills by 22 megawatts per hour. This means that we need to have fast-starting, fast-adjustable capacities to keep up with this wind speed. And even more dangerous [the situation] is in terms of the capacity balance. If we're talking about production, if we divide the output to 8760 hours [year], we'll somehow manage, but the power balance shows that we're going to fall to about 60% minus in 2031, that's eight or nine years from now. And the peak is always the wider region, it is the Baltic Sea or the European region. The question is, where will we be able to cover this deficit? We should be working today on how we can get a top-up dark line on how we can meet our demand for consumption in the case of [filling], which is drawn here by the drop of the controlled capacities. What are the potential sources of production with which we cover our daily consumption and maintain or develop the Estonian economy? Now let's look at the region's energy balance in response to the argument that this electricity is coming from somewhere and we'll buy it. I am not going into political discussions here about whether the interests of the nation state are greater than the solidarity of the members of the European Union, but let us just look at the figures. Deficite is in all our neighbouring countries. Today there are two other countries with a positive balance sheet. One is Norway, which is 100% dependent on hydropower, that is, rain, and wind. And the second is Sweden, which also has enough hydropower and unclosed nuclear capacity today. When we talk about the Baltic States, our deficit today is almost 60% [of the need], so we must certainly think about how to cover it. Now, the next problem is how we ensure this balance sheet. Here's two options. One way is that we have regulators. Unfortunately, the regulators are working on natural gas, and unfortunately we do not have it. This means why does Europe need Nord Stream 2, which is in dispute? Germany has no alternative but to ensure its energy needs with natural gas plants. Another option is energy storage, mainly hydro-accumulation, which accounts for around 97% of the world's storage technologies. This [station] is planned in Paldiski. I'm an optimist, and I think it's gonna be ready, too, not this winter or the next winter, but it's gonna be done. But we have to take into account that its cycle guarantees a maximum of 12 hours, but normally an 8-hour adjustment under peak conditions. But we still have a little longer periods than eight hours of quiet weather. But it is certainly one measure and one necessary project. Eesti Energia is also expected to build a hydro-accumulation plant on the basis of a mine. It's definitely a way out. Another way to store more electricity is with hydrogen. But we have to realize that then we have to have at least three times the power output. For the simple reason that producing one unit of energy requires much more hydrogen energy. There are 50 kilowatt-hours on this diagram or on the slide. We have to have that much power when we talk about energy: we need 50 kilowatt-hours of energy to get 32 or 33 kilowatt-hours of hydrogen energy. That's one problem. Another problem is that hydrogen has to be stored somewhere. Hydrogen's volume and energy density are 3.5 times worse than natural gas. Natural gas cannot be stored anywhere in tanks, we keep it in porous sandstone in Latvia. Today we do not have such a biological possibility, let alone how to transport it and burn it again. And, of course, the last one is the one in the order of the last one, [in content] the most important one, that we have to manage our own consumption. There are a lot of technical ways of managing it today. Unfortunately, they do not have such an opportunity in Estonia when we are talking about domestic and small consumers. This would require that we have local energy communities or energy cooperatives and aggregation at the level of this community. This means that we can also, in certain hours, if electricity is too expensive for the consumer, give up this electricity and receive appropriate compensation for it. Now, what went through today is that we are talking about energy like in a dimension of one and a half. We are talking about energy security and then the environmental impact. But the most important thing, in my opinion, is affordability, or accessibility. Energy has three axes: the first is security, the second is affordability, or accessibility, and the third is environmental impact. All of them must be balanced. There is no point in talking about security of supply [the plan] that [we produce ourselves] or we buy from somewhere. If this is unacceptable for the consumer, it is not possible. Now for that Nord Pool. It has already been said here how Nord Pool's price will evolve according to its latest offer. Is that the best way? I seriously doubt that. I don't doubt the market economy, but I doubt the design of this electricity market. And the reason is also that the electricity market is not only governed by market rules, but there are a lot of policy decisions that influence the electricity market, whether it is the price of the CO2 quota or something else. And we can see that the entire [Nordic and Baltic] electricity market is 400 terawatt-hours. If we look at Estonia's consumption, Estonia consumes about 8 sharp hours, so we are a relatively small player in this large Nord Pool electricity market. And, as was said at the beginning of December, in the Baltic States, the capacity [out of line] was at 1300 megawatts, and this was certainly a very large source of price increases. With such quantities, no 2% is the reason for any increase in prices. This clearly shows that we have a real shortage of electricity throughout the Nordic-Baltic region and also in Central Europe. From the prices of electricity, we are now going to this price. There is also a lot of talk about gas as an engine for rising electricity prices. I'm saying it's half-sister. It is not possible for gas to produce more than EUR 200 megawatt-hour when we talk about reasonable prices and reasonable costs, but our price is slightly different. And as a rule, the gas only fills the need during the loads. So what can these price components be? The price of electricity consists of three components apart from [the electricity itself]: network service, renewable energy fee and VAT. Some measures have been taken by the government. And now what? This is a political decision: it is a tax reduction, it is a [reduction] of renewable energy charges, the removal of domestic and small consumers from the stock market or the imposition of a kind of ceiling on the stock market price. All this can be done as a result of political agreement, all the measures that are written here can be done. This requires political agreement both in the coalition and in the opposition, but I, as the consumer, think that the time has already passed for the simple reason that some entrepreneurs in Estonia are not able to cope with this energy cost. And how, then, can we plan our economy, how can we plan the livelihood of our home consumers? And last. For example, the Netherlands has taken one such decision: they have decided that the consumer does not have to pay more than 70 euro cents per kilowatt hour for electricity. We're talking about a much higher price here, like 10 cents a kilowatt-hour. What I want to say is that it is possible to take measures in European countries, and much talked about in the Nord Pool market, so-called 'protected consumers', that the introduction of universal service is quite acceptable under European Union law. The question now is whether we want it or not. And if you look at the cost of Narva stations today, for example, here too, it was said that it is up to EUR 50, I think there is a cost price in some EUR 40 tour. If we add some profits to it, it may be somewhere between EUR 50 and EUR 55 megawatt-hour, with which Narva Station can sell electricity to protected consumers. If we add a CO2 tax, put a €90 or a €90 tax, we will receive a limit of €140 to €150 per megawatt-hour for consumers protected at Narva stations. Today, as we sit here, electricity costs 300 euros per megawatt hour. Thank you."", ""Honourable Vice-Chairman of the Riigikogu! Honourable Members of the Riigikogu! Good morning, it's a pleasure to stand here in front of you. Surprisingly, you are a beautiful lot. So I'm gonna have to do a little bit more, that's kind of a motivating factor for me. The topic is how to get the price of electricity down, but I'm going to approach it a little differently. Rather, is only contributing to renewable energy helping us to keep the price where it is today. Perhaps we should actually do something more. This is perhaps a little more precise the title of my approach to the subject. Why do I think that? First of all, we need to look at today's world of energy consumption, what it is. Do you think everyone's renewable today? I'm sorry, I'm not. If we look at this percentage distribution, we see that practically 80% or say 79% of the world's primary energy consumption is based on fossil fuels, even though we have had a corona crisis, the economy has cooled, production has decreased. This relationship has remained relatively constant. Of course, it has changed that the share of renewable energy has increased. But this growth is certainly not what we have been waiting for. Let us see what today's European face looks like. You see, there's actually coal consumption. It does not form the majority, as it was for a long time, but about a quarter more could be the proportion of coal. Let's just say that coal and gas together account for half of the primary energy production based on fossil fuels; the rest is to carry the oil. One way to put it, what the hell? Coal stations will be stuck soon, and that's how it is. They're not going to jail because we don't have coal. Rather, they go to prison because their working life and their working resources are exhausted or depleted. Now, if we look at how big the capacity we have on the coal plants, they're still in the gigawatts. For example, the power of the Polish coal plant in Bełchatów is nearly 5 gigawatts or 5 000 megawatts. If these coal plants disappear and we don't build something, what happens then? Then, basically, we're going to have what's going on in England. If we think about why England's prices are high, then the main input fuel they have today is the gas they import to a large extent. And if the price of gas goes up, the prices of electricity will rise. And if we want to go down the general European road or actually along the global road, reducing the use of coal or ending the use of coal at all, there are no fast and cheap alternatives. Why don't we use the gas? But where does it really lead, and is it sustainable? I don't know how to answer that. But let's just say the statistics already show this change. You can see it on that slide. Sorry, I've got a year wrong here, it has to be until 2019 when the intercourse has changed. Gas consumption is already significantly higher than coal consumption since the year before last. Now let's see how suddenly these prices have gone so high. We have an electricity market, it should regulate the price, it should guarantee the best, the most favourable solutions for us, or the price of electricity should be cheap. But before we go into the price of electricity there, we should understand that when we talk about electricity, the consumer, I don't think about it at first either. I mean, it's this power generation that will definitely have a huge impact on my electricity bill. But actually, if you look into this bill, you'll see that in addition to power generation and the price of electricity itself, we also have a network fee. These two factors form the main part of the bill. In addition, VAT, renewable energy fees and excise duties. And if you are now thinking about what the price of electricity today is made up of, on which basis it is formed, and which is an input to the stock exchange price, you will understand that the price of fuel is a very important input, especially in those power plants that burn fuel, it is a gas station, a coal station, or an oil-powered power plant. Of course, we don't have them here, but in the Middle East and somewhere further away. And there's the cost of emissions and variable costs. What can we do today, anyway? In principle, we could still regulate the price by saving fuel consumption. However, we do not really have the instruments to control this world market in any way. And when we talk or think that only gas prices have risen, I made an extract here that, in addition to the gas that has increased several times, the price of coal has actually risen. There is no point in being naive and believing that it has not affected the price of oil or the price of uranium either. Let's just say that all prices have risen exponentially, and that will also cause us to increase the price of electricity. And that's it? I see it's not. In fact, if you look at oil, or oil, now, investments in oil production have been halved by almost half since 2014. What does that mean? Take, for example, a car park. If you don't take care of cars, if you don't repair them, if you don't replace them, then at some point you can't use the park or at least you can't use it. And in the case of oil production, the same is actually expected. We hear there's not so much production capacity anymore, we're talking about oil cartels, OPEC, and everyone's guilty of it. That is one way of saying it, but here, in fact, we need to look at today's political context. No one wants to invest in it because the political image and the environment surrounding us are not conducive to dealing with it. It's fossil fuel. And it has created a situation where we have said that we are going to switch to alternative solutions, and then we will no longer invest in conventional energy carriers. And what will be the result? We have actually created a situation where the share of renewable energy is growing exponentially, but it all needs inputs. So that we can build hydrostations or wind farms or solar parks, or that we can actually start using geothermal energy for all of this, after all, we actually need resources. It requires a resource for the production of concrete, it requires a resource for the production of metals and fuels, also in order to move the machinery fleet, electricity requires everything, everything, everything. And it's all actually correlated. Let's just say that the price of energy has escaped the barrier and that there may not be good and quick solutions to lower the price. In addition, pollution charges have increased. The price of CO2 has already exceeded the EUR 60 threshold, although it is estimated that this would only happen in 10 years. But all these things have been the factors that have driven these prices. And in addition, if we look at the market, I made a small extract here from which you can see that prices have also converged in our northern region. Well, they're different here every once in a while. If you look at the northern part of Sweden or the northern part of Norway, you will see that the cost of energy is a bit cheaper there. But to hope that we will have a significant decrease in energy prices is not worthwhile. I don't want to be a pessimist, but by observing this dynamic and knowing that Norway has built a ready cable connection with England, and from this slide you can see what the price of England is today, it is clear why, under open market conditions, should sell energy to an area where the price of energy is cheaper than it is possible to sell it at a higher price. This also shows that there is still room for growth at the price. In fact, it also shows that production capacity or capacity is becoming increasingly scarce. As I have already said, while the regulatory capacity is decreasing, investment is still needed to maintain the system and to operate it. If we do not make these investments, firstly, we risk that the system will cease to work and, secondly, that prices will become much more volatile. In the same way, I understand that if we make investments, the price will be higher. But my message to you today is this: rather, we will still make the necessary investments by ensuring that prices do not go significantly higher. In this way, we will reduce very large price fluctuations. I believe that this is one of the greatest challenges to be faced in the future. I also wondered a little about why the price of gas increased the most and how it affected us. I touched it once at first. The main reason that is being said today is that our European Union reservoirs have been less met than in previous years, that there has been a droughty summer and that there has been little wind. But, in fact, it is still more than just that gas consumption has just increased so much, and not only in Europe, but also China has gone along with the overall climate ambition. Unlike Europe, they have said that they will meet the targets by 2060, but this also means that they have already taken steps to reduce the existing emission levels. How is that the easiest way to do that? This is the easiest thing to do, just as I told you at the beginning, by gradually shifting from coal to gas energy, thus reducing CO2 emissions. But then there's gonna be even more competition to get gas, basically the market works again, right? That if there is more demand, there will also be more wanters who are willing to pay a higher price. That's how these prices go up. And actually, that's one of the reasons why he's still starting to carry coal power. Now, if you look at the price of coal, the increase in coal energy is also due to the fact that volumes are decreasing, but the costs of processing and receiving coal are still the same. Let's just say there is a scale effect at stake, and when the scale effect decreases, prices actually have to rise. And the other side at this higher price is political. Yeah, I agree with that, but the other way around, if there is a market and if there are customers who are willing to pay a more expensive price, why should they sell at a cheaper price? I don't see why, it would be contrary to market rules. What could happen now? Let's see how much of our gas is coming from Russia right now. In order for there to be a redistribution, we will start to consume more LNG, which we may be going to import from, for example, America. But that doesn't mean it's gonna be cheaper. I see a much greater risk here. We are actually seeing today that, with the current decisions that gas is our transitional fuel, its consumption volumes are increasing significantly. So we've got ourselves addicted. We make ourselves dependent on other countries outside the European Union. Actually, I could ask you if you can tell me why we still want to contribute the most to renewable energy. Why are we not dealing with the efficiency of technologies and also developing the use of fossil fuels? Can anyone tell me? It is simply that we do not have these [renewable] resources. It's actually that simple. If we look at shale gas, it may be a little in Poland, but there is basically no gas in Europe. Coal is also low and in fact existing coal plants are either closed or closed. And if there's no oil, what do we do? So we're developing the resources we have to take. But is this right in the Estonian context today? I still dare to question what the dynamics of energy production have been like and what the views have been, I don't know, I'll be an old person soon enough, either 10 or 15 years ago, when I started studying at the university. It has already been said that we will not contribute to the regulated production capacities based on fossil fuels in Estonia's context, because the use of oil shale for energy production by 2015 to 2020 will be zero. It's different now. Our situation would perhaps be quite different if we had invested in time and renewed our production capacities. If you look at the ecological footprint of these old dust-burning blocks, I think we are doing more damage to the environment than we are holding them and deceiving ourselves that they will help us ensure security of supply. It's easier to say we stop using them at all. I understand that these decisions will certainly be difficult, painful and expensive, but we are still taking a step closer to the climate change. Our goal is to save the environment. It can't be that we're betting so much today to improve the environment, but, I don't know, some days or one month a year we use old blocks. That's enough to undo all the work we've done so far. I have been thinking about who is the most advanced and most successful green-turning country, who has contributed the most to this area. And I thought one thing was my story, but another thing is if I can figuratively show you what Germany's energy production is now and how it sees the future. I have put forward a scenario here for the future. In Germany, they are different, but the principle is the same. Let's look at this first graph, it's German power generation in October of this year. You can see that basically half of energy production comes from renewable energy and half is from fossil fuels. Nuclear power has also been taken into account. I mean, the next slide will see it nicely. Here you can see that a very large part of Germany's base load is guaranteed by nuclear power. But if we think that Germany has decided to shut down the coal plants, how many gigawatts will there be? 20 gigawatts! You're gonna take out the nuclear power plants from here. How much do they give now? I think there's actually two gigawatts left. They actually promised to shut down the coal stations this year for 6 gigawatts. All of this actually puts even more pressure on some kind of substitute energy production. And what do they say it is? Gas! All the more so, gas consumption will increase if you look at Germany's primary energy consumption. I also took a look at the week that shows that there has been less wind and the sun, of course, is only in the day. So you actually see, in the example of Germany, who has made a significant contribution to renewable energy, that there is still a very long way to go. And if, in this context, we think that there is still a need to ensure the functioning of the system, do we, in Germany's example, dare say that only 100% of the contribution to renewable energy will help bring down the price or at least keep it stable? The more important question, however, is whether it will help to keep the system running, i.e. to be reliable. All these questions should be answered. Do we have enough of these additional wind and solar parks? Let's just say it's not enough. I would like to give an example of another German study. At the same time, I will also say this, the results of all the studies that have been carried out so far, we can already throw them into the trash because they have been done on other assumptions, on other grounds. They are based on old gas, coal, oil and uranium prices, as well as low CO2 prices. All of today's steps would require new input, new research, economic analysis. Before that, we don't know what to do. And you see, in fact, in its future scenarios, Germany is contributing to wind farms, land and sea wind parks, solar panels, and also, how to say, solar thermal energy. But pay attention! If you look here, they're going to go up to 175 gigawatts in this scenario, if you take even land wind parks, but they're actually contributing to the adjustable capacities at the same time. And if you look at what these capacities are, you will see that, in fact, Germany will not give up coal until at least 2035. There is still a very large increase in the use of gas turbines from there on. But they work on fossil fuels. So you shouldn't think that if we only contribute to renewable energy today, the system will work. You will see, even in the case of Germany, that we must also contribute to the adjustable capacities. What are they like? This is now a decision-making place, but we need to look at the whole system as a whole. Yeah, we can count on the market somebody to do it for us. At the same time, we should realise that, if there is a lot of renewable energy, there are periods where the price of this energy is very cheap. We are perhaps also talking about the so-called 'negative price'. But when does the price of energy go up? When there is no renewable energy. And if we don't have the power we need, then we're gonna have to buy somebody some energy. And does he sell it cheaply? I won't. Consequently, we may also lose the profits that could then be earned and which would contribute to the reliability of the whole system. In order to show that this problem is actually serious, this has highlighted the case of 8 January this year on the European network, where the frequency fluctuated beyond the permitted limits. Firstly, the two large network regions of the European Union separated from each other. This is now a lesson in history and the system has been made more reliable. Firstly, the regions will separate and then local networks will be protected by shut-downs. But what did it really mean, or why did it happen? This was due to the increasing decrease in regulated production capacity. And we also don't have the instruments to keep this frequency as high as it needs to be. And then the system starts protecting itself and starts shutting down. But let's just say that if this frequency eventually goes beyond the permissible limits or over a certain period of time, the whole system is down and it's very difficult to get it going again. This other graph right here is a bit of a bad, dark background. But you can see Nordic energy production: there are nuclear, wind, hydro and thermal power plants that work mainly on fossil fuels. And watch the frequency! We need all these forms of energy production to maintain the quality of the network. And also an example of our Nordic system, the use of wind energy and the fluctuations. You see, 15 gigawatts have even been caught from time to time. But consumption is relatively stable, only a little different nights and days. But there are no major fluctuations. This is a consumption that we cannot guarantee without regulated capacity and storage facilities. If we look at our Baltic countries now, we will see that we have been in a deep deficit. There is scope to invest in both renewable energy and regulated capacities. And what's the situation with the power controls today? As you can see, we have done nothing to have them. And there are fewer and fewer of them. And what shouldn't actually be displayed here, or I shouldn't do, is the Estonian Power Plant and the Baltic Power Plant, because their so-called steam side is basically old. Turbine resources have been exhausted and this will further increase the need for more regulatory capacity. If you look at this right-hand graph, you'll see what the maximum consumption is. And if you're thinking about what I've been saying today, if you know that the power controls are getting smaller and smaller, with the maximum consumption, but nothing has happened, what will happen anyway? Well, I've brought out a scenario here. The thing we do is the efficiency of renewable energy. Is there any way to switch fuel? We cannot do much of that in principle, because we no longer have such capacity. We are a long way from nuclear energy. There will be carbon capture, which will allow fossil fuels to continue to be used in the future. What does that really mean? Now, if we were to build gas stations, we could talk about CO2 emissions, if there are new plants, I don't know, up to 375 kilograms of produced megawatt-hours of electricity. But if you look forward, with the wind, we're somewhere today, that we still have to consider the need for regulation capacity so much that we can achieve with gas turbines, I don't know, 150-250 kilograms per megawatt-hour. In this context, we could still think and actually take a step ahead of Europe. If Germany has said that they will switch to gas, then we could think about how to apply carbon capture technologies. It is expensive, I agree, but if the input prices of gas and other fuels are increasing, it will actually make more sense to apply this technology every day. And here I would even thank the country, because it has also contributed to this area in this context. In March of this year, we completed a climate study of RITA. We examined the technologies for carbon capture and storage when using existing production capacities in the oil shale industry. If one new power was built, how much would it pay, and what would emissions be? We found that if the objective was to implement capacity over the next five years, this price could be EUR 76+ per tonne of CO2 caught. When you think about how much we have to pay for CO2 pollution, it seems pretty close, especially if we look to the future. Here's one more slide of where the boundaries are. If we use only oil shale, we are talking about the megawatt-hours of electricity produced from 150 to 170 kilograms, if we use oil shale. What was not included in this study is ash. If you think about how much cement is being used in the world - 4 billion tonnes - then there are 2.3 gigatons of CO2 per year. If we take away the ashes and contribute to research and development to produce cement from it, then we can also dismantle this part of electricity production and cement production can be shown to be more environmentally friendly. In the context of this study, we also actually considered that if half the wood is used, a negative emission can also be achieved. And actually the same thing can be achieved if we use ash. A negative emission can then be achieved in the cement industry. This cannot actually be achieved by other conventional technologies. I'd be happy to tell you more about the benefits later. Now I've been telling you what the components of the price of electricity are. But my proposal today is also that we should also begin to differentiate network charges, depending on the way in which electricity is produced. I know that there is a desire to differentiate between consumers: ordinary consumers and large industrial users. The losses are different. Yeah, I agree. But in fact, network charges should be differentiated precisely in the context that yes, wind energy and solar energy are cheap, but in order for the system to work, investment needs to be made. And therefore, the consumption of these energies should also be more expensive. Their network charges should be more expensive. For those offering regulated capacities, the network charges should be cheaper. I get it, I think I've got a lot of time.""]","<|system|>

I will simply read the opinions of three factions received by a committee, like my colleague, simply, managing your time. I will read the opinion of the dialogue fraction I received, the LMP fraction, and then the Momentum fraction literally. And I will manage your time so much that I will give my own faction and the opinion of the MSZP in the faction circle. First, I would like to give you the minority opinion of the member of the committee belonging to the Group of Dialogue. Ladies and gentlemen, The history of this budget dates back to at least thirty years, as this budget has been the last thirty years, and the continuation of the failed Hungarian economic policy of the last ten years. This budget reeks of economic policy, the result of which is that the losers of the regime are getting lower and the winners are living in a better and better way. Ladies and gentlemen, I was raised by my mother, alone, working as a social worker in child protection. I know what it's like to eat greasy bread at the end of the month if there's nothing else. My family was the family of the losers of the change of regime, and the fact that I am here now is not the Hungarian normal, I owe it not to your political elite, but to the job's best luck. While you are crying out for a nation state, fighting for sovereignty and flogging foreign capital, it is clear from this budget that the nation state is used only in the interest of their political interests, their own elites and not for the nation as a whole, that sovereignty is not the sovereignty of the people, but of their own power, and that they are fighting with the great capital only if it is in their power interests and not when it is in the interests of the people. You're not trying to move the people forward, you're trying to create new chief priests, new oligarchs. You have learned nothing from the mistakes of the Hungarian economy before 2010, and you have no concept of pulling the country out of a crisis. You are the lucky knights of the global economic growth of the last ten years, and let us acknowledge that you are the most skilled users of power magic. If we look at next year's budget, we can see that they continue to pay the workers. Instead, we tell the rich to pay. It is unacceptable for us that you want to fill the gaps in the budget from VAT, sja, excise duty, which, yes, in addition to the war, and yet your corrupt government for their power and their power are poured out by their completely irrational distribution of economic policy. You are pursuing a tax policy that serves the unspoken magic of your word, the paying of the employees! It's for your needs. You have reduced corporate taxes to 9 percent and let the biggest companies pay even less tax with the trick. Audi should have paid 60 billion in the last five years, instead paying 3.9 billion corporate taxes. And what's in it for them? A little more support is 8.5 billion, twice as much as their tax on the last five years to create 500 jobs that will be filled by workers from jobs to be closed soon. You give Audi 17 million forints for a new job, they pay the wage costs for three years in advance. Obviously, the Audi is still bringing some to the country. But how much does it take? How much do you leave to get me out? How much do you leave with the rich when you're taken from the people? You are trying to fill the budget holes with 27 percent VAT and inflation, the weak forint. While they are tying $2,000 billion off the workforce, they are collecting $650 billion from the special taxes alone, most of which are consumption-type taxes that they know are going to be passed on to the people. Then whose side are you on? Who's gonna pay? You will inflate the salaries, and while Orbán's salary, the salaries of the ministers are increased, you hope that the multinationals will increase the salaries of their employees due to weak forints. This will increase the average wage and your associated salary, but the real value of the salaries of police officers, teachers, nurses, firefighters, social workers and cultural workers will decrease. In the meantime, seasonal work will increase the tax on chips most affecting the poorer and it is expected to increase the tax burden on most of the now available jobs. You are pursuing a policy that increases the differences in this country so that you can understand it: the high priest and the nation's day laborers. While you are lying about sharing a burden, while there is no tax on casinos, there is no tax on the companies of Mészáros, Garancsi and Tiborcz. While there is no solution to the housing crisis, there is no solution to rising food prices, there is no solution to the emerging social crisis, you are still pursuing a perverted redistribution in which the richer receive twice as much support from the state as the troubled. It's not a community, it's not a nation, it's a budget for feeding their own power. This budget is a continuation of the post-regime economic policy described best in the report of the German Chamber of Industry in May. According to German companies, taxes and salaries are low and labour law in Hungary is weak, although skills have improved, but not the Hungarian education system has improved, but you are bringing in foreign workers at an amazing pace. On the other hand, the lack of security of the rule of law and corruption hinder competitiveness. This is your Hungary. Five years ago, only 8 million, today we are paying 17 million forints to create a job. For three years in advance, they pay the workers' wages to the big companies. Hungarian companies could also be successful from this. And the money that they give direct support, they give it tax relief, they give it to multinationals in unpaid taxes, they lack Hungarian medium-sized enterprises, they lack education, they lack health care, they lack this budget. The money from which they pay their own power, their oligarchs, is missing from the salaries of teachers, firefighters, social workers, policemen, people working in culture. You are building the state from crisis to crisis, making more money out of the country, pouring more money from the state into your own pockets and leaving less and less to the Hungarian people in the development of the Hungarian economy. And crises are coming faster and faster. Capitalism uses human and natural resources as one, conquering new and new territories. We see how the transformation of the natural conditions in Syria has contributed to the civil war and this refugee crisis, and we see how desertification will contribute even more to this worldwide. We see that large epidemics are the result of the exploitation of nature's resources, and there is still a likelihood of an epidemic like Covid. [[20.40]] We can see how the fight for water, land, food, rare metals, requires redistribution of battery production, the market for electric cars. In this situation, what you are doing is building Hungary on a crisis-to-crisis model; that you do not strive for a strong public administration, public authorities, people, knowledge, health care, the protection of our environment; in a period of crisis such as this, this is a dead end of politics. A strong Hungarian state should be sought to protect the people, not the powerful, not the Archbishops, not the oligarchs. But this sovereignty, in fact, is popular sovereignty. This budget is a budget for cuts in Orbán, a neoliberal, anti-state budget based on chamumodernisation, which takes no account of needs. There's still a way back. You can still tax your casinos, Ripper; you can still bring a decent property tax; you can still manage the problems of living, housing, food crisis; even you can replace the drapes from the employees to the rich. They can also start building a new economic model based on knowledge and talent, creating opportunities and prosperity, making a living instead of working, human happiness instead of human resources. But the basis for this is not for the workers, but for the rich. They can open a new paper in the history of the Hungarian economy, which uses capital for the benefit of society as a whole; it strengthens medium-sized enterprises; it strengthens businesses that do not take out or distort capital; it can create world-class businesses and companies that are at least relevant in Europe; it can guide the Hungarian economy for up to 20-30 years. But we don't see that, we're seeing the Orban restrictions. What we're seeing is that you're going to appoint a high priest and raise the taxes of the day laborers. I think that says everything. Ladies and gentlemen, That is precisely why we can only alleviate the damage you cause; you are causing Budapest, Ferencváros and Józsefváros. We can only settle the withdrawals and promises that you owe to the people of Budapest, Józsefváros and Ferencváros. Please, as it is everywhere in the world, support public transport in Budapest with as much as the capital will put in it, as this community transport is not only used by the Hungarians, but also by all Hungarian citizens; according to the calculations, the proportion of users in Budapest and non-Budapest is also equal. We ask local authorities to be able to benefit from the public burden paid by the owners of motor vehicles, thereby ensuring the source of good quality public service for motor vehicle owners. The solidarity contribution of local authorities should remain at the level of 2019 for which the amending proposal takes the relevant rules and appropriations of the 2019 central budget literally. Don't take another 20 billion from the capital. Please give us the HUF 6 billion awarded to the Chain Bridge. They have no right to sell Budapest, and they have no interest in it, because without Budapest there is no Hungary, there is no Budapest without Hungary. Support the solidarity fund created by the capital city to generate an additional HUF 300 million from state resources. The livelihood crisis that you will continue to strengthen is causing huge problems. The capital solidarity fund is trying to address these problems, the problems for the poor and the problems caused by poverty. In my constituency, where the country has most social care systems, the current homeless system you bleed out of the money you lack in social work is one of the difficulties for homeless people and local residents. Please support it, and I urge Máté Kocsis in particular, and he should also support more money to solve the common problems of homeless people and the Yovezváros. Please also support the arrival of at least 300 million forints in Józsefváros for energy investments; obviously, a national programme would be needed to renovate condominiums and panel houses, which would reduce our overhead, our energy dependency, and the planet, but since we do not see this, please at least help us in this district. The housing crisis is a huge problem and there is no support for the municipalities. Please help make 800 apartments available for use, which are empty, can be renovated and now owned by workers and families living in poor housing conditions. The municipality has no money for this because of your withdrawal, so do it. And what we yoga people are asking is that you keep the promises that Fidesz VIII made. His district politicians, Mr. Máté Kocsis, and Mr. Botond's future Archbishop Sára promised state budget money. Please support the confirmation of the local police by HUF 500 million, since the local police that you are supervising are barely on call for decommissioning. We also ask for support for the renovation of Horváth Mihály Square, Népszínház Street, Orczy Square and the Square of the Thirty-Twenties. The renovation of the district playgrounds, the renovation of the condominium and the opening and renewal of public toilets and district green spaces are also essential. We also ask you to support the renovation of the Dési Huber Cultural House at the József Attila residential estate, so that retirement and children's programmes can finally be implemented in better conditions. We don't see the first phase of Student City in the budget. This was not only promised in a contract with the capital, but also in a contract with Krisztina Baranyi in connection with the athletic stadium. At least the 4,000 dormitory seats should be built for our children, and not for some private developer, but for young people from the difficult situation in Pest and rural areas. Finally, on behalf of the Ferencváros, we ask that you support the urban rehabilitation. If not as before, but at least help renovate two houses in Ferencváros, and one in such a way as not only to alleviate the housing crisis, but also to improve the living conditions of disabled people. Not much to ask. An oligarch of yours gets more than that a month. This is all we humbly ask of the Archbishop lords for the people, a more livable Budapest and the return of resources taken from Budapest. In the foregoing, therefore, I presented the minority opinion of András Jámbor, the representative of the Dialogue, which he attached to the Committee on Budgets. And now the representatives of the Committee member of the LMP Group, I am going to express my apologies and minority opinions. This year, the country's budget will have to be adopted in the face of several interrelated, serious crises. We are at the beginning of a new period of danger, and this budget should prove that the government recognized them and prepared the country for it. Unfortunately, on the basis of the draft ahead, we can say that this is not the case. The government denies change, crises. The whole budget is based on the fact that next year everything will go back to normal. He's not coming back. Yet, instead of the future, the government looks to the past. The countries that quickly realize what the new world will be like and change accordingly will be the winners of any such major restructuring. According to the LMP, the solution to the economic crisis and runaway inflation is public service wage increases and greater contributions from rich companies and people. A crisis is always an additional burden for a society, and it is almost entirely the government's competence to bear the extra burden. The current neoliberal government has decided that Hungary should remain a tax haven for large foreign companies in the middle of such a crisis. At the same time, he is idly and helplessly observing that one month's wages for civil servants have already been taken away by inflation. It doesn't have to be that way, it's the consequences of the government's decisions. Unfortunately, the neoliberal Orbán government has been working for 12 years to provide extra profit to foreign corporations coming here, and not to mention public money to its own oligarchs. Meanwhile, he is treating his own employees extremely step-by-step, under-paying them, and is now preparing to fire tens of thousands. However, it would be in the interests of the country that public service workers should first ensure inflation-following wage increases and then complete wage arrangements in the public sector: standardising pay signs, linking them to the increased minimum wage, the guaranteed minimum wage and to a minimum of 30 per cent of the equivalent, ensuring normal career models. This can be covered by the fact that multinational companies and large domestic companies would pay a normal profit tax. Instead of today's 9 percent, they would be taxed with the re-introduced top key, which would be raised to 25 percent by an average corporate tax level in Europe. [[20.50]] Similarly, we would expect more contributions from rich people in the form of large wealth taxes and from high income earners in the form of progressive income tax. We have the energy crisis on our hands, and the solution is energy independence. The government's spasmodic attachment to Russian fossil fuels is against the interests of our country, and there are many casualties that are unnecessary. No solution is Western or other oil and gas imports. The solution is true energy independence: reducing our energy consumption, especially gas consumption by modernising the building stock, and making much more use of renewable energies, wind, sun and geothermal energy. This should also be supported by the budget, as should the need to reduce the energy use of transport by switching masses from driving to public transport, for example through a national climate lease. The solution to the food crisis is food self-determination, i.e. self-sufficiency. Instead of large estates that exploit soil, water and the environment, which produce raw materials for export, land and water conservation, based on family farms and cooperatives, can ensure the security of food supply so that everyone can have a healthy, affordable food, regardless of the storms of the world market. It is not a solution to further wandering the state's land, selling our national treasure, selling the land, we must reject that. Finally, the first and most urgent response to the climate and ecological crisis must be the green area moratorium. In the eyes of Fidesz, the green surface is just another opportunity to make money. The forest, the lake and nature are only sets for another hotel or tourist investment, from which the economic hinterland can fill its pockets, even though the integrity of our natural environment is the key to our survival. We would therefore call for a green land moratorium to stop the devastation. For example, for the expropriations required, the coastal bands of large lakes need budgetary resources, which could be covered by increased green taxes and product charges on the basis of the polluter-pays principle. In conclusion, this budget does not want to solve Hungary's problems, but to cover them. In our view, we needed a budget that would make our country fairer, more self-sufficient and more sustainable. The proposal submitted by the Government is not suitable for this, so we cannot support it, and we are attempting to improve it with our amendments. So until now, the representative of the LMP, Bernadett Bakos, on the committee, he is the delegated member, and I have read the opinion of the minority. Now, for the time being, because the position of the MSZP, as I have indicated, and then I will read it in that comment, I will give you the minority opinion of the member of the committee belonging to the Momentum Group. The government's budget is a budget of poverty, which does not harm the sacred cows of Fidesz, but hurts people's wallets, which also takes out extra profits for loss-making industries, while in the last decade it expects no extra contributions from the oligarchs of public money, the national capitalists of Mészáros and Szíyj, or foreign multinationals rewarded with gigantic tax incentives. Whoever has it is given to those who do not have it, even what he has can be missed. But not only in revenue planning, but also in spending, this unfair government approach prevails, because in the grip of hyperflationary, with a war next door, the government continues to spend hundreds of billions on communication and on basically controversial giant investments, such as the Paks II project, which will continue to be carried out by Russians who have fired nuclear power plants in the line of war crimes. It is extremely worrying that, apart from soldiers, Rosatom specialists have appeared in the Zaporizzs and Chernobyl nuclear power plants. This has not been the case before, and it violates fundamental principles of nuclear safety. When I see two Russian nuclear power plant chief engineers going into the Zaporizzsa site and trying to take over the operation, I get very bad feelings. These acts are absolutely unacceptable. If nuclear safety issues cannot be resolved in a satisfactory way, Russia, more specifically the Rosatom, is going to cut the wood out of the international nuclear profession. If things go on like this, no one in Europe will allow any power plant equipment delivered from Russia, whether computer, IT or control equipment, to be incorporated into a nuclear power plant, said Attila Aszodi, former government commissioner for Paks expansion. In such a situation, however, the project receives a HUF 150 billion capital increase. Despite the difficulties in the government budget, we would be able to protect Hungarian families from the dramatic poverty-saving effects of inflation. As an employer, the government should also set an example of protecting the standard of living of its own employees. Yet, some 600 thousand public service workers expect substantial wage increases, but they are not in next year's budget. The situation of teachers is particularly critical, as they have been on strike for six months with an immediate, 45 percent wage increase claim, which, according to experts, was absolutely justified if they wanted to halt the increasing growth of the teachers' shortage and restore the financial appreciation of the teaching profession. Yet, the government promises only a 10% wage increase next year, also from EU funds. With such inflation, this can be called maximum maintenance. This raise can be applied to their hair by teachers. Isn't the future of our children important to the governing parties? Isn't it important that you get enough teachers in schools, you get enough kindergarten teachers in kindergartens? But the situation is similar for hospital workers who have watched doctors raise their wages in recent years, while they have only got crumbs. The fact is now that more and more doctors are working as professionals, because there is a higher number of job vacancies. And then we didn't talk about the police, where, in one week, 300 people had been discharged from the force as soon as this opportunity opened up, while many had previously joined parties only to provoke their departure during the emergency termination ban. But firefighters and disaster workers also have such a shortage of numbers and demoralisation that it is already a threat to security of supply. But we must not forget the employees of the local government and government offices, the workers of the social and cultural sectors, the workers of the crèches, whom we talk less about, but the prospects for their earnings are just as pathetic. Katalin Novak used to call these public service salaries ridiculous, and I think it's rather painful and humiliating. Even though they have received some increases, some arms money in the election campaign, it is not enough to protect them from the cracks in price increases and to change the negative social perception of working in the public sector, to improve the increasing shortage of numbers, and to give real respect to those on their shoulders who rest our safety, the future of our children and the health of all of us. In addition to public sector workers, the budget puts those in need in a very difficult position, as the family allowance and the amount of social benefits remain constant, while prices remain in the stars. But we also miss the strong protection of our green values and the substantial action taken in the fight against the climate crisis. There is insufficient resources for energy development, renewable energy deployment and the development of environmentally friendly modes of transport, and our grandchildren will also regret this negligence. We need a future-protecting budget, which protects the well-being of Hungarians in times of crisis and ensures that Hungarian families plan their future in their homeland and not abroad. To do this, we need to spend taxpayers' money where it has the best place: hospitals, schools, jobs and the protection of our environment. The government's budget isn't like this, so the Momentum Movement faction can't support it. I gave the Commission's minority opinion on the Momentum fraction of Endre Tóth. Thank you very much for your patience, I finished the comment."", ""Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, On Monday, at the hour of immediate questioning, I wanted to draw the Prime Minister's attention to the fact that the economic crisis is here, knocking on the door, as György Matolcsy indicated, while the budget does not show that we are prepared for this, and the budget does not contain any measures on how we will manage it. We have very little belief that the government wants to raise the reserve by HUF 50 billion, or that there is a provision of HUF 100 billion, which is intended by the government for wage development and hospital development of the public sector. I also pointed out that the Hungarian economy is very vulnerable, has few legs, and that economic stability can only be ensured by standing on many legs. My questions have been answered by Prime Minister that these issues should be discussed and discussed in the context of the budget. I am very sorry that the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Budget do not participate in the substantive debate. It would be important, especially at the door of a crisis, to have consensus on key economic policy, social policy and environmental policy issues, because in a difficult economic situation, it is the only way to overcome the problems. Dear House, Since the change of regime, left- and right-wing governments have changed, but there was no difference in the fact that budget planning was characterised by narrow-mindedness. All governments were constantly pushing for GDP growth, as if it were the only measure in a successful society, while they did not care that people were working at multinational companies' factories for almost nothing, nor did they care that investments were financed from loans and thus lived up to the future. They also did not address the fact that environmental damage is growing faster than the economy. One example is that in recent years economic growth has been 4 per cent, while CO2 emissions have been more than 5 per cent. In other words, economic growth has always been more important than reducing social differences or increasing pollution. The former governments and the Fidesz are no different from the future. However, it does not take a pro-green politician to realise that we have been using our environment to an ever-increasing extent since the industrial revolution. Today we are using about one and a half times the planet's natural resources, it is quite clear that this is unsustainable and that we have a shared responsibility to reduce or reverse these dramatic processes. [[15.00]] For the purposes of The budget for the year 2006 is a budget of unsustainableness. Instead of doing everything in the government's power to change direction in both economic and social and environmental policies, it will speed up processes in the wrong way. Hungarian society is moving away from the possibility of sustainable development. However, progress towards sustainability objectives, adopted by the UN in 2015, has already been dictated today, because societies are breaking up so quickly, poverty is growing so rapidly in the world and we are consuming natural resources so quickly that we are not only experiencing the future of today's young generation, but we are also putting the lives of the older generation at risk. Next year's budget and tax policy should serve an economic, social and environmental policy that shifts direction and reverses today's unsustainable processes. Dear House, Indeed, it is time to conduct the debate in Parliament on the criteria for sustainability and how these should appear in the budget. The LMP is confident that the sustainable economy is stable, which is why it stands on many feet, primarily using and developing domestic resources, using them in a sustainable way, and which is very important, helps to strengthen the local economy. At the same time, we see that the Hungarian economy has a huge dependence on global economic processes, the performance of multinational companies, the automotive industry, external energy and not least EU subsidies. There can be no question that this dependence needs to be relaxed. Turning to social policy, we should note that social policy should apply the principle of social justice, the reduction of poverty, the halting of society's separation and, obviously, the well-being of people. Obviously, we need wages, education, health care that give everyone a decent human life. Sustainable environmental policy aims to ensure a healthy human environment and the sustainable use of natural resources, and to preserve natural values. Unfortunately, for today, we have overused our environment and polluted it to such an extent that we also need to see that it is now a barrier to the development of the economy. Dear Parliament, The draft budget also shows that the government does not value the tasks of environmental and nature protection and does not take sufficient steps to resolve these tasks. The budget lacks an approach to integrating environmental aspects into sectoral economic activities, including horizontal issues such as tax and support policies, including the intelligent use of EU funds, which have an impact on natural resources and the environment. In this respect, the government's performance is not only insufficient but also directly harmful. Not only is its tax policy flawed in overtaxing the work, but also its support and development policy, energy and agricultural policy, are often only symbolic, while the taxes on the use of the environment and the burden on the environment are particularly harmful to the environment, thereby taking advantage of the chances of the present and future generations. Its approach to the development of public transport is almost unprecedented in terms of the more developed half of the world. Taking into account the budgetary tables, the financing of classical environmental and nature protection and water issues is also very limited, not to mention innovation, programmes addressing new challenges, such as adaptation to climate change, support for environmental research, environmental education and awareness-raising. The collection and evaluation of environmental data also falls under critical conditions, and without a good diagnosis the problems cannot be adequately addressed. A management of natural resources, the protection and restoration of ecosystem services, such as achieving a good ecological state of water resources, making wise use of it, soil renewal agriculture and reducing the adverse effects of climate change, would be inevitable. It should also be noted that the government has little use of resources for environmental remediation, water retention, nature conservation, energy efficiency. There is little evidence of sources to improve air purity, to reduce noise and vibration, and to reduce allergy pollen load. One way or another, the government endangers the health of millions of Hungarians and undermines their quality of life. Let's just think about it, the government's suspension of the implementation of the asbestos removal programme and the national environmental remediation programme is endangering the lives of thousands of people. Dear House, The government wants to spend nearly 140 billion forints on nuclear investment, which I believe is unnecessary, harmful, harmful to the environment and human health. In addition, with the usual tricks, taxpayers are deceived to provide money for the most damaging project of the century. The Paks II. In addition to the 106 billion project capital increase, some 33 billion would be burned in the virtual nuclear power plant expansion, only the latter item was fraudulently hidden by the draft budget under the heading of spatial development tasks in the Central Danube region for the so-called non-fence project. There are several problems with this item. On the one hand, because of the encryption of the investment contract, even the Members of Parliament do not know exactly what the Russians have to build, so they can transfer tasks and cost elements to the Hungarian state at any rate. On the other hand, if the rates shown in the draft budget are real and the additional tasks outside the fence increase the account for the Paks enlargement by around one third, the calculation on the basis of which the return on enlargement was calculated is completely false. So the project will be roughly loss-making. LMP would spend this money on something else. We would like the state to support the Hungarian families instead of building a Russian nuclear power plant of uncertain fate and unduly expensive value, so that they can make their homes more energy-efficient. Every Hungarian family could receive a HUF 1 million non-refundable grant from the price of the Paks Nuclear Power Plant for a complex energy efficiency renovation. Thermal insulation, the replacement of windows and the modernisation of heating could reduce households' energy consumption and their overhead bills by half. If this were to be achieved on a national scale, it could trigger the construction of a new core power plant, separate the country from energy imports, make domestic housing more comfortable and valuable, and create tens of thousands of jobs. If the government waives all these advantages for Vladimir Putin and Rosatom, LMP cannot support that policy in any way. The budget also draws attention to other environmental problems. If it's up to the government, domestic waste management will continue to run. This process began with the entry into office of the Orbán Cabinet in 2010, and continued with nationalisation and the introduction of state price regulation, and today we are talking about the loss of all waste services in the country. A multitude of municipalities remain temporarily or permanently without adequate waste management. The stench is strangling people around an inadequately operated landfill, isn't that what we've heard here in the last few days, weeks, around Hatvan, while the performance of selective collection and recovery is now decreasing year after year according to Eurostat data. And it's costing taxpayers more and more. Next year, more than HUF 3 billion will be spent on financing the waste sector in which everything worked better before you started your amok run, and where at present, public trash storage cannot even cope with the tasks of issuing invoices. [[15.10]] At the same time, there is no money for key tasks of the state such as environmental education, support for civil society organisations in the field of environmental protection and nature protection, or remediation after already known environmental degradations. The budget provides a ridiculous amount of money to eliminate PM10 pollution causing thousands of premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of diseases each year, which has led to two infringement proceedings against the Hungarian government. According to the LMP, the primary task of the State is to ensure the right of citizens to a healthy environment. We can only accept a budget that serves the protection of the environment and health, sustainability and the future. The Orbán government's budget is about the exploitation of environmental goods and the waste of natural resources. The LMP does not intend to play a role in this. Dear Parliament, When we, the Greens, are talking about sustainability, we understand this society as much as we do about the environment. It is no accident, as in the case of the environment, that harmony and balance must be sought, and similarly, a society works well and in a sustainable manner only if the tissues of society are not allowed to be torn apart by the resources and energy at our disposal. Unfortunately, the Hungarian society after the change of regime is characterised by this process. It's breaking up at an increasing rate, and it's breaking up at more and more levels. Regional differences are growing, scissors open in the city and in the village, between graduates and secondary graduates, and there is no reduction in differences between women and men. More and more people are slipping down and narrowing down the circle that increases their standard of living and is getting richer. The wage crisis could not be dealt with by the government at all, so the exodus from Hungary continues. Although the government has increased family tax incentives, it ignores the fact that the first child is also a very serious problem. Moreover, the government has not increased the family allowance in the ninth year, so the real value of the family allowance has now fallen to about a third. Education and health are constantly deteriorating, which ultimately leads again to poor, poor quality services for the poor, while the rich are able to pay for good education and health care. Ladies and gentlemen, The wage crisis has many reasons. On the one hand, bad practice inherited and passed on from previous governments, which kept wages at a low level, and on the other hand the Fidesz government's unacceptable single-key tax system. The current wage increase is a typical example of firefighting, the government's perception that the wage crisis has become unsustainable, which needs to be changed, but there is no thoughtful planning behind it, there is no proper strategy behind it. This increase in salaries is due to increasing and worsening labour shortages. It will therefore not be a lasting solution, since the structural reasons remain unchanged. As long as the government stands by the single-key tax, which the vast majority of workers suffer from, workers' poverty will continue to grow. I can demonstrate that a recent OECD research was published recently, comparing the average salaries of the Member States in purchasing power parities, and Hungary was placed at the top-of-the-line. Among the developed economies, Hungarian averages are only worth more than Mexicans, which I think everyone feels is a shocking figure, but at the same time it is quite clear why Hungarians migrate to Western Europe to a large extent. The elimination of the wage crisis will not be postponed for LMP. One-key tax should be replaced as soon as possible for a single-track, three-key, fair tax burden, where the minimum wage is tax-free and up to three times the average wage is better for everyone. I would like to underline here and say that this is not a tax increase, as we have often received in response here. The introduction of a multi-key personal income tax system does not result in a tax increase. This merely means that higher incomes will contribute more to public tasks and lower incomes will be able to take more home. Unfortunately, poverty is not the only one exposed to workers. We live in a country where working life is not a guarantee of a peaceful and happy old age. According to statistics, some 70,000 pensioners receive benefits below HUF 50,000, and hundreds of thousands of pensioners live below the poverty threshold and the minimum living. For example, these include those who have nursed their disabled relatives for decades, after which they receive a pension of around HUF 50,000. The LMP has repeatedly initiated to increase the minimum pension amount of HUF 28 500 to HUF 50,000, which is also very, very little. It is also important to see that 50,000 forints do not make a living in Hungary today. We have also initiated to make care a minimum wage for work, but the government has rejected it all the time. Unfortunately, the minimum pension increase to HUF 50,000 is also missing from the 2019 budget, but the LMP submitted it as an amendment proposal. I am very interested to see how you will decide on this, whether this amendment will be voted on. If you don't vote for it, I recommend everyone try it for at least a few months to make a living with that amount. With regard to the pension system, the dual inequality caused by gender differences is unfortunately rarely mentioned. Gender equality is particularly important for the LMP and should also be reflected in a fair and sustainable pension system. What we see today is that women's pensions are on average 14 percent lower than men's, i.e. women's disadvantage in the labour market, loss of many years from the labour market and wage disadvantage in the pension. At the same time, however, we know that men reach the retirement age in far worse health and, unfortunately, they die younger. A decent retirement is also a condition for pensions to preserve their value. In the case of pensioner inflation, weighted account should be taken of all expenditure which is typically spent more by pensioners. These include medicines, basic foods, or household energy. According to the LMP, pensioner inflation, pensioner consumer baskets would have to increase pensions in order to say that pensions have maintained their purchasing value. Dear Parliament, This budget is a guarantee from a fragmented, unsustainable Hungary. I would like to ask the Parliament, my fellow Members, with all due respect, to support and accept the proposals of the LMP amendment towards a fairer, more sustainable budget. Thank you for your attention."", ""Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear House, Ladies and gentlemen, Dear Secretary of State, There is no question that the planning of the 2023 budget has reached our country in a challenging international environment. We have just recovered from the crisis caused by the coronal virus epidemic, when the era of energy prices has begun, and the consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian war are putting countries at an extraordinary test worldwide. The effects of all these external events are also reflected in the draft budget submitted by the Government, which, as has been said several times in the House, is the budget for public security and defence. It is important to stress that the Hungarian government is doing everything it can to ensure that the price of war and Brussels sanctions policy is not paid by Hungarian families while protecting the results of recent years. A number of successes have been reported in the past period, and even the difficulties caused by the coronal virus epidemic have not been able to bring to an end, as thanks to the conscious economic policy of recent years, which aims to strengthen the work-based society, Hungary's economy has been hit by a stable state of the virus, which has led Hungary to a much better start-up and economic life much stronger. GDP grew at a historical record rate of 7.1 percent over the previous year. On the contrary, today we have to face the fact that there is a war in a neighbouring country. As a result of the war and the energy policy in Brussels, inflationary pressures have increased and we are experiencing an unprecedented increase in energy prices. During the course of the XXI. We are facing the greatest geopolitical reorganization of the century, a global energy and food crisis. This would be added by the Brussels policy with the introduction of a minimum global tax, which, in this difficult situation, would mean a serious tax increase for companies and increase the burden on businesses. Central European countries, including our country, have pursued a responsible and balanced fiscal policy, so we have been able to keep low tax rates on work and companies. This proposal, on the other hand, would cause the greatest harm in Hungary, as it would entail a serious tax increase for businesses, which would lead to an increase in unemployment. In my view, corporate tax should not be increased to 15 per cent under the aforementioned difficult global political and global economic conditions. Moreover, the OECD proposal originally aimed at taxing large digital companies, but today the focus has shifted and production companies would also be subject to extra tax, which would jeopardise the jobs of tens of thousands of Hungarians. In this situation, the new tax burden on production companies could be fatal, especially if they want to be introduced at the beginning of 2023, while in the rest of the world, who knows when this will be introduced, if at all. Such a decision would put European companies at a competitive disadvantage. I have to say that we are indeed living in a time of crisis and uncertainty, but at the same time we can conclude that the budget presented in these extraordinary times is also a priority for the preservation of Hungarian families, pensioners, high employment and rising incomes, for ensuring the stability of career plans, for the development of health and higher education, and for the implementation of economically and socially significant investments. In order to achieve this, our most important task is to preserve Hungary's peace and security. As pointed out in a study of the MCC Climate Policy Institute, security of stable energy supply, increased energy sovereignty and protection of overhead cuts are currently priority national security issues. In recent days, my fellow factions have mentioned several times that the protection and support of families is of paramount importance to the Hungarian government. In this context, the budget for 2023 contains a number of elements, as the budget allocates HUF 3225 billion for family policy expenditure and benefits to support families. This policy includes, among other things, the guarantee of tax and contribution benefits, the exemption of people under the age of 25, support for children's meals and the provision of free textbooks, but also the continuation of the home creation programme, for which the budget provides more than HUF 490 billion. This is nearly three-and-a-half times the amount spent on housing subsidies in 2010. [[9.30]] As a result of the home creation programme, for example, programmes such as village CSOK, access to housing for families, constructions to improve housing conditions and tax reimbursement support for the modernisation of the residential building can continue. It is also important to stress that these subsidies help not only the situation of families and spare their wallets, but also contribute greatly to the protection of our created world. The renovations improve the energy efficiency of Hungarian houses, and the improvement of the quality of the real estate stock represents an additional step towards improving the energy independence of Hungary, since the cheapest and most environmentally friendly energy is the energy that we do not use. In order to protect our environment, we need to take thoughtful, but effective, steps that will contribute to achieving the climate targets we have undertaken, such as the Government's climate and nature conservation action plan, which will provide an appropriate framework for this. It is not necessary to implement unthinkable initiatives that would burden the population, such as the carbon tax advocated by Brussels, which would make people pay for the cost of the pollution generated predominantly by industry, including the Hungarian population. In its analysis of the Climate Policy Institute, it also points out that this package of proposals would in practice result in a significant increase in fuel consumption for the consumer, a rise in food prices, not to mention the amount of gas bills at home. All this goes against the goals for which our country's government is constantly struggling. The carbon tax would therefore, in principle, hit the less wealthy or the SME sector, who cannot buy, for example, immediately cleaner vehicles, and would therefore face increased tax burdens. In vain, Prime Minister Timmermans called the EU Commissioner for the European Green Agreement a proposal for a carbon tax as a crazy idea. On the basis of the national consultation launched last year, it is also clear that the Hungarian people refuse to charge the public with the cost of greening the European economy. Ladies and gentlemen, The importance of protecting our world created in this budget is reflected in many chapters and appropriations. In line with international expectations, we can say that Hungary's climate policy is fundamentally based on two strategic objectives: on the one hand, it aims to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions, to green the economy's operation and, on the other hand, to adapt to the inevitable effects of climate change. The policy objective is to promote energy saving, climate-friendly energy change and increase the share of renewable energy sources, to stimulate their use and to exploit the potential for economic development of energy innovation and climate change. The LIFE programme and the modernisation fund are another outstanding means of achieving Hungary's climate policy ambitions. With regard to environmental tasks, it is worth mentioning that we continue to support integrated and traditional environmental projects from direct EU development sources with a co-financing of some HUF 473.7 million, while the modernisation fund aims at modernising energy systems and increasing energy efficiency. The stability of energy supply has been assessed following events and trends in recent months. Our country's energy policy will continue to focus on ensuring the country's current secure energy supply, taking into account sustainability, consumer resilience and competitiveness. The aim is to secure, environmentally sustainable and competitive energy production and distribution, as well as to improve energy efficiency and reduce our country's energy dependency. At the same time, the objective is to improve ambient air quality and to prevent the development of air pollution that endangers human health and the natural environment. Measures to reduce particulate pollution by transport, industry, energy production, agriculture and the population are aimed at protecting human health and ecosystems, protecting the environment, the functioning and development of the economy and ensuring the long-term long-term development of society. The new national air load reduction programme sets national targets to reduce emissions of all relevant air pollutants, including measures to achieve them. Ladies and gentlemen, During the protection of our created world, sustainability tasks and utility services are of particular importance, with a budget of HUF 6280.7 million more than the previous year in 2023, i.e. HUF 25 1049 million. This includes the collection and recovery of waste from products subject to product charges, supporting related waste management improvements, performing public awareness-raising tasks, carrying out planning and development tasks related to the documents setting out the strategic objectives for waste management, supporting waste management and water utilities projects, financing the public development of priority economic zones. Additional support from local authorities includes support for the eradication of illegal waste, according to which the government supports the government's fight against illegal waste disposal by HUF 1 billion. To this end, the development of the tendering system will soon begin. Just think of the extent to which these illegally placed waste heaps pollute our environment if there is already a single PET bottle, otherwise recyclable, that has centuries of degradation, during which time it means continuous pollution to the environment. In addition, we should bear in mind that if they were returned to production thanks to the circular economy, the re-use of such products would also reduce the amount of waste produced by society. In this context, it should be pointed out that, for 2023, a surplus of HUF 45 200.1 million will be provided to the State Secretary for Circular Economy. It is also important to stress that the Ministry of Technology and Industry will continue to support organisations, professional associations and non-profit companies with a value of more than HUF 222 million in 2023 that carry out environmental awareness, environmental education, environmental technologies, processes and practices. Ladies and gentlemen, In addition to environmental tasks, conservation tasks are also involved. Speaking of the effects of climate change, we cannot leave without talking about the increasingly dry weather and its impact on agriculture, as most of the problems today are caused by atmospheric drought and drought in the atmosphere. Developing agriculture through sustainable, integrated water management is a key objective for water security and the maintenance of safe food production, keeping pace with the expected effects of increasingly extreme weather conditions. In Hungary, the share of irrigated land is significantly below the European average, one of the steps taken is the 2019 Water Management Act and the 2020 Government Decree implementing it aims to provide farmers and water-based farming customers with opportunities that encourage sustainable water management. These two documents favour irrigation from surface water, as the proper storage, transfer, distribution and use of surface water for agricultural irrigation can reduce the harmful effects of climate change and the excessive use of groundwater with longer supply times, which also provides a significant proportion of domestic drinking water demand. As a new element, the possibility of using purified sewage and grey water for irrigation has also emerged. Through the Act and its package of measures, the obstacles to the implementation and operation of the investment in the development of agricultural irrigation resulting from the domestic mosaic property structure have been removed. [[9.40]] In view of this, it is not surprising that the use and development of irrigation in the budget currently includes a chapter-based appropriation of HUF 489.4 million, which is intended to provide the necessary resources for irrigation measures, since, in addition to the development of the main public works, it is also essential to meet the needs of the producer side for the growth of irrigated areas. In line with this, the protection of our natural values and the further support for nature conservation proposals, for which the Agricultural Ministry is currently providing financial support, are of paramount importance, so that EU and other international resources can be used as widely as possible. Ladies and gentlemen, In recent times, even in the context of the effects of the coronal virus epidemic, we have seen a significant increase in society's demand for multi-faceted services in forests, in response to which the budget places greater emphasis on the development of the economic, defence and welfare services of forests, environmental education in order to improve the relationship between man and forest, and the strengthening of the recreational role of the forest. In addition, it will, of course, continue to place great emphasis on the achievement and achievement of the objectives of the national forest strategy, the preservation and enhancement of forest resources, the development of near-natural forest management methods, the protection of the health of forests, their resilience and adaptability, and the mitigation of the adverse effects of climate change. It is important to use forests today, taking into account the needs of the future generation. It is clear from all of this that the Government of Hungary, in its decisions on the protection of the environment and the protection of families, not only considers the financial support of families, but this vision also covers the protection of the health and quality of life of Hungarian families and the enforcement of the constitutional right to a healthy environment, which is also the aim of improving the state of the environment, economic development and the coordination of environmental aspects. To this end, sustainable use of natural resources, improvement of the quality of the environment, conservation of natural heritage and preservation of environmental safety are key conditions. In view of this, the priority will be to expand environmental awareness programmes, sustainability promotion events, and to continue programmes for environmental education, such as the National School Garden Development Programme, the Green Kindergarten Programme or the,, Save a Garden! A program. It is clear from the numerous budgetary elements listed above that Hungary is today committed to protecting the natural heritage and the natural conditions of the way in which the Hungarian people worked together. This budget can ensure the protection of Hungarian families, the energy security of Hungary, the protection of the achievement of the reduction of the rent, the protection of our created environment and the future of young people, so it is extremely important to support the bill.

President. For five years, economic policies and financial programs on the basis of new laws on public finance are now laid for the first time before the Council. The purpose of financial policy is to set a general objective for public financial development that is open to agreement. The budget includes further implementation of financial policy targets for income, expenses, and economics for public citizens. It's the budget policy. It's the course. The budget will tell you how calm it will be. By enunciating a law on public finances at this time of the year, an important step was taken to trust in the management of public financial matters and to promote greater discipline in public society's strategy, focusing on long - term economic stability. The law contains strict rules on survival and debt development, so - called financial rules. One of the most remarkable reports in the budget is that, according to Article 7, there are good prospects for two of the financial policies. The law will be met in both the first two years of the programme, with a positive overall balance over the entire five-year period and a reduction in the total debt of the government, state and community to 30% of the gross domestic product. Such results promise good results that they will be able to provide the basis for using the resources that are available at the same time to coordinate the financial affairs of the state and of the community and to improve government, as it is planned for new laws on public finances. Much of this matter is important that the automatic debt collection of state funds has been stopped, debt is dropping, and more importantly, how well it has been accomplished in the implementation of measures in connection with the uptrodents of fallen financial companies and a budget removal programme. These two interpretation proposals are now under discussion, and they are brought together in one discussion instead of two, as would have been possible. So it is necessary to assume here that these terms of action are not the same, so I will first break down key issues of financial policy, but later introduce my talk into the financial program, which is presented on the basis of the goals presented in financial policy. A respectable president. The key elements of the financial policy presented here focus on the objectives of development and the debt of government, state, and rural society, as shown in the financial policy table. It is aimed that for the next five years, the total benefit of the official positive result will be at least 1% of national production annually, i.e. Part A and Part A of a rural society, in order to maintain economic stability in the state and lower the debt of the state by law-bound debt. That amounts to some 170 billion dollars. What is left over the rest of the rest over the next five years. The agreement between the state and rural society, signed on April 18 last year in the policy-making process, has agreed to assume that all the rest of the public waste will be made at the A-part of the State Fund, but the recovery of the A-part rural society will be balanced over the period. The meeting place is the first one to be done on the basis of a new law until one year. Governments and rural areas agree to support common stability by following these targets, thus contributing to lower growth, more stability, and higher level of employment. To that end, this is a landmark meeting between the state and rural society. It may be difficult to apply the desired level of government property in the coming years where the need for necessary structure is being developed in society's infrastructure. Low maintenance and investment levels over the past few years, along with gross growth in tourism services, have called for increased structure in pilot activities as well as investments in energy production and electricity distribution. Thus, government policy is that the overall survival of the official public at steady state will be in 2017 and 2018, but then it will result in an increase of about 1% of the gross domestic product on average in 2019◯2021. Governments, in addition to the rest of their targets, have set debts that include the total debt of the A State Fund down significantly during the period from about 32% of gross domestic product at the end of 2016 to about 21% of gross domestic product at the end of 2021. To achieve such a challenging goal, there is far more to it than leftovers on the increase, which is 1% of gross domestic product each year. The estimated decrease in debt ratio is largely due to growth in domestic product production over the period, but a substantial proportion, corresponding to about 180 billion decreases in the value of the debt over the period, based on specific criteria for the provision of irregular revenues, sale of assets in financial institutions to a number of degrees and measures in the reimbursement of certain loans. Furthermore, it is legally legal that the stability of the bank population will be spent in the reduction of debt. A respectable president. The financial policy is based on a practical economic outlook for the period. Economic conditions in this country have improved over the past loss and have shown most practical evidence of progress at present and in the coming years. The overall demand for economy is rapidly returning after a heavy dip following the collapse of the bank in the fall of 2008. According to Economic Standards, since the end of February, the growth of national spending was 6.2% in 2015, 5.8% in 2016, and 4.2% in 2017, after which the growth rate slows down to 2.5% to the end of the programme. This year, in the sixth year of continued economic growth, this economic forecast is followed by uninterrupted economic growth to 2021 will be the longest economic growth in the modern economic history of the country. The foundation of this trend is high growth in private consumption and even more in the investments of the industry at present. Last night, the ASI economy showed that there was a high economic growth and that it was positive that it was based on a solid foundation, where the buyer power is driving on the growth of its private consumption rather than on the payment of its households. It's all at the same well. In spite of high pay increases in labour contracts, both in the general labour market and in the public sector, which have led to considerably greater financial gain than expected. Why is inflation so low? Well, most of the prices have been brought from business countries, including low oil prices and raw prices, and because the crown's gang has also been getting stronger. At the same time, unemployment has fallen a lot. However, production has taken place, and there is a measure of concern, and this can reduce the growth of potential production in the economy. As a result of this trend, the production plant has disappeared, and there has been an imbalance in overall demand and production capacity. However, it does not seem reasonable to expect that the gap that has begun will be in line with the quality of the years for the collapse of the banking system in which there is not nearly as much expansion in the total demand or inexpension that expands on the flow of inexpensive funds. This is not the same debt that we previously saw, much more sound foundations for this growth. However, a large intertime effect of larger investments and construction projects may create considerable tensions in the construction and industrial sector or, depending on individual events. Also, the financial system is solid, based on domestic funding, no longer in risky foreign positions, and it is a business that has a strong personal value. So the situation is somewhat clear; it is clear to look forward as long as a responsible, stable economy is established on the basis of a realistic financial strategy. A respectable president. So I dispute with the budget itself. This discussion provides an opportunity to discuss policy. How should we share the burdens between public members in supporting our stability? How does the council take a course like this that that goes up with a total of 1%? What view do we have regarding the development of debt? What view do we have about how much more we can allow the State to take to himself or to dominate public authorities in current economic situations? These are basic financial questions. But back to the budget itself. It is important that we succeed in going through this discussion, as it is thought - provoking, since we look especially at the wide lines and what lies ahead. It's not a budget for next year, but we're drawing up the financial outlines of the budget. As debt is paid down and the state's huge growth rate is reduced over the years, there will be increased distances to build up socially important structures, to lighten the loads of workers with lower taxes, and to trust in much of the basic services of the state, including higher recoverys to those with the halls, largely successful health systems, and higher levels of education at all levels. Thus, we actually enjoy benefits for future generations and many opportunities for young people who want to live and work here. And this is what this financial program really is about. It paints a picture that says that in view of the marked transition for the better in the financial affairs of recent losses and a good standing in the economy, there is an enormous opportunity for Iceland to increase the well - being of all in this country, taking advantage of the opportunities ahead of us to build up even more and to live in the best interests of ourselves. All the top economics and economics indicate that the benefit of Iceland's people is getting very much better. The commitments of the households go down. The pay of people increases in excess of inflation at the same time as unemployment and employment factors have increased dramatically. What positive news this is for homes in the country! During the past 12 months, pay has increased so much that we have not measured the same level of money since the beginning of measurements in 1989. This is what the numbers for the last 12 months tell us. We also see on other indicators that measure social prosperity that we are moving in the right direction and that we take a position with countries that are achieving the best global success, whether on the basis of the polls like the Social Progress Index, by permission of the President, and I allow me to quote a second report made by OECD, Society at a Glossance. These reports tell us this story. A report on such references 2015 also shows that income distribution in 2014 has not been greater in Iceland for ten years, whether using a Giin or a fifth index, and has greatly reduced the lack of material quality. New reports from Eurostat confirm that no greater equation was made in Europe than in Iceland in 2014. Of course, it is not that each person sees his debts fall as a percentage of land production. Most people do not wonder what they owe as a percentage of land production, but the whole set, about the total property of households as a share of land production, reports a history of how homes in general are developing. What people are primarily concerned about is the next month, the immediate future, how they pay and other provisions for what is needed for them and for that month and that and for that year. But there's no question about it that all the practical people I've been referring to here give a good story about us getting up in the right direction, and actually not just fogging, we're making rapid progress on this loss. We also know that the situation of some social groups, such as the elderly and the desperate, is still fragile, and people in the lower pay steps find it difficult to make ends meet. It is not enough to point out an increase in money alone if it is not at the same time a fair and just exchange between all who share in the community. There must not be any groups of society directly left behind. I believe the numbers we have today show that everyone is participating in the biography application. It does not say that we have achieved final goals. The task is never over, but we will continue to take better care of these factors, the weak and the least to play. The positive news of what we now have in our hands in this council resolution is that we are better off, after a relatively few years from the fall of financial companies, and the problems they faced, to get into position to trust even more the foundation of the welfare of society. In this connection, I especially want to guess that there are numbers in the program that show evolution on various subsidies. You need to be careful when reading the synonym proposal that a large part of the increase that will appear in the social security system is inside a team called pay and prices. This is because compensation will follow what is higher in the future. This is an important thing. I would also like to say, in general, that it will, without a doubt, take some time for humans to understand this new presentation, since it is recently accepted a law, it is a new practice, it is a new perspective that we are publishing on the official finance, and it is only natural for humans to take time to understand it fully; and of course, that this will also be a part of the shape of the budget that will follow the next budget, this change of course. A respectable president. I'm going to briefly address some of the key aspects of the income and charge plan and, hence, the implementation plan, the one we're here with. In terms of the decision-making programme specifically; it is shaped by a good national interest level and the changes in the tax system that have already been legalized. In particular, the midpoint of income taxes goes away at the next year, while 93% of those paying income taxes fall below the middle stage and the next year down the lower level. Tolllar will be eliminated from all products except certain foods. At that time, the income side of the programme has been expected to include a number of temporary and irregular income changes during the planned period, such as bank taxation and stability returns; this is especially due to bank taxes and stability donations. If we compare the past few years with looking into the future, there are considerable fluctuations in the income side, which are largely explained by temporary tax strains or monopolitan incomes. For example, in 2016, which is not part of this five - year program, we are looking up at the very sum of the total wealth that is likely to have no precedent explained by such monocommunication factor, which is the stabilisation process. In previous schedules, we have assumed that the bank tax will be with us longer into the future, and we need to consider that when men compare this long-term plan with their previous long-term programmes; the fact that the worn - out agreements will be completed late in the last year, they will have an effect on the income side of the next two years. There is also a measure of scope for certain tax measures, such as a reduction in insurance fees from the middle of this year, and on the income side there will be a meeting of planned revenues, such as an increase in the level of stayavers and a change in the rules of marriage contracts. Then the budget plan. The policy for GDP aims to ensure that at least 1% of the remainder of the budget will be met. It is mainly assumed that the actual growth of the budget gate will not exceed the growth of land production until 2021 but that the proportion of primarys without irregular joints will remain unchanged over the period. Following the policy measures, there is a considerable increase in the scope of the problems in the fields of advisers. More detailed distribution and disunition to individual lawsuits, and then to institutions, a financial bill of each year and a follow-up will be published. However, the key factors are: Approximately 14 billion room for 2017 is expected to be distributed to specific areas of matter. So here we are talking about an additional vector space on the budget side of the initials compared to 2016. During the exchange of space, special emphasis was consulted, however, to a high degree, for health, education, and law enforcement purposes to get more priority. In addition, between 2018 and 2021, more annual budgets are expected as well as to be divided into individual grammatical areas of employing quality and priority, some 7 billion dollars. every year. In addition to other growths, the additional range of interest is available in key spending areas allows us to have moderate physical growth in the media over time. A combined collection of budgets goes to a new and more than 42 billion projects during the period. There we are talking about 42 billion at the rate of this year. Of these, about 45% of the budget is expected to be reassigned to health care and about 20% for education and culture. Other factors suggest that the maximum pay of the source ordinary funds will be increased, and the management base of high school will be strengthened, along with child reforms and compensations, as well as a year - by - year failure margin in the system. The estimate is that in the next year or more than 30 billion accumulated in 2021, making up more than 200 billion dollars! This amounts to an increase of 18% in the time period. This increase is not an exception to any raise in pay. We're just talking about the business team, we don't have a salary in these numbers, such as doctors and nurses. This will be added during the period as well as in other climate change events. In this context, it is proper to mention that most of the medical expenses involved in paying the institutions and the government's contracts on health care based largely on pay expenses. This is a significant increase and enables us to improve the quality and safety of the service, improve the staff's facilities, and ensure that patients have equal access to national services. These are health - care projects ahead of us. A respectable president. The budget also means that there will be a number of investment projects that have been considered or planned during the past few years, but it has not been considered to be possible to finance and end up in the home business, with a huge burden of Kingdom interest, following the collapse of the bank in the fall of 2008. The financial and national support has now been strengthened, and thus construction can be financed with a marked increase in the regular income of the state's funds. It is not expected that these projects will be spent by irregular temporary incomes of the state funds. I mention some of the main: construction projects on the first task of a new hospital, especially the treatment core, which is now the heart of the hospital and is being designed, and a laboratory. This will be offered out as soon as design is completed and the project will then be fully developed. Another example is the impressive contributions to build up infrastructure in tourist areas. Buying new helicopters for the D.A., we know of the budget of the past few years that we spend a lot of money renting helicopters for D.A. We've arranged here for two helicopters to be bought for the D.A., as it has been for a long time. The production of a new Western island vector will take place within this programme until the next five years. That project is funded according to the plan. Similarly, in the course of transport, an animal tunnel, which has been widely discussed recently, in itself is named elsewhere in a transport program. Building a building on the Capitol, building new nursing homes, building an English - school program that has been delayed is an example of the investments we see here. These and other important tasks are to be handled wisely. Yet, the positive economic prospects that will be faced in the years ahead are not quite there, and especially if we are unable to begin. It is a grueling jacket that will turn out best in the present situation. They need to be careful that the budget supports other economic policies, such as the money policy, in order to reduce the risk of overheating and instability in the economy. A respectable president. I've traced some of the key elements of the plan and financial policy. I would appreciate the importance of the following development of a policy-specific debate because it is such a core and merely a review: The financial policy will always be established for the off-limits, and it will be a guide to the government for the next few years, while the financial programme will be updated every year. I expect here various views of doing things like this rather than queer, to be critical of individual languages that are not guaranteed enough money. It would be best for a grammatical discussion of fundamentals, such as this that the way in which one accepted the needed changes would be made to achieve such goals. In my mind, this is the way we are in this government-of-the-art program, based on the economic situation, but we're aiming at 1% total rest throughout the programme period. I think that's adequate, but the rest cannot be kept very much in order to perform new assignments. We are also watching that in five years, we are going to allow the budget to grow by 10%. It would be nice to think about it for a moment. I don't think there will be many decades in which we can allow the primary charges to grow by 10% so that those who will be involved in this discussion are critical that the original charges will not grow any more, then explaining how it should be possible to be done in the long term without the addition of major productions in Iceland and other fundamental changes. I think it would be good for the rest of the discussion, if they want to take the lead in saying that on the expense side there is not enough growth, that we just take the discussion to see if it should happen in such a way that people walk on the till or if they are going to stress the use of property sales for business or how other people are going to finance it. In the end, I believe that the project that we adopted, by working on public financial laws, standing and falling by what traditions and habits are formed here at the General conference in discussions of these matters for a long time, that when we are discussing these matters, we do not skim directly into a kind of financial debate, but we are able to direct our attention to the broad lines; and then men can deal with whether to be greater or less overall, more or less from paying up debt, whether the rights of the compromises. This is what the discussion should be about. The strategy we face here is designed to balance between these factors, to bring good results that are important under the circumstances, to pay off a debt that is important, not just because of the financial principle, but because we have covered too much in interest for too long. We have a need to bring down the debt before the economy is resolved, but at the same time, we need to allow for extra spending to become important causes. [[The president calls.]] I believe that there is a balanced balance, and I present it here, a respectable president, as soon as I suggest that the matter be referred to. The legal committee following this discussion."", 'Mr. President. I recommend the Central Party\'s Committee on bill for budgets for 2019, a smaller portion of the budget board. Economics are on the rise. National projections estimate that inflation is increasing with omission, which is already under way, and we can see. The recent expansion of the Federal Bank emphasizes concern about increasing inflation. The labour agreements of much of the labour market are running out at the end of the year and the beginning of the next year, and there is therefore a strong uncertainty about the development of pay next year. Salaries beyond the premiums of budgets weigh very heavily on the state\'s Pension bonds. It is expected that unemployment will continue to increase throughout the forecasting period with less tension in the national industry. The budget bill is that my brain knows too much charge. The progress has not been properly prepared for the future. If the premise is not clear, what government resources are going to do is. A show could have been more successful in the state of times. It is unrealistic for governments to trust that there is still much economic growth. There is no evidence that the recent fall in the crescent gang is reversible. The reduction is expected to affect the success of government funds, as we know. The factors I\'ve mentioned here strongly suggest that there may be an extension of 1% of the land production, i.e. 28.9 billion, if not enough. The remainder is too small, compared to the weight of income stocks and the rest of the final economy. Mobility ends, but it seems that the government is not sufficiently aware of this. Clearly, the rate of growth is slowing down rapidly. The less economic growth reduces the income of the state\'s funds. If economic growth is less than expected, the removal of the state\'s funds could easily turn to a corner. You can see why. It is important to keep in mind that the increase in budget increase from bill to bill and the extra charge from budget to bill is, unfortunately, a rule rather than an exception. For 22 years, expenses have increased from bill to bill. Thus, expenses are likely to be considerably higher than placed in the bill. Because the bow is very excited about government expenses, there is little room to change income resources and to sharpen income balance roles directly to taxes. Government expenditures will increase by 55.8 billion in 2019, about 1 billion per week, according to the bill. Government expenditures per Iceland has never been higher, measured on solid prices, and are publicised to one of the most developed countries. Out of 100 bucks. which will exist in the economy is a hundred and thirty-eight. Officially and clearly, the problems of public business are lacking in priorities rather than on funding. It\'s coming even. ... ina review of the Association of Professional Affairs on the budget bill. The bill is interesting, but a short chapter on page 20. Ninety-nine, which bears the heading: Economic uncertainty issues. That\'s where even the two of them come from. up to 40% of the 400 largest businesses in the country believe that employment conditions will get worse within the next six months, but only 7% believe that they will be better. Information on the staff has already begun. Despite warnings from different directions, the State Department and the government spending are still being added to the highest levels. So, according to the financial bill, there\'s no way to see that there\'s any concern for the future, it\'s at least with limited doses. Travel service has become our most important profession and represents less than 42% of the country\'s export price. Clearly, then, this article would have a profound bearing on national affairs. Already the arrival of foreign tourists has diminished. It is therefore essential that there be a pattern analysis of its effect in the event of a strong contraction. Hence, there is no priority, and it must be considered a significant part of the government\'s financial administration, especially in view of the scope of the travel service at the State\'s income - income level. The budget bill assumes that the state\'s debt and interest payments will continue to decline. It is a pleasure to see the success that has been achieved in these matters, and many external factors have made significant difference in this regard. The share of gross domestic product is expected to be 31% at the end of the next year, with a debt ratio of up to 86% of GDP in 2011. Kingdom funds, however, are still very high, although they have reduced their debt. According to the budget bill, it will be estimated to be about 40 billion dollars. next year, a reduction of 26 billion from 2011. In terms of my third section, the government shows unnecessary irresponsibility by avoiding its objectives in a financial programme to put up with budgets by 1%. As part 3 shows, budgets should be in accordance with financial schemes, the government should respond at the latest to the 3rd. to meet our own laws and goals. The financial and economic secretary\'s letter to the financier, dated October 13th, shows that the bill was updated on the basis of data submitted since the protocol was completed in June. This should be the most important factor in the final income accounting of 2017, etc. In this regard it should be noted that the newly published government account for 2017 is published without the opinion of the State Accounting. Part 3 considers it sobering for the Council to think that it is not possible for the Council to give a decision and what the consequences may be. It must be a requirement for a government bill to be made so that it can be signed without a warning, since it makes clear to all the government funds and their arrangements. Everything else must be unacceptable. Criticism is that the government is going to finance change proposals for the budgetary bill because of changes in economic forecasts, as well as changes made by the government in the 2nd Environment. by carbon dioxide waste means of at least 4 billion jar. Section 3 seems to indicate that in the future the government will need to buy these receipts back at a much higher price, since it seems unlikely that Iceland will be able to stay within its releases. Part 3 is the opinion that the government needs to back up that this arrangement is reasonable for the future before any financial gain comes back from it. Mr. President. Iceland is a state of high taxes on a global scale. The number of tax increases in previous years is largely unmoved. A priority should be to retract the tax increases taken after the collapse of the bank. Last year, funding taxes were raised, while promising to reimburse the tax. There\'s no mention of such a reexamination in the budget bill. When the capital tax was taken up, the low tax rate was short with a broad tax factor. The tax stock is still wide, but the tax rate has doubled. The middle class stresss that as government debt declines rapidly, there is room to consider reducing taxes on people and businesses in the country, not increasing the nation\'s affairs, as the government is particularly interested in. I\'m going to go back next to the importance of paying down insurance. Icelandic tax returns are high in international comparison and second in the north, behind Norway. In an effort to close the budget, companies were raised after the 2008 financial collapse. However, many of these changes have been established since then. The government\'s failure to cut down the insurance fee has been severe, but it will result in 14.4% of the government\'s income market next year. A third of my things express disappointment that the budget does not provide more insurance reduction than it does. High insurance costs are worst for companies where pay and pay-or-remuneration are largely expensive. High insurance costs undermine the competitiveness of these companies. The improved competitiveness of Iceland is very important, and especially now the economy is slowing down rapidly. In the government covenant, the reduction in insurance costs is particularly stressed, but it is not enough. About that, there is also a difference between the two of us. The industrial organization concluded. Despite the abolition of the insurance bill by 0.25%, it is calculated that the insurance bill accounts for over 100 billion dollars. The next year, a trust fund that is more than it is this year. The explanation is that salary has gone up. So the government gets more in the box, despite the reduction. As we know, the insurance bill is a special price paid by the remunerationpayers, i.e. Enterprises, should be paid by the sum of their entire salary. In recent years, the competition of international enterprises towards foreign rivals has deteriorated because of domestic costs measured in foreign currency. This trend is now evident in the less valuable production of exports and enterprises on the national markets that compete with foreign companies. For the 2008 economic collapse, the bail bill was 5.34%, but it was promoted to 8.655% following it. The increase was thought of as a temporary operation to cover a huge increase in expenses due to sudden unemployment. The premise for the rise and the evidence that was then used to raise the price back then no longer applies because unemployment has been very low for a long time, but September 1, 2000. it was only 2.3%. Iceland\'s Common Association has supported the importance of returning an increase in insurance. So it is a wonder that governments have been reluctant to cut down their insurance fees. The fact is, however, that the tax paid has increasingly been used to finance other financial expenses. For the decline to serve the aim of promoting a workforce balance and that next year\'s pay increases will be less effective in inflation, it should be much more than 0.25%. The pay is calculated as a percentage of the salary paid by the company to its employees. The more dollars the company pays in pay, the more money it will be paid in terms of insurance. The higher the insurance bill, the more expensive the employee is for his company. The higher the percentage, the less pay, the less the company can live up to. The price reduces the ability of an enterprise to invest and create jobs. Therefore, private companies\' growth potentials are blocked by high insurance costs. The central category conveys the change proposal to the bill that the loyalty rate reduces by 0.5% next year instead of 0.25%, as the bill puts it. When the adjustment is made, the pay will fall from 6.85% to 6.35%. It is reasonable to assume that these taxes will be no greater than they were before a collapse when the level of employment was comparable to ours. The government\'s budget estimates are that the pay will be restored in 2020, with another 0.25%. In spite of this, a total of percentages will still be missing that the insurance bill will be the same proportion of corporate pay as it was for the financial breakdown. The bill says that taking effect on the reduction of the insurance bill by 0.25% next year is negative to the state budget of about 4 billion dollars. So some people might conclude that a decrease of 0.5% would mean a decrease in income for a trust fund of 8 billion dollars. It is not because the decrease makes it easier for companies to hire new employees and to do better with the existing ones, which, in turn, increases tax revenues in the state\'s funds. Thus, the benefits of a careful reduction of the budget are great, and especially when difficult speech is yet to come. I\'m going to go to the carbon tax next and to what the Central Party thinks isn\'t equal to the population in a fair way. It\'s a new tax in Iceland. The bill shows that in 2019 C.E., income of carbon is estimated to be 5.9 billion. The price has already increased by 50% in a very short time, since 2017. The taxes are not an earmark of direct action on climates, and only part of them flows there. In terms of less than 3 parts, the increase in pay is entirely excessive. An even further increase, 10%, next year is expected to result in 550 million state funds. K. in income, including side effects on value taxes. At this time, the carbon price will be about 11 k. Every litre of gasoline and 12.6 taps. on diesel. They increase the costs of fuel use especially in the country. It may be reasoned that by using the carbon bill, localisations are taxing more than others, since the electric accelerator is much easier in the capital area than in the region where infrastructures are much higher in the capital area. Nevertheless, electric car owners have complained that the infrastructure for electrical vehicles is not sufficiently satisfactory in the capital, much less in the country. The internal structure is simply too far off. In addition, inhabitants of the country use a much larger amount of vehicles driven by fossil fuels, drive more because of their distance, and thus buy more fuel. It is normal that as a result of the rise in carbon taxes, the charges and taxes on environmental activity are reduced if the objective is to reduce pollution. Not so, though. The main objective of carbon costs is to encourage both homes and businesses to reduce emissions by switching to cleaner energy. First, it is by no means possible for anyone to switch to an electric vehicle, and second, the rest of the vehicle is still suitable in the country. First, it draws near to the limit of the automobiles and the number of loading stations. Thus, the contribution of carbon is different to the population of the capital and to the inhabitants of the region. So there is, in fact, a difference in currency between these groups. Thus, the tax suffers the relatively worst in terms of the income and the inhabitants of the country. Energy exchange encouragement is a good price price, but it has to be in line with reality. Energy exchanges for fishing companies, industry, and employment equipment are not yet practical. The carbon tax has a direct economic effect on the economy. Without any counterweight measures, the tax weakens the economy and reduces the competitiveness of an enterprise. Ideas are noble, but governments must give careful consideration to the purpose, basis, and goal of the tax system, especially whom they are taxing and whom they are not. The aim of the expenditure is to reduce emissions without diluting the competitiveness of work life and should be the same in this country. Thus, in other countries other taxes have been declined against the price or were given by other taxes. Iceland is, for example. One State in Europe where the fishing fleet has no access or is fortified with fuel taxes. This will further reduce competitiveness. Iceland\'s employment agency has researched domestic expenses, and it shows that fuel use is somewhat larger in rural areas. The difference reflects the fact that the population of the country has to travel more long distances. The financial and economic minister has acknowledged the greater impact of carbon costs on rural population. This is shown in the reply of a secretary to a request from the Council recently. Thus, in fact, carbon costs are a classic tax increase for people and companies where taxation comes down in the country. So that new tax burden is not leveled on the population in a fair way. In addition, the Environment Minister has said that the exact results of the cost measured in less emissions are difficult to assess. This was shown in the reply of a minister to a inquiry at the General Assembly. No initiatives are being proclaimed on the bills related to the budget that meet the country\'s settlements for the price. In addition, it is not apparent that environmental activity will not be involved or that other taxes will be reduced to counterweight. Changes in carbon charge are tax increases, dressed in green tax. It would be reasonable, then, to reduce the cost of other environmental factors. We must also look to other countries in that regard. In Denmark, the government did so. too soon when they raised taxes on the environmental issues of companies. In Norway, carbon costs are lower than Iceland and, in part, reimburse certain conditions. The level of carbon costs must not increase the cost of Icelandic enterprises beyond that of foreign competitors. This reduces competitiveness, reduces the share of the Icelandic enterprises and thereby the means to invest. At the same time, the likelihood that the price will be met reduces the likelihood that the cost will be met. What further reduces competitiveness is that non-employment tax obligations in this country are the exception of the carbon tax. Thus, foreign ships that take oil in this country do not have to pay the price, but in some cases they are fishing in the same way that they do. Neither a fishing ship, a cruise ship, nor a cruise ship pay carbon charge for fuel consumption here on the land, nor any carbon tax is paid by local air fuel in the state\'s funds. Although technological development is rapid in this sector, larger vehicles, workers, and some industrial instruments are not available to use renewable energy. It belongs, for example. We\'re in the ground sector and agriculture. Thus, energy exchange is not yet practical, especially for industry and employment equipment that use so - called colored oil. The possibilities of such parties for energy exchange are negligible. The amount of carbon is a tax that variously affects the sector\'s sector, and it is reasonable that the overall policy in the case should be taken before continuing. Thus, the central category suggests that an increase in carbon pay in the 10% budget will not be carried out and there will also be a 50% rise in the rate of pay dropped from 2017 until the total policy for how Iceland will use carbon expenditures in the battle of climate change without the loss of the land range or competitiveness of industry and will reduce its efficiency in the economy. The state\'s budget for this is estimated to be 2.3 billion, but to meet it, the bank\'s own money will be reduced in the form of interest to the state\'s funds. The reduction in carbon dioxide costs will reduce inflation pressure with a reduction in fuel price. Next, I will initiate a chapter of the Committee opinion about the special savings and the resources in force, the payment of mortgages on that subject, and the purchase of apartments. Paying down debt is an effective means of detriment and of having governments at any given time trying to create situations that encourage apartment owners to pay off debts at the best. By paying on an apartment loan with additional pension savings, the individual earns taxes and counterpayers, as well as reduces the overall interest rates and compensations. This has been an important tool that includes the tax-free provision of special savings to the apartment purchases and the head seat of the housing bar. Information from the Pension Funds has made significant use of this option. According to government taxpayer\'s records, over 6,500 people have applied for this process of buying at their first apartment. In October it was. was borrowed from nearly 3,000 people, and in the same month 408 applications were received. As I mentioned, that\'s why it\'s used considerably. In terms of domestic purchases, those who have taken advantage of this resource have been able to obtain special tax-free money for an apartment. The head position of the housing bar has been permitted to pay up to 4% of the recruiter\'s contributions and 2% of the payer\'s contribution, at a maximum of 500,000 bucks. A year for an individual and 750,000 a year. each year for married couples, or for others who qualify for a similar taxation. In recent years the prices of property in this country have gone up substantially. The supply of other apartments is by no means demand. Most underlying factors thus indicate that the value of real estate in the highest places does not fall quickly. In spite of this, the government has decided to drop authority on the use of property savings to the expense and subsidies of apartment loans. This is shown in the bill on page 18. 114 and will take effect in the middle of the year 2019 or next year. Mr. President. The Central Party believes that this is an unwise arrangement to discuss with the government. In addition, the collection of special property savings will be greatly reduced rather than the possibility of increasing the sources of this savings. The task force appointed by the prime minister in June 2017 to review the role of pension funds in the building of employment life was simply stressing increasing the scope of special property and housing savings. The group returned a more difficult report at the beginning of this year. The service group suggests that the minimum pay in pension money will be raised from 12% of pay to 15.5%, that governments look into agreement with stakeholders for a change of law in order to provide additional permission for extra pensional savings as well as that funds partners can include 3.5% of the 15.5% of the minimum legal fees in their private interest or housing savings at their choice. In addition, loyalty becomes the flexibility of funds partners in order to use their special savings to cover mortgages and/or pay for an apartment. Calculations have shown that individuals who place 15.5% of their income in the pension fund all their lifetimes will accumulate relatively successful pensions. With additional pensions, pension can become more than a job. Thus, the staff suggests that governments look at additional sources of special savings and use the pay - related pension money to provide housing supplies. The decision of the government to cut down the overall resources on the assessment by the centres of property savings, to buy an apartment, or to pay off mortgages, on the contrary to the suggestions of the task force, is a real disappointment. Therefore, the Central Party suggests that the provision of the EU budget is to be implemented indefinitely when the directive is to expire in my next year. Mr. President. Next time, I\'m going to move on to housing and development. The government boasts that the total housing support is 25.5 billion. This support is largely at the demand side of the apartment market, e.g. 9.6 billion interest and housing improvements. It cannot be seen that the government is dealing with the housing problems here with practical solutions. The experience in recent years clearly shows that this method is not successful. Support to demand side increases prices and encourages fluctuations. There is a need for extra housing. This, in turn, results in a decrease in housing prices. Tremendous increases in shelter prices in recent years are mainly due to lack of housing. A small supply means a higher price. Though the government puts more money on interest, there is no increase in market market markets. It must take action against the root of the problem, a lack of open housing. Plenty of housing is a lower price. Governments are expected to take measures to reduce construction costs. The reductions in construction costs produce additional incentives for building. As a result, the supply increases and prices begin to decline. Sadly, the planning is far too hovered in that sector. Although the simple design of the building industry needs to be increased, complex regulations and requirements increase the time and cost of living in the country\'s construction, as well as the incomprehensible nature of the language environment. The government needs to support the rural areas in the process. The period of construction must be shortened, e.g. by using an amulet to a greater degree, from wood or concrete, where it is rapid and simple. The bill shows that interest improvements are to be increased by 13% between years and 3.4 billion in this category. Yet, there is a modest amount of history. The huge increase in housing prices over the past few years has eaten up the interest improvements. One of the primary components of growth growth is an increase in value of property. Other factors also have an effect, such as increase in pay and money income. Since 2010, interest improvements have dropped by more than 8 billion. and the families entitled to them dropped by 30,000. So a lot of people have been replaced. So there is no real treasure flow in this campaign of improvement. At the same time, food supplies to landlords have dropped to a great extent as the tax on homeowners have gone up considerably. What\'s important about this is the limit of limits, i.e. when growth improvements begin to decline. In no way have growth reforms and degradation limits been correlated with prices. In addition, peak interest rates have remained almost the same since 2011. In 2009, 69% of the single property owners received interest, and in 2017 that number was down to 28%. As a result, the cut off-off marks of growth reforms must be adjusted. You can\'t see there\'s a place in the bill so that you don\'t have a student. Growth reform guidelines remain stable. The terms of interest rates and peak growth improvements increase by 5% and net share by 10% from current year. If the rules cannot be changed, this foretold increase in growth is meaningless. The growing reform system as it is today does not serve its purpose. Adding money to such a system is a bad provision. The growing reform system today does not expect higher housing prices and raise interest costs. Such a system is, in fact, useless, especially in the conditions in which the housing market in this country has been in recent years, Iceland has the largest increase in global housing prices, 70% in the last five years. The panorama fund points out that growth improvements can be achieved to contribute to the national security in view of the current situation. It is evident, therefore, that this is not the case with the State\'s increased spending. It may be reasoned that the results may even get worse while housing availability is not increasing. Increase in growth may thus increase the value of housing. The central category believes that there will be an overall review of the growth reform system, which demonstrates clearly the negative development that has taken place in recent years. Today\'s growth reform system tends to increase the interest rate, which involves subsidies of capital costs. In addition, it is known that reforms encourage debt. Careful consideration should be given to the effectiveness of falling from the system in the present image and in other ways to reduce tax burden. The current system supports the demand side of the housing market and is designed to raise the value of real estate. Expansion and the arrangements made by the government do not increase the number of apartments on the market, which we clearly see here on the country, as I mentioned earlier. It is necessary and more specific to support the forward side. Recent Swedish and American studies have shown that by supporting the forward side, i.e. having the incentive to increase the number of buildings, would reduce housing prices, the number of apartment owners, and the debt of tenants would be reduced. If this route were to take place in a country considered by the Central Party to be a good reason to look at it, the current growth reform system would be reduced. It\'s a lot to work on new routes when it comes to housing, since our present system does not solve the big housing problem in Iceland. The government must take initiative in housing and bring new solutions. This is one of the biggest solutions we are facing. Sadly, the government has little to do with the important issue. It does not reveal any new ideas or solutions; it preserves only growth reform systems that maintain the problem. Mr. President. I\'m just gonna step aside to my character discounts and child benefits. In recent years, expenses for child reform have been greatly reduced. There is therefore plenty of room to raise base height without increasing the percentage of decrease. The support of children\'s families has diminished in recent years, and children\'s benefits have been lost. The bill expects an increase in personality beat and child improvement. However, it must be said, as it is, that it is by no means the cup implied. Over the past few years, thousands of Icelanders have not been eligible for child support or interest support because restrictions and downlinks have been taking place for years. The bill accounts for a 1.6 billion rise in child improvement, about 16%. In the face of increasing child - rearing rates, and in view of experience, we are expected to get into the same environment soon, despite an increase. A question is, Should a child\'s ability to consider what is best for him? Whether an increase in personality discount could be of even greater benefit and should be more targeted. Is it worthy of research? Next time, I\'m going to step in on older people\'s affairs. It is undeniably true that the terms of the elderly who have least of their hands are in no harmony with the general standard of living in the country. The ones with no money but the pensions of social security are the worst. Pension levels have steadily subsidized. According to the bill on basic insurance pensions, only increasing 3.4% next year. In the 69th. law on social security says that improvement should take into account pay development, although improvements will never increase less than the prices of the index price. The government covenant says that the position of those who are walking in their way needs to be made firm. These include older citizens who have limited or no rights from pensions and who do not engage in paid jobs. In such cases, most people have to rely solely on the pension of social security and are many of them in a public rented or even in debt. This includes those who have not earned full social security rights for living abroad, e.g. immigrants. In the spring months, the Department of Social Affairs appointed a group of members to consider the interest of older ones in order to gain a better perspective on the different circumstances in which older citizens live and to offer suggestions on how to improve their situation. The group has not yet returned their suggestions, but they were to be returned on November 1. and, of course, should have yielded earlier, so the suggestions for the financial process could be discussed. The older citizen\'s money took the initiative that the staff were appointed. The Society has repeatedly directed the government on the need to correct pensions. The company of older citizens is taking their minds to represent the local community. Since 2010, pay has increased more than 11% more than pensions. So the pension should be less than 267,000 bucks. every month instead of 239,500 k. for tax. The difference is 27,000 K. That amount is certainly remembered by those who spend a month and by those who have little time between hands. On the other hand, all of us realize that this amount is not enough for forward. The number of older citizens who are concerned about their financial situation is more than 30%. It\'s coming even. magazines in a survey made two years ago by Reykjavíkurburg, the Ministry of Health and the older citizens\' National Association. Recently, at a meeting of the budget committee, the Fégagi of older citizens gave careful suggestions on how to improve the prospects of the worst set up in that group. For those suggestions, thanks. They are practical, and they want a third-mind to encourage the government to respond to the suggestions and take them seriously. According to OECD figures, there is a lower percentage of national production and wages in Iceland for the payment of pension than in countries such as Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Sweden. Icelanders generally go to pensions later than the citizens of other countries, and there is a much greater and longer rate of employment involved in Iceland than in the rest of the countries. In this country, there is a 50% employment program, which includes only a 20% sector in Sweden, which is the same age group. Comparison with the above countries shows that Iceland differs from an active pension age. Icelanders usually take a pension one to two years after a public pension date is reached, but in the other four countries, people usually go to pension some time before the official age is reached. Thus, Icelanders usually spend far less years than usual in other countries. Thus, payment from both parts of the pension system usually begins in the country later. The average country\'s age is lower, so the public system\'s pension load is still very low in comparison. This emphasizes that governments have and are to take steps to treat older citizens well. This is the generation that we most owe to today\'s general well - being, a generation that broke out in poverty with hard work and hard work, a generation that is only asking for justice and having the privilege of living in decent terms. Studies in older citizens have shown that nearly everyone, or 97%, feels that it would be easier for those who are in pensions to be more active at the job market. The older citizens\' employment program brings them greater activity in the community. Increased activity contributes to the well - being and satisfaction of life and the more active elderly, the more joyful life - styles they experience. The government must be aware of this. They must be aware of the status, expectations, and attitudes of the elderly when it comes to job participation and its positive effects on the well - being of older citizens. Older citizens are more physically active today than ever before, people can expect to live longer, and therefore they need to be in touch with the elderly so that they remain active in society and remain independent for as long as possible. Those interested and able to work longer should have further opportunities with greater flexibility on the retirement process and on the job after start of pension. Older staff often have a lot of knowledge and experience that can be useful in many work areas and that is both useful for those who want to remain in the workforce as well as for the rest of the community. Research has shown that association can bring great satisfaction to older people. The central category has emphasized the importance of removing income benefits from senior remuneration and moving the category to change proposals for budgetary support that the income of older citizens does not interfere with pension pay. A few years ago, the research site of the store investigated its effect on government funds if senior citizens were to be increased and if the amount of age-related benefits were not affected by the person\'s pay. The conclusion is that a government fund will profit from further tax returns. If income support of an older citizen\'s compensation was taken, it would encourage them to reenter the labour market on an increased scale. There is a lack of workforce in this country, such as in trading and services, and it has had to be brought into large numbers of foreign workers. Many of these work may be performed by older citizens. Older citizens are to be able to participate in a workforce individually without having to take on the loss of pensions. It improves their quality of life and provides national benefits. Next, I\'m going to intervene in the affairs of the disabled and the new laws on the user - controlled type of personal assistance. In the spring months, the General agreed to serve with disabled people with long - term needs, law No. 38/2018. Laws allow, in fact, the type of so-called MPA agreements, contracts for the user-controlled personal assistance for disabled persons. The law involves a great act of justice for the disabled. By making a contract of user-controlled personal assistance, the user receives payment instead of services. The user will personally handle the job, decide what he wants to do, and use his assistants. As of October 1 you could apply for NAPA services. The government pays 25% with each contract, while the companies pay 75%. This is an expensive resource. The service is changing from establishment to individual service. In some cases, it takes up to four or five employees to care for this new arrangement for one person. The law has established the right of the disabled to obtain this service at all costs. Of course, that is a great act of justice, but there must be money to render the ministry. The rural population also needs to keep out the measures they had previously used and used, such as cohesives, because the NPA individual has the right to return, e.g. In a home, he wishes it. This is all at the expense of rural society, a significant increase in government services, but the cost is 3/4. It seems to be a rule rather than an exception that enough money from the State does not follow up with the moving assignments from a country to the countryside. On page 18. The bill 383 shows that a contribution to the user - controlled personal assistance is only 70 billion. K. next year. It is not yet clear how many contracts to make and at any time or at any time in the financial affairs of the rural community. The protocol to explain the implementation is not yet completed at the Ministry. Thus, rural society has not been able to establish its rules. The rural population has expressed concern about the high cost of applying this new form of service and has requested that the law\'s execution be postponed. Clearly, the contribution of the State to the year 2019 is by no means at all. A smaller increase in disability in the bill presented here is 1,100 million. K. ... andisa real surprise. The chairman of the financier has stated that the change is due to the planned changes in social security in order to improve the quality of disability later than expected. It does not show what caused delay in the induction of a new food supply system, and it is very unfortunate that this work cannot be completed on the part of the government and changes would be established for the years so that the increase would fully be fully implemented in the new year. This community group that is reminded of not having to wait for their release in this way because of the poor task management of social security to complete important work on a new food and forwarding system. The differences within the government on this matter are not to be taken out of the way for micro-terrestrials to be taken. ▪ Government should not ask poor people in Iceland to wait for justice. These are familiar words; those are the words of Prime Minister Katrín, the daughter of Jakobsdóttir, at the General of September, then a member of the administrative body. Mr. President. The Central Party proposes a change in the bill in order that, due to the reduction in donations to poverty, a sum of 1.1 billion dollars per cent, as stated in the budget bill, will be postponed at the new production of Husseður. I don\'t remember that amount 800 million. At a point, and 300 million. K. will be in the form of interest from the state\'s banks. In total, this will be 1,100 million, and it will be used to pay microspheres from time to time next year as planned. Next, I\'m going to go to a chapter in the heading entitled ""Report the Kingdom Ministry as Never Before. "" The financial bill gives evidence that the government\'s list of projects is not the top priority. There goes the leading member of the Independence Party, which has regularly cried out loud for elections: Drive away. Then, when the pack reaches power, the stall continues to grow. ▪ We need to clean up our financial affairs and reduce the state\'s perspective, as the secretary of finance said in 2010. A minister is now offering a financial bill that is still being added to the State Department. There is no intention of saving the government by uniting or destroying government agencies. A few years ago, the independent party had much to do with the government\'s banking business. ▪ Perfectly unnecessary, the members of Congress said. The Senator went so far as to criticize him that he maligned the Agency and that putting it down was a national agreement. Well, eight years later, the Independence Party still lives in the Bank Office, bringing her 60 million on the budget bill for 2019. In addition, the government itself, with all its helpers and 636 million each year, has met an increase of some 175 million each year. The UN Committee is a fixed segment, as is usual on budget, with 114 million receiving this government slot next year, and it has been living for 20 years. Another year, we get 30 million climates to hold meetings, and so on. The cost of division by the Ministry of Health for 2 Ministry, Health Ministry and Department of Social Affairs is less than 212 billion. K. This is indicated by a further increase in the Ministry to 345 million. K. Increase the staff by seven. It does not show that this arrangement is reasonable or that it yields benefits to the State. In addition, it may be asked, "" Would the cost have not been better spent by the clients of the Ministry of Health? \' It was evidently found that the interests of many afflicted citizens would have benefited them if money had been spent directly in their behalf. It may refer to microbubbles and a group of older citizens who are expected to live under the Ministry\'s forward guidelines. An increase to the Ministry of State accounts for between 1.7 billion years, 11.7%. An increase to a level of nearly 0.5 billion per year, of which 160 million are involved in visas in India and in the United States. A further increase of 182 billion is seen in the perfusion proposed by the largest part. K. The rise in defense is now over 300 million, of which 50 million are engaged in military exercises. Of course, it is very interesting under the seat of the left green in the government. There\'s a budget up to 50 million on the bill. K. for the prehumanity of Iceland in the North Pole. It may be asked if the Ministry can\'t be better used in the prefect and whether a head needs special funding on this matter. There are 836 million special funding for Schengen implementation showing that it is long time to consider the pros and cons of this system and cooperation for Iceland. Increase to Environment Ministry totals 2 billion and 55 million. K., corresponding to 11.8%. Then I saw in the redundant paper an even further increase of 182 million. The same can be said for the financial and economic sectors, it goes up by 2 billion and 37 million. K., which corresponds to 9.2%. Of these, there is an increase in the affairs of the State budget of 525 million. Then there was an extra reserve in a change of 153 billion. K. In recent years, there has been no great economy in the Council of Government. It is long time to attack the public system and reduce the public activity. In addition, it is unwise to add still to the Kingdom display, where it is difficult and painful to do so, it may be possible to unwind an expansion if the government\'s earners fail. Government priority needs to be better. Ideas about the unity of the FDA and the Federal Bank, for example, should include economic management. Interestingly, during the days when the united plans were presented, it was specifically noted that there was no way to reduce the number of employees. It\'s the wrong approach. Unions should include saving to taxpayers. In addition, the pay in the budget has increased largely over the past few years and is high in relation to the private sector. The increase in budgets beyond the general price increase is rule rather than exception. Thus, the government has constantly been more expensive to taxpayers. That\'s the way it is, for example. Increasing costs for state surveillance. The bill has little country support requirements. The Independence Party now known to represent the Ministry of Economics and Economics has the capacity to handle this situation, as he has so many sermons. Rather, he adds to the Kingdom display as never before. Mr. President. There are other things I\'m going to come in on. I see my time is getting shorter. I would especially like to mention the agriculture, perhaps later in a talk about how uninterested the government is about the economy. We can see that in the changes made by most of the stocks, agrienvironment schemes or agricultural management have increased by 108 million. As a result, they are in almost a drawer of the Department of Employment and are very sad. I\'m finally going to enter some more adjustment proposals proposed by the Central Party. In this regard, we offer extra funds to promote home service, home care, and health care of the elderly in order to meet the waiting lists among the elderly to get into a nursing home. The suggestion is that there are 200 million people to strengthen their communities to promote home - care services and home care for the elderly and 70 million to the national health care unit to increase the health supplies of the elderly. In addition, we have a suggestion to improve our effectiveness in the important work of OSI. The proposal goes on to make a special contribution to the U.S.A. up to 125 million. K. and 50 million to meet cutbacks for financial contributions to the cancer club. [[The president calls.]] In addition, we have an arrangement that I recommend to further the work of customs, which is in the transition form. [[The president calls.]] Then we have a final suggestion to fight social security, and it is put forward here on a change of the box. [[The president calls.]] [[The president calls.]] To say that, Mr. President, for the sake of time, I have to finish my case now, but I\'ll be in this discussion later.', 'Mr. President. We\'ll discuss some suggestions on the greater part of the 2nd. the financial bill and the concern of our minor people of that kind were expressed by many of them, at least. Here were a few things, we in the smaller parts have chosen to make a common adjustment, but we each have a different opinion. After the continuous improvement of the state funds each year since 2009 and in 2013, the trend has been relatively slow between 2014 and 2015. A positive conclusion is primarily based on irregular teams such as unusually large financial contributions owned by the State. The results of 2016, for example, are watched to produce some of the newcomers, are similar, even worse than the rest. This trend in terms of continued and continuous economic improvement since 2011 is of concern. State funds have been systematically weakened in this government\'s history, allowing a total of at least 3,500,4 billion dollars. However, the economic situation of the country gives us an opportunity and opportunity to strengthen society\'s infrastructure and well - being. The forwarding party government and the Independence Party do not treat this opportunity, as it were, in the left green. In common proposals of the government, it can be seen that other emphasis can be placed on the government of the country, if it is needed, and if possible, more reasonablely make better use of the funds of the state. It highlights improvements in public interest and in the lowest income, health care, culture, education, and investments in the environment and in countries all over the country. In this way we believe that it will be best to counteract injustice in Iceland and to ensure that more prosperity will be divided justly. The 2016 budget was set aside on a total budget of 15.3 billion dollars. But the government\'s proposal to turn it down to 10.7 billion. The bill and the ensuing national financial programme still make it clear that the financial emphasis and financial policy of the government of an independent party and a forwarding party is making it in effect that the burdens of the richest group of citizens and those who are considering the material memory with an unfair distribution of the taxpayer and the exchange of public funds. It is a government policy that is characterized by great uncertainty about major factors involving both expenses and financial income. The impact of collective agreements is considerable. The government has chosen to issue large incomes where money is put aside or does not extend it, lower hunting costs, pay tax on middle level, reduce tolls, decrease tolls, drop the upper level of credits, and reduce tax prices, whereas food taxes were raised, and it is repealed to reduce insurance costs to some degree. This emphasis is surprising, especially in view of the fact that, at the same time, there is a huge array of budgetary categories. As we have seen, we have talked about health, social security, education, transportation, and much more. It is a financial policy that is built up in the new world, and uncertainty is an irresponsible and unjust policy that is most useful to major people and rich men than low - paying people, poorer and older citizens in the country, and the account for the lack of investments in the interiors of society is sent into the future. The product of the fiscal bill is based on starving money - torn national agreements, even though long ago external circumstances have been more economical. When it comes to working on the budget bill, it is very important that we do well, for that is the largest case in the winter, and it must ensure that the public\'s trust in the provision of funds from the state\'s budget is given. I find that there are some things to be critical of, including... lack of agreement with the council and therefore stated the crucial agreements of the government of Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson Gunugason on the stability of fallen financial companies instead of stable taxes. The stability progress is presented as one of the basics of the GDP, although it has yielded much less than has been presented in various financial ministers and prime minister displays and is completely unexploited, both in next year\'s budget and in the financial policy. Not to be overlooked is the work as a greater part of the budget committee for the exclusive joint, the so - called curator, as I spoke to the chairman of the legal committee in return. In fact, a greater proportion of budgetary committees are assigned hundreds of millions of dollars, to their own appetites, to museum members assigned to do in a uniform, professional, and transparent manner. During the last terms, this was changed, including due to the indications of Government Accounters and members of all categories who have been subject to special favors to those who have access to legal committees. These are the opinions that came along, and that\'s why they started changing them. As an example of old - fashioned practice, the making of more than 240 million is distributed in a number of types of projects that actually belong to museum members. In this context, there are tasks set up in 285 million, but these have not been discussed in the Committee and no evidence has been provided, at least not in our audience, the memory of the stock board. In itself, it has nothing to do with the work being done there. It would be almost to strengthen urban and application programmes where local people set priorities for professional processes. The general public must be able to trust that money is distributed in a professional, transparent way, not according to individual senators. The main frustrations are, however, that this is a budget that I find free of all future vision when it comes to the future development of community infrastructure, economic sustainability, maintenance and growth of society\'s infrastructure, responsible environmental policies and trustworthy solutions to the very sensitive state of the European economy both in the present and in the future. It\'s only about the budget. The budget is estimated to drop only about 11.5 billion to 2019 and, however, will remain virtually unchanged to that year or about 68 billion years of 2017 and 2018. Under the budget of 2015, i.e. This year, interest costs are expected to reach more than 82.5 billion, drop to more than 77 billion, according to the bill\'s status on budget 2015, but decline to 72.6 billion under the bill for 2016 and change and remain unchanged until it falls to less than 63 billion dollars. in 2019 C.E. In this regard it should be noted that in 2015 reevaluation interest rate is expected to be less than 6 billion below the budget of 2015. This decrease was explained to most of the less effective projections this year than by budgeting which, among other things, affects government interest, government stocks, and bonds at Iceland\'s Secret Bank. Thus, in view of government\'s cortical declarations to lower interest rates, the decrease in interest of interest seems to be small, and appears to be largely explained by the pay of debt to the Bank of Iceland, i.e. ... about5 billion. A key requirement for increasing debt subsidies is plans to make use of part of the resurgence, stability tax, or the Sensian currency supply to pay up 103.5 billion posts of the state\'s debt to the Sentencing Bank. Stability progress, i.e. The agreement of the Foreign Government and the Independence Party with the demands of the fallen financial companies, which we recall was presented with a corneal presentation in Darp in June. is critical, both misleading and convening with the Council on the issue that has been negligible throughout the term. By the stability process, the Government of Sigmundur, the Davíð of Gunnlaugsson, gave up a huge sum of incomes that pay up to a 39% stable tax on the well - being by offering taxes on the tax if they do not have to pay within the specified period. It also gives thought to the yielding agreement between the government and the foreign requirements for interest and can be seen in the publication of the head of the state taxation of the 172 suit. 175, about the change in income tax laws, the tax laws for special taxes on financial companies and financial law. It says, by permission of the president: ▪ In terms of the state taxpayer\'s opinion, the controversial legal adjustment proposal will only solve the problem of growing interest to foreign recipients - unsolved would be the problem left over by national demands and standards required by law No. 94/1996.156 A large group of demands will therefore be replaced by the agreement with an independent party and a forwarding party, which is much better for the demands than the government had. In this way government funds and at the same time the public will be less detracted than by the stable tax route, and uncertainty continues to determine when the public and pension funds will be released from capital capital capitals. Although the government has made it a goal to sell up to 30% of its property at Iceland\'s National Bank, it is not expected to profit from its sales under the bill. That must be an unusual plan in the light of the written status of the company and the prospect of the future. The high value of money also does not contribute to subsidies, although it is intended to defend the value of payment. This uncertainty with the trade process of the Lands Bank does not have to be surprising, since one of the members has concluded against the bank\'s sale at its last national meeting, so there must be considerable uncertainty about the outcome of the case. The left movement ◯ Green supply violates the sale of this object of various causes, including that the bank gives its owner considerable gains, but also because while the state has as much power on the banking system as it is now, there are great opportunities to jump up the system, separate business and investment banks, and organise sound banking systems into the future. I remind you that council members of the left movement have presented a matter of understanding business and investment banking. A 20% reduction in total debt is expected to be due to gross domestic product at the end of 2019. The decline in debt ratio can be largely attributed to growth in domestic product production, as its value is estimated to increase by 29% over the period. The value of the debt is also expected to drop by approximately 15% over the period due to sale of shares in the Lands Bank and a debt bill at the Sports Bank as it has been traced. Thus, to a small extent the government\'s public business will pay off the serious concern of the debt, that the underlying business is still not good enough. Although the economy is on the right, it is very sensitive. Sadly, labour market conflicts have marked all this terms. In the light of history, it is not surprising that countries are uncertain about the effect of collective agreements. Worst of all, in the present government, there has been a lack of contracts with a working class that has rightly looked for pay corrections and with more vision and agreement will likely could have been met in a way that was not done with the length of conflicts, strikes, and repeated legalizations on employees that have not been shown for decades. The secretary of the budget recognizes the uncertainty factor due to new labour agreements and their impact on the economy, as shown on page 6. 6 policy and outlook, where it is based on the hope that good cooperation will be achieved between the labour market partners and the government. We know that it seems that those less modest among the hands who have called for reform should make sure that stability is maintained. Despite the uncertainty, the fiscal bill asserts that by reducing tax burden, increasing employment, and increasing wages, the increase in the growth in provisional incomes in the country\'s households will continue to increase. It is important to keep in mind that the promises of the current government on the above measures are far from being implemented in favor of the public. Therefore, the government market suggests that social security pensions and pensions increase in the same way as pay in a general labour market, i.e. To the lowest-payers, 300sts. K. and that this goal will be met in 2017. The reduction in tax burden in the past has been most beneficial for businesses and big business and high-priority. It is important to note that in spite of the wonderful promises, the government brought its inconsistencies into agreements in the labour market contracts in the summer of 2015, likely to be remembered and to have government ministers repeatedly pointed out that the tax changes are involved in collective agreements and, as a result, almost overcomes criticism. To answer, it is possible to resort to other tax doctors in contracts with the labour market that would have been more supportive and less negative. It may be asked, "" Why did I not have to cut down my insurance fee? \' In the long term, the tax on pay is the tax paid by the insurance company. This decrease would thus have affected the entire pay record in contrast to the decline in tax rate, which has no effect on the lowest paying rate. The increase in pay is not automatic, however, the increase in financial gain, which makes it clear to the Bureau\'s standards of inflation that the purchase of funds is drawn immediately next year, if observed, from less than 8% this year to less than 7% next, to 5% in 2017 and to more than 3% in 2018. This is shown in Table 5 of the National Institutes of Money, which is known as the OCEAN, U.S.A. It also says that in 2016 inflation will reduce the rate of salary gain. The U.S. Penitentiary Committee has warned of a rapid worsening inflation ratings during the year, and it is most recently remembered that the bank\'s direct growth was increased by 0.5% in both June and July, and is now 5.5%. The meeting of the money conference committee since November 18th. it shows how sensitive the prospect of inflation is from collective agreements. The unsuspecting factors discussed in the November issue of money emphasize that the next three years\' worth of inflation could easily change from what is expected in the ground forecast. Priceal pressure may be underestimated, as it would otherwise require a higher interest level than the basic projection to keep aim - keeping inflation, if, for example, an enterprise is concerned by the expense of newly made collective agreements to a far greater extent than expected in the projection, or if the effects of a temporary increase in the amount of money available on private consumption and prices are underestimated. In the government\'s tax policy, the real political policy of the dominant government is reflected, for example, not only is the tax system needed to obtain money for social projects but the development of the tax system affects the whole community, whether it is divided tax burden, property, or income distribution. The left movement, therefore, suggests that the change in the step - change of the tax system and the tax declines involved. Further, government funds and funds are to be spent in promoting social infrastructure, such as the social standing of the worst in the community. Our proposals for the memory of the part show this. It is assumed that the government\'s arrangements for taxes will reduce the income of more than 7 billion next year and some 1,915 billion a year to 2019 C.E. We see that in the coming years, we are losing a substantial amount of money, which is very sensitive to society and government funds, which are just beginning to balance outside this irregular income. By means of a budget bill for 2016, the government of Independence Class and Progress continues in the same direction, giving up an important amount of money at a delicate time when the Icelandic economy is rising from the ruins of economic ruin. The present government is in charge of this bill in further changes in the tax system, all of which contribute to the greater inequities and detoxification of the richest part of the country and make the chemical memory more and more expensive to the combined expenses of all of us. This calls the government a simple tax system, but it is, of course, the policy and purpose of it to disappear from the income - trade tax system established by the former government to increase the equation. In fact, a minister of finance has been successful in his efforts if it is determined on the grounds of the NGO of low taxes and low cohesion. For 2015, the focus was primarily on the change in the value tax system and the lower tax steps were increased from 7% to 11%, as we shall remember. In spite of this, the minister of finance was still thinking about further expansion of the lower level, and he wanted to take it to 14%, and that is how it first appeared in the bill. A resistance to government opposition and labor movement prevented the rise, and these changes are the worst for those with the lowest income. As mentioned earlier, the government intends to further tax change, and it seems that the goal is to try to reverse all the income that the last government\'s tax reformed. It seems that it is the largest case of this government to try to reverse everything that was used to be done. Changes to the current government\'s high value tax and income tax as well as to the detriment of capital tax have already had a negative impact on the income balance. In addition, tax loss is completely out of harmony with the Court\'s repeated wishes that the government supports government\'s national financial policies in the bank\'s financial policies. The reduction in taxation, on the other hand, increases the likelihood that the bat will increase its growth in order to reduce demand. Further support against the government\'s tax system changes can be found in the opinion of the 1st lower part of the Economic and Business Committee on various grounds of budgetary laws. A lot of talk has been made about insurance bills and stocks. The share of the insurance bill that runs into the birth Oralfs Fund has fallen from 1.28 percentage points to 0.65. The ever larger portion of the insurance bill flows beyond the particulars of projects and it is not yet implemented how the funding of the stocks will be maintained, despite the well over a year being a social and housing minister ordered a committee to submit proposals for improvement in the funds status of the fund. It would be worth more than a section of the budget called for these suggestions to begin to be seen. In the joint proposals of the government, there is a suggestion that children\'s families will be brought up to 500 thousand roofs and child support will increase the impairment criteria. It is sobering to think of a time when the nations of the world are assembled at one of the most important climate conferences, and a united spirit prevails among them to reduce fossil fuel emissions is the focus of the Icelandic government to put off environmental and resource taxes that are one of the most powerful instruments the governments have in the fight for future generations when it comes to protecting the environment. However, there are neither many nor many resource taxes in this country; such taxes are mainly in a carbon tax paid in the state of liquid fossil fuels, such as gas oil, diesel, gasoline, airplane and jet fuel, and fuel fuel. While carbon costs are laid and charged by law, the high government of the Independence Party and the forwarding party was reduced by 1%. The same is true of gasoline charge, oil charge, and miles. These reductions in consumption of taxes, i.e. In my opinion, in my opinion, petal tax and tax returns were allowed on the part of the government to negotiate collective agreements and by the Government\'s declaration of their operations related to the Shrecking Mass in 2013. Like other tax reforms, the provision of the government\'s increased consumption and incentives, even at the same time, at the same time involving consumption as undisputed environmental damages, such as fossil fuels burning. The law on climate that is intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions accounts for the cost of emissions. It will, in view of the average price of emissions in the European Economic Area, as it is in a year period that ends on August 31, the previous year. This shows something other than the willingness to perform in terms of climate taxation. That\'s the law No. 125/2014, on various grounds of a bill to be funded for 2015, stipulated that income from available emissions flows into a state fund instead of a climate fund, which is intended to support projects that can help to narrow greenhouse gas emissions in Iceland, adapt to climate change and increase the public knowledge about climate change, its consequences, and the possible measures to cope with them. The obvious fact is that the income of a state\'s budget is being reduced in climates, allowing it to flow directly into a government fund, where it is not earmarked climates. To meet Iceland\'s commitments to climate crisis, the European Union has a common proposal for the increase of funds to be made to the green economy, public transport and to the climate fund. The tax system can be used to promote and improve human health and to prevent general health damage by preventive measures. Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the policy of the current government, as shown by its reduction in alcohol and tobacco charge, as well as the decision to eliminate the sugar tax on January 1, 2016. The consequences of too much sugar consumption are known to be seen in a variety of diseases and disorders that already affect people\'s health and will do so on an even greater scale in the future. These have been referred to as an epidemic when it comes to the incidence of so - called diabetes. Therefore, it is clear that, at the same time as the present government established a special government prime board on public health, its arrangements in terms of government matters should be aimed at reducing the taxes of insurmountable but raising the price of loyalty. Finally, despite the best - known public health and health ills in general, it will not be avoided to mention the proselytism of the Independence Party with its class leader on the increase in access to alcohol despite the best - known public health and health groups in general, not to mention the new-release policy of the government itself. A respectable president. It is impossible to avoid talking and writing about the income of the state\'s funds and deed in the long administration of an independent party and a forwarding party without referring to the enormous sums that the government gave off the state funds almost immediately by the 2013 administration of the change in fishing fee. Clearly, with changes in the fishing fee in the past of the present government, government funds have already been worth billions of dollars, and everything looks like they\'ll continue to decrease compared to the latest number from Fish Labs. These figures show that the reduction in fish fishing in 2012 and 2013 is less than 9 billion and, in effect, some larger in terms of annual prices. In general, the fishing costs during the last year are only less than 8 billion, and they do not remember much that the government was able to wipe out the full thought of a particular off - to - date fishing fee, which is on top of a general cost that takes into account the cost of major marine services. The same trend can be seen in the reduction of fishing costs in the 2015 budget, which is considered by the Ministry of Economic and Economic Affairs at more than 2 billion dollars. and is mainly attributed to adjustments in legal requirements, which better match their pressures over the fishing year, thus improving the pressure of the fish. During the 2015/2016 fishing year, a monthly fishing fee will be paid and due to the fishing of the second month. Thus, instead of largely placing the fees on the hands of the legislatures at the beginning of the fishing year and then collecting four equally paid days, such as the preparation in the fishing year 2014/2015. This results in a lower rate of fishing during the 2015 calendar year, with a higher rate of fishing in the next 2016 season. In this regard, the left movement reminds us of a green proposal that the government has dropped the fishing rate substantially since it received its administrations, as shown by a picture in my committee. It is proper to note that fishing costs have not been reduced because of the worsening of the fishing industry, which has been extremely good in recent years, but because of political government decisions. In this case, the use of a common resource will have to be considered peculiar priorities for the government to reduce the income of a government fund, at the same time as it cannot be financed in order to ensure that society\'s infrastructure is under way. The government budget is being offered, and it is referred to in the 2014 -2019 national forecast that public investment will reach its maximum in the current year and then decline rapidly in the coming years, as shown on page 5. 18 on bill for budgetation, policy and outlook. However, public investments are at the lowest level in history and would need to be increased even if only to make up for savings in the infrastructure from a financial breakdown. This financial bill, for example, does not provide the necessary funds for the road construction to promote and sustain our country\'s transport systems. Only small amounts of money are added to discuss the budget. This decision-making and distribution of public funds appears to be based on psychiatric decisions, unprofessional but not based on the calculated need for road transport, nor in accordance with the tremendous cumulative need for road transport by reform and maintenance, especially by the huge increase in the number of tourists to the country and by the rate of increasing traffic weights. The Parliament has not been given the opportunity to discuss and provide a legal guide for the priorities of transport money and, in fact, it seems, that the budget assumes an even less effective strategy than it has been seen in the proposal of an internal secretary of transportation program that was not to be paid the last time when it was submitted to the Council, May 27 of May. The rapid decline in economic investments is predicted by a reduction in gross investments between 2018 and 2019. Few suggestions, policies, or visions can be found in the budget on any type of investment that might be in the water other than major projects. Only one sentence on page. 20 Notes that large investment projects are being carried on in tourism, especially hotel buildings. No other public investments are being proclaimed on the part of the current government, nor is it possible for any of the expanding forces in society to be created successfully because of this imbalance. It is only said that governments and rural communities will be on the alert and will be concerned about counterwarrants. The same is true when it comes to commercial investment. There will also be a dangerous development in the coming years, but as reflected in national forecasts, employment investment will decrease from less than 21% as a proportion of GDP to less than 1.5% in 2017, as shown in the figure provided. In fact, according to the prophecy, it will be negative in 2018. There is no mention of government policy when it comes to investments. Therefore, it is urgent that the secretary of finance clarifyes his policy when it comes to investments, both employment investments and public investments, but especially when it is now understood that capitalism will be completely released in the near future and that investment levels will be increased. Iceland\'s Habitat estimates that unemployment will be 2.9% next year compared to 3%, as expected in the budget. In view of this, about 350 million people are put in place. K. a decrease in the cost of unemployment. Granted, unemployment has declined since a happy financial breakdown, but there must be a serious concern for the authorities as to how much and how rising unemployment is among the academics in the country. The proportion of academics of total unemployed has increased from 18% to 25% since 2013. That may be one reason our people go abroad. In spite of this serious situation, it is stated in the financial bill that the government prepares for changes in the tax law to pay the advice of foreign experts on temporary special projects, as shown by the Ministry of Education, which is probably a well paid rate, but there are no special measures in the government budget or financial policies to increase the professional benefits of university education in this country. The prime minister for the final implementation of housing and the future of the camp loan and many matters relating to its activities was not available at the contributions of a bill to finance but part of it is being made during the last days of the council. It is difficult to plan for the council to discuss the effect of housing on dogs\'budget during the last days before Christmas. At this point, it is only possible that the changes that are being done will lead to the failure of the camp loan fund in the same form, but it is unclear how much change affects its ability to drive. When the bill was prepared, it was refused to cancel a warrant, since rent loans to a tenant partner are not expected according to the specific arrangements. Instead, the Government\'s declaration on housing issues dated May 28th. proclaimed the basis for a new social rental system designed to be funded by the founding of state and rural society and the government\'s direct wax payment, but at the contributions of the budgetary bill, this foundation had not yet been laid. All too many people live in dissatisfaction over housing, and they are unable to handle high housing costs and now, when the ideal period is more than halfway around the world, it is shocking to see the inexplicable characteristics of the government when it comes to housing, and there is nothing that has been done to face real problems, not landlords or landowners, despite the wonderful promises. A respectable president. I\'m going to go to the health - care centers that get a lot of space during the discussion. According to the National Hospital, in a memo sent to a budget committee, the cost of contracts is 400 million. K. beyond payback, this will take into account the reorganization of the physician\'s work programme, which will apply to January 1. and reduces the cost by 175 million. Part of the profit of the state\'s funds is the drive of the Land Hospital into the sanctuary. In spite of a significant problem that will not be solved by the adjustment of the share in this budget, the top priority for the health system is expressed. Hence, the management post suggests that there has been a considerable lack of hospital funding in harmony with the hospital\'s work. This is because the current year\'s strikes reduced the cost of a short time that will likely hit the hospital full weight next year. This has not been adequately maintained, as we know, and it has been seen that the hospital maintenance funding are relatively small compared with other comparable North countries, which makes the need for maintenance accumulates with related problems. The government has taken its foot off during the renewal of a Land Hospital of ▪ University Hospital, and it seems that it is a long delay for the people of the country to have a service as best they can do in other places, despite the efforts of the Agency\'s employees. In particular, ministers have been able to express themselves in a very different way as to the location of the hospital, making it sufficient for them to include prime minister and health minister. The left movement has offered full suggestions on how to finance the building and the necessary purchases. Adding a wealth tax to the country\'s most treaties can result in an end to the funding of these necessary projects within a designated period of time. The left movement, therefore, encourages the tax to be laid on and the building is rising rapidly in the years ahead for the benefit of all the people of the country. But there are more hospitals than the Landspit. The situation in the Business Hospital in Akureyri isn\'t good enough because of this government policy. To keep the hospital operating in Akureyri, 110 million will be required. K. contributes to the business in addition to what is expected in the budget. Otherwise, organizational adjustments are needed, with more than 70 million. K. This is the first nine months of this year. A team on the construction of the labor departments at the Akureyri Hospital, which returned the medical minister a report on autumn days sees the only practical advantage of new ones to solve the problems facing its housing problems. Health Ministers are advised to provide a future policy and a management plan for the hospital at the head of the Northern country. Medical institutions are also practical. At least two of them will make ends meet. It seems that their unity has not been properly prepared. A lower portion of the protest is contributing to the well - being of these important cornerstones in the region, and it is important that the country enjoys all the more intensive health care wherever they live. This brings us to social security, which has also given us considerable space during the discussion. The bill expects a 9.6% rise in pension insurance from next year on, but correction according to the lowest wage is not included. I think it is reasonable that this group is reasonable and insists on correcting the interests of older citizens and desperate ones, since this group cannot go into a strike to improve their terms. According to a recent opinion of the Quantum Community, monthly provisions were made for microenergy donors who live alone and who receive a suitable household supplementation of about 187,507 p.m. in months more than 172 thousand in those who lived with another 18 - year - old or older, these numbers are based on the past year. In the same opinion, it is counted as adeduction requirement, but according to the opinion of the team, a childless individual needs to live in his own house, 348 you. K. per month, more than 482 thousand per tax, in order to meet normal expenses. These figures in whites show that micromasks do not stand a chance to live a decent life off their income, and that in itself applies to older citizens as well. In view of the earnings of senior citizens, the response of the social minister to the U.S. P.A.\'s request by Indriðadóttir Injunradóttir showed that 70% of the senior citizens had earned less than 300 levels. K. if we have combined income including government insurance payments. All should be able to unite in caring for these groups with greater respect than is now being done. It is necessary to improve mental - health options. A resolution proposal for mental health care and policies for four years submitted in November is a step forward. According to the proposal, about 112 million people next year are expected to take three measures. Two of these are found in financial laws, but one is missing, an operation that has been named A.9. By permission of the president here says: ▪ You must meet the growing need for mental - health professionals for housing and service. The government situation suggests that it will be corrected and proposed in its missing 33.1 million. If these funds are available, they will pay for the mental - health care of people who are now staying in the Land Hospital because of lack of agricultural services, and for the purpose of services that will result in a state of mental - health care, not having to stay in a hospital because of the lack of opportunities for the future. Sexual violence statistics are striking and show that a large proportion of women in Iceland have been subjected to such violence, and a large proportion of young girls are subject to child abuse. The government market suggests 200 million. K. protect against sexual violence, rely on the rights of the justice system, and ensures effective measures for sexual abuse victims. It is very important to strengthen both the police and the prosecutions and to ensure that all professions are properly educated, all those who render broken service, such as social service and community service, which are involved in legal proceedings for them. While diversity and flexibility have been among the main costs of our high school, the present government is gradually changing the educational system through budget without a widespread professional discussion in the community and in the council. They are working undergroundly to weaken the small schools in the country, thus reducing the opportunities for a wide range of home Bible studies in their locality. The same policy has also been forced through the larger urban settlements. It points to more expensive routes of private schools, or chronic education centers, for those over 25 years of age who want to study books that even lead to migration. Increased donations with each student at the highest. As a result, a minister of education speaks a lot about the access limits and the poor business of smaller schools not being able to enter the number of students. Study access is very important to small communities; it not only increases education levels but also increases the likelihood that people will decide to continue living in the scattered areas. I\'ll give you 15 million. K. adjustments in proposals to meet the growth of distant students in small high school schools as well as 5 billion. K. to spread to weapons, a fine addition to high school activities, as well as a far less expensive risk to families in scattered areas. In addition to this, the government wants to contribute more money so that 25 years of age and older can be delivered from high school accounting. According to a new OECD report, donations at each university student in Iceland are very low and far from what is commonly used in neighboring countries. Nevertheless, a powerful university education is the most important way to ensure future prosperity, a work structure based on initiatives and innovations of individuals, but it is not about medium-controlled solutions and building up here the knowledge community that all political parties claim to pursue in word. The General Assembly\'s agreement for a century of Iceland\'s University, which is added here to some of the funds has not been followed, but this fund has been the University of Iceland\'s University of Rockies following in recession in times of crisis. Its establishment was adopted at the General Assembly for the 100th anniversary of Iceland\'s University and has been mainly used to promote innovation and research. The plan was for government and school to set up a budget for financing in 2016-2020. Among other things, the goal was to make contributions for each student so that Iceland would have an average OECD and later an average neighboring country. But nothing has been asked, prime minister has not seen fit to comment on the case, nor is there evidence in the bill to keep up the fund as planned. There are changes on the part of the government that repairs some of the colleges in the country, but unfortunately, the aimlessness and clearness of the future are lacking. For example, the University of Bifröst gets 50 million people to secure a homeless business while the University of Akureyri has been holding for many years in a budget of heavy maintenance operations and has actually been paid to pay for it. The agricultural schools have been hit when it comes to financing, and the present education minister\'s mind seems to be moving toward united University of Bifrost and thus become privateised. However, more than a portion of the legal committee suggests that Iceland\'s National College of Agriculture at The Netherlands will receive 58 million. K. temporary contributions, which is an earmarked agreement with the employment and innovation services for agricultural research. High school gets 25 million. K. temporary contributions to meet the collection of management halls. It\'s a good one, but it\'s very important that long - term policy is in order so that schools don\'t have to have enough money to make budgets for each year. I call attention to a small team here that may not be a small team. It is known as the School of Health for Schools. The bill for financing is shown in this section on page 5. 283 on the budget bill, by permission of the President: 50 million is low. K. if you are transferred to 872 Icelandic loan fund to meet an increase in the cost of your services... Now it is true that the main income supply of a majority of the budgetary committees is to reduce funds to the loan fund by reducing the number of loaners. This is interesting, since assistance to students in the country is being reduced by taking off the so - called rural strength, and how can the cost of management be increased if such applications fall in LIN? That sounds odd. Mr. President. Over the past few years, there have been reports on the need to support Icelandic in a digital world and to make it possible in our dealings with computers and computer - controlled devices. On May 12, 2014, at the 143th legislature Parliamentary Recontraction on the Use of Icelandic information technology was adopted by a digital legislation programme. A committee was set up to produce a program for making Icelandic currency in digital information technology and contribute to its use in that field. A report entitled The Icelandic language of a digital age is the product of a major European project, META-NET, which lasted over 2011-2013 and covered 30 European languages. There they examined the language language language language for 30 and electronic support. The conclusion of this survey was that in the United States, 30 languages are now being handled in the second degree. In the spring of 2015, the Language Fund was set up as a contribution to this project, but now it receives only 30 million, a third of what the committee proposed. If we were to spend 200 million years for the next five years so that we did not miss the fast technology. It needs to be treated quickly and amazed that this case is not getting more attention in the budget where the secretary of finance himself made it a special topic at the October Independence Party meeting, as well as to which the Ministry of Education and Culture declared it very clearly on the day of the Icelandic language to be a good support to the project. That\'s the stuff. It seems that the administrative part is having difficulty allowing the State Radio to carry out its role in peace. A RUSH board met with a panel of funding committees and realized that the plans to lower the radio fee on a second time would translate counterless changes in the activities of the one nation\'s One Lightmaker in the country owned by the public and work in the public sector as well as in contracting all the projects. The reduction will reduce the activity of RUS to such an extent that the legal function of the Agency will not change any of the 60 million that come into the budget because of the increased numbers of citizens. In my opinion, the stage is bad for the communication and creation of civilization in the country, careful and independent reporting, and critical of political and social issues. It is important to provide as much of the language as possible. The bill does not expect to meet the local financial demand for translocation of disabled persons. The report for 2013-2014 shows that the situation is negative to 1.2 billion. Even today, rural communities feel compelled to return the issue to the State, which makes it more likely that services will get worse and thus increase the standard of living for individuals. It is certainly an agreement that we hope to make between the state and the community, but no income is expected there, either in equal funds or anywhere else, to meet it. The government has disregarded the law to establish laws about the NAPA, services to disabled people. It is in accordance with the opinion of the local government that cooperation with the government in this area is not the way it should be, and I encourage the government to bring a fair suit of paint. Sadly, the government has failed to live carefree nights of the elderly. This was shown in a very thorough answer to my inquiry to the health - care minister. The number of elderly ones will increase rapidly over the years, so it is important that society is ready to accept the resulting changes. As the situation is now, the government gives wealth and encourages a second smaller section of the government to provide practical, well - funded future solutions for this important issue. The government lacks complete vision of transport, and there is no transport plan. The transport board supervises the process of transport, but the Council is now implementing a policy-making program for the 2015-226 season as well as a work programme for its first four-year period under law. Clearly, it is not up to us to blame ourselves for the fact that the plan will not end by itself enough to make the plan as we all know it. The reason for the failure of the plan is, as previously said, a lack of policy development and the future vision of the government. Its suggestions contain 100 million. K. the increase in funding to strengthen the country\'s road system beyond the sum of the budget bill, which is sufficient for the upcoming projects. That leads to 200 billion. K. The expansion of the road construction programme, but the projects that are listed there, at least, remind me not of the priority list of the Road model. It would be interesting to know how they were selected. Good transport is an important part of national security, important urbanity, and the need to secure community infrastructure. Some parts of the country are faced with such a serious financial shortage that they cannot properly drive public transportation. Clearly, the problems of all of them will not be solved by the contribution made by the greater proportion of the legal committee. Part 2 is important to the government to present a public transport bill as soon as possible to solve this problem. The failure of the government in financing of tourism has been in line with the lack of policy and its future vision in the media. The fund is funded but not in financial terms, but, as we know, financial support is to be a correctional law and financed by unexpected activities, while financial contributions are put forth and financed by the government\'s policies. The government has turned it around, against the aims of a budget. Unregistered budgets and agricultural rescue efforts have been used in budgets as well as in detriment of all plans. Funds for 2015 expected 146 million. K. To the project fund. On budgets for the same year dolls up to 850 million. K. Added to the project fund, then 22 more. A similar plan was set up for the last budget bill as well. The 2016 budget bill expects 149 million, so it was started again in a comparable way, but that amount was raised to 749 million. K. for this discussion. Then, more and less upset by the late production of financing, which has not been taken into account by local planning needs and the expense share of rural and landowners, is way too high for them to enjoy, some of them, not earning their investments and possessions. The latest part of this category is still one committee, the tourist control centre, which takes over some 80 billion. K. without evidence that the existing options could not be further advanced. As the government took over the administrations, the financial contributions made to the international parishion and thus showed its view of a former government policy to restore the decision - making world to the province. 400 billion were used to provide funds for the international parish projects. K. in 2013, but the first act of the government was to cut them down quickly to 15 million on a budget bill for 2014. After much resistance to the government and to local authorities, the contributions were raised to 100 billion. K. and on budget bill 2015, we returned to 15 billion. K. A donation was raised between discussions to 100 million. The bill, as previously indicated, contributes to 145 million, which, in the opinion of my share, is seen in the nostrils of a cat for eight parts of the country. The 2nd. 35 million were put in place. K. In cultural agreements with rural areas, but financial contributions to national cultural work have greatly been made, as the minority has been tireless to point out. Instead of getting the money and working according to the parish plan, more of the legal committees are pulling out specific projects and putting in additional financial items. In fact, the majority contributes to what is supposed to be part of the parish program, just a schedule, but it doesn\'t put it in the big pot and divide it out. There are special committees with representatives of the administration parties who offer suggestions on a number of projects that would undoubtedly be excellent, rather than using the democratic methods that would identify the parish plans. They are also characterized by democratic practices. The lack of professionalism and the lack of vision is reflected in this round of budgets and a view of the fragmented areas of the country in this cut - down or poor budget. The left movement ◯ The green supply encourages the government to give up these plans, to take over, and to build up for the future in the scattered, open, and democratic areas. Finally, Mr. President, I\'d like to say that I\'ve mainly killed on many of the faults and shortcomings of the budgetary bill, as the lesser part of which often does. I\'ve done a big thing, but the bill isn\'t meant to build up and strengthen the interiors of society, as I thought it would be. The government continues on the same path toward flat tax policy despite the fact that such factors are an obstacle. This may best be seen by the obsession of the present government that the once-a-half-fold tax system, regardless of its consequences for the different income groups in the country, reduces the fishing costs of large - scale fishing in one of the most profitable fishing roads, and does not extend a modest wealth tax on all the richest individuals in the country. The pay-off section of the budget shows this in the starving policy for the health and education institutions of the country, the pensioners and the public institutions needed in the country. Clearly, this policy is not determined by the need for public economic management but by a conscious, ideological action designed to undermine the community of equations and cohesion that has characterized the Norwegian nations in recent decades. As we have considered, the next year\'s policy is secret and clear to create a society in which the consumption is so low that the welfare community is in danger. Such fundamental changes in Icelandic society should not be forth silent and silent. They will be discussed, both from the left green and from the public in the country.']","<|system|>

Honourable Members of the Riigikogu! Very honorable ambassadors and the entire diplomatic corps! Nine years will always mark the round anniversary of events of the past century in Europe. These include the anniversary of the fateful Molotov-Ribbentrop criminal conspiracy and the subsequent loss of freedom and the war on the weather. But it also marks the end of the era of undemocratic governance in Europe, as the 19th Versailles Peace Treaty ended its first war, and in 1989 a second world war ended in Eastern Europe when, one after another, totalitarian regimes fell as dominoes. The Baltic Way took place in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the former Czechoslovakia took place at the same time as the first free elections took place in Poland under the leadership of solidarity. The Berlin Wall, which, together with the reunification of Germany, laid the foundation for the reunification of Europe, also fell to the top, under pressure from these forces. However, the work of bringing Europe together has not yet been completed three decades later. I reminded the President of Ukraine who recently visited Tallinn that in July 2017 I expressed my hope in the opening speech of our Presidency to the European Parliament to see the President of Ukraine in the same role one day in front of this Chamber. This dream is still alive. Next year, there will be summits both in the Western Balkans and in the Eastern Partnership, which will certainly be the footsteps of a new geopolitical Europe for these European countries. Can Europe cope with itself? The year 2019 should not be a year in history when a new meteor shower began to sink in the window of Europe. If you use the words of Ivan Krastev, Europe should not become a jealously defending monastery or a mirage from a monastery. History has not run out in Europe. Those countries and nations that are working towards democratic ideals, human rights and social reforms must have the opportunity to be part of a European family sharing common values. Northern Macedonia and Albania deserve a new opportunity. Very Honourable Riigikogu! Europe is a completely unique continent because it is built on freedom, human rights and solidarity and is democratically governed. The European Union has been an obvious political guarantee of this, but if we think about security, there is no alternative to NATO. A week ago, I attended a summit dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the Alliance and I am pleased to announce that the Union is in very good health. The Alliance\'s mission continues to be the protection of its allies, and the Alliance has the necessary plans and capabilities to do so. Also, President Trump has not remained the voice of the shouter in the desert: Europe\'s allies and Canada have increased defence spending for five years in a row, and 130 billion more has come by 2020. In 2% of the club, if you can say so, there are already nine members this year. There is no need to grasp the air for an alternative and to panic. Protecting Europe is happening together with our allies. The solution is cooperation, not building walls. I therefore regret that a good attempt by the Finnish Presidency to find a solution to the involvement of allies in the permanent structured defence cooperation of the European Union has not yet been supported by everyone. However, if you think about what can and can still be done in the area of security at European Union level, this could be a broad-based approach to security that is characteristic of Estonia and has a clear-cut meaning. A broad-based approach to security will enable the European Union to contribute increasingly to the protection and security of Europe and the Member States. For us, it is important that the solidarity clause in the Treaty on European Union should have a common understanding, especially in the resolution of crisis situations. It is important for us that critical and important cross-border services have performance rules and security of supply, that technology risk assessment, hybrid risk control and cyber risks are jointly addressed, and that investments are made that strengthen security. Very Honourable Riigikogu! I have also been told repeatedly in this Chamber that Estonia opposed the goal of climate neutrality. I can assure you that in June we were not ready to make this target binding. At that point, it was not known whether we were technologically or economically capable of living here in the 59th latitude distributed settlement. However, today we know both that we are capable of doing so and that we know what needs to be done. I would like to thank the good people of the Tallinn office of the Stockholm Environmental Institute for this, who did not know at all how important and time-critical this analysis would be when they started studying these options and options. I am pleased that this study of facts confirmed the conviction that climate neutrality in Estonia has already arisen in me. Thanks to this analysis, together with our Baltic colleagues, we were able to send a joint return to our colleagues, the message being that it is not right to reduce the overall size of the European Union\'s long-term budget due to the volume of climate investment and to reduce the resources that will enable the Baltic States to achieve these goals. The EU impact assessment of the next steps will be completed by the same time of next year. And I am very pleased that this will be done, because weighty decisions should be based on the best possible knowledge. Then there will be concrete proposals, which must be realistic and feasible, so that we actually reach climate neutrality in Europe. This shows that it is not just the right things to do, but the right things to do. I thank the good Estonian scientists and especially the President of the Academy of Sciences, Tarmo Soomere, for his active engagement in organising a climate conference in cooperation with the State Chancellery. I am glad that Estonia has not only problems or obligations, but Estonian science also has knowledge and new generation solutions. The challenge of turning green could infect Estonian technolootics with the best education in Europe as much as digital technology has done so far. You have brought the right problem to our science, so help us to create as many solutions as possible, because tomorrow\'s world is yours. Honourable Riigikogu! The forthcoming Climate and Energy Plan (REC 2030) has taken the right course, leaving Member States with the opportunity to make their own choices. However, I would stress that, unlike many, Estonia is on the track to meet its 2020 targets and, as a result of developments, it will probably fill them with a reserve. We have also already set one of the highest emission reduction targets in the European Union by 2030 compared to 1990, i.e. 70%, and, for example, in the case of renewable energy, we are among the five more ambitious countries, taking into account our opportunities as well. I am convinced that the transition to climate neutrality should be technologically neutral and also as market-based as possible, because only in this way is it likely that opportunities, choices and, of course, freedoms will increase. As long as we do not have a magic wand in the form of suitable energy sources, we should not start throwing aside, one by one, the possibility of guaranteeing energy security for countries with an appropriate choice of clean technologies. We also need to continue to strengthen our energy security and security of supply with the help of external organisations. This week, the Balticconnector gas connection for Finland will be opened in Paldiski Estonia, which will make the single market for three countries operational. Last week, the construction of the Lithuanian-era electricity line connection started, which is a very important project to synchronise the Baltic electricity systems with Europe. We hope to join the central European synchronous area in the middle of the decade, and we will try to get over the tail of the dog in the spring of next year and finance the project to the end. However, due to the objective of climate neutrality, there may be a need to further strengthen internal and external connections, especially if energy sources are to be located on the west coast of Estonia in the future. Discussions on climate neutrality, energy revolution and security of supply will certainly take a very large part of the discussions in the honourable Riigikogu in the coming years. Then we can say more clearly what is what every Estonian person can do best for the well-being of the planet and what he can expect of the country. It is probably not an area that would not be affected by this purpose. However, the objective is clear: to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, or 2050, our carbon emissions must be equal to carbon sequestration. We must also see in this objective our great opportunity, the possibility of saving natural resources, the possibility of creating new jobs and new technologies, as well as the possibility of reducing dependence on certain energy sources and their suppliers. By creating clean alternatives, we naturally want to use existing comforts and not lose opportunities to discover the world. While we used to think about Rail Baltic as primarily a strategic connection to the European centre, we are now conscious of rail as an environmentally friendly alternative to the current more polluting modes of transport. The Community will make an important contribution to meeting the climate objectives by significantly reducing road traffic loads and associated pollution caused by international freight transport. I assure you that Rail Baltic continues to be an important strategic objective for the government, and we will do our utmost to remain in the plan and secure the European funds for Rail Baltic. I dedicated more than half of my last week\'s meeting with my Baltic colleagues in Riga. The representatives of Poland, Finland, the European Commission and the Joint Undertaking also participated, and all expressed their commitment. I also met with the interim chairman of the joint venture to improve communication and speed up the construction of Estonian objects. I believe that we have also found a way to unravel the unknot created around the joint venture, which we will discuss again in Tallinn at the beginning of February. At the end of this part, however, I also want to say that I and Estonia as a whole continue to be grateful to Ida-Viru County and to people working and working in the oil shale industry in Ida-Viru County. We are here today, where we are economically, thanks very much to the contribution of these people and their families. We\'re not gonna forget that when we\'re doing the hero, either. Similarly, Europe will not forget this and will contribute to creating new opportunities, new investments and new prospects. The government has worked to ensure that oil shale and Ida-Virumaa have a solid place in the new European Commission fund for a fair transition from fossil fuels to clean fuels. Members of the Riigikogu! What would be the European Union\'s policy without a digital internal market? You would probably ask if the internal market was complete. Progress in this direction does not mean that we can rest on our laurels, because the benefits of the digital market, as goods and services, are not the story of ourselves. Europe\'s technological capacity and a smooth digital transition in society will, above all, ensure a much greater contribution to the development of the next generation of technological capabilities. We need to do this together in order to compete globally. During the last year, we saw the 5G example, which may mean a delay in the pace of development, in the assessment of security risks, or in the price, compared to what may not have developed in the light of market rules. We need to ensure that the internal market continues to develop and functions smoothly and with a wider range of choices. We must have the courage to create opportunities for an innovation-enhancing data economy in key sectors. Europe must also find a solution to the issues of the data economy in external trade relations and create legal clarity for the development of artificial intelligence. Future regulation must be precisely that it accelerates technological progress through smart regulation, making data safely available, creating legal clarity for consumers and legal certainty for businesses. The draft Estonian Crati Act will also come to this hall next year. I believe that we do not want to live by the default provisions written in the business development departments of remote large companies and to exchange personal data into services on the basis of them uncontrollable. Remember the saying that if the online service is free, you will be sold yourself. In terms of legal certainty and technological progress, clarity is also needed on liability. At the same time, we do not want a regulatory environment that has gone far enough and does not leave sufficient room for technology, creativity or developers. I hope that, by the end of the new European Commission\'s term of office, we will have a clear understanding of the European Data Space and the opportunities for the real-time economy across borders. Honourable members of the Riigikogu! I also owe you, standing before you, an explanation as to why this time the Government\'s European Union priority document is shorter, more specific and also thinner. The reason lies in the strategic planning reform carried out by the State Chancellery, which will result in the ""Estonia 2035"" roof strategy being completed next year. The strategy will build on sectoral development plans and national budget programmes in the future. Sectoral EU policies will also be an organic part of a comprehensive process of national strategic planning and development plans in the future. It will then be better linked to the country\'s larger goals and also to the means, as the design and cooperation of European policy are part of Estonia\'s everyday life. The plenary of the Riigikogu and also the Riigikogu committees are actively involved in this work. The day-to-day work on preparing positions on European Union matters will, of course, start to build on these documents so that Estonia\'s interests are even better protected. The two-year cycle of the European Union\'s policy priorities document will allow for more flexible planning of the objectives that will be included in the country\'s strategies and sectoral development plans. It also allows for a faster and more flexible response to change. It is also important for us that the renewed European Semester process and the long-term European budget support the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the \'Estonia 2035\' objectives. The government is under the leadership of the State Chancellery updating and organizing the strategic planning of the entire government. During the strategic planning reform there is also close coordination with the Riigikogu, including the Riigikogu\'s important role in this process. I hope that this will lead to more meaningful and lively discussions with ministers here, in front of the full Chamber of Honorable Riigikogu, including sectoral European Union policies. I would like to thank the Committee on European Union Affairs for its cooperation and always for its very in-depth discussions, and thank its chairman, its members and the entire secretariat. Honourable Riigikogu! In the interests of Estonia, the European Union is influential and united in the world and is value-based, solidarity-based and functioning internally effectively. Regrettably, not all the signs in the world are encouraging. According to Freedom House, the freedom rate in the world has been falling for 13 years in a row. Next year we will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the first Estonian Constitution and not only in order to remember the beginning of statehood, the rule of law and the hard-won freedom, but also European fundamental rights and freedoms in Estonia. The wave of freedom in Eastern Europe three decades ago broke out of desire and desire to enjoy the human rights and democratic freedoms of the free world. From a distance, Europe still looks like an oasis of freedoms. The most modern human rights treaty in the world, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, has just become ten years old with the Lisbon Treaty. Its first sentence states: \'The peoples of Europe, by creating an ever closer union, are determined to share a peaceful future based on common values. \' The first article of the Charter of Fundamental Rights provides for the integrity, respect and protection of human dignity, because without it there is no peace, there are no freedoms, there is no Europe, as we know it. Our geopolitical, ecological and technological challenges today are also a question of human freedom, opportunities and rights. Working together in Europe, we will solve these challenges in a way that creates opportunities to increase freedoms and respects human dignity. Others want these standards, and they are also needed by companies. In his speech, the new President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, quoted Václav Havel\'s sentence that he would take up work \'to do good and not because something could be done\'. The future European conference must give citizens the opportunity to address key issues and offer them decent solutions, because no one else in the world will do this for us. Human dignity-based solutions are also good solutions. This dialogue with citizens should certainly not become a \'Ptydepe\', a bureaucratic new language, a double or a kafka process, as described by Václav Havel. Europe is not an elite project, it is a political project for the people of Europe. I am therefore particularly pleased that, at the end of 2019, support for the European Union among both Estonian and Russian-speaking people is very high: 81% and 79% respectively. Europe must celebrate hope for the future, be a solution and encourage the next generations. Just as when we hear the word \'Estonia\', the word \'Europe\' must speak to our souls. And I think that the Riigikogu, as a representative of the people, should be involved as closely as possible in this work in the future. I wish Charles Michel, Ursula von der Leyen and the European Commission all the strength to cooperate. I sincerely thank President Tusk and President Juncker, who led Europe, the European Council and the European Commission at a critical time. Of course, I would like to thank my closest colleagues from the State Chancellery and the ELS from this Riigikogu speech chair. Thank you for your cooperation, for your support. Thank you for your attention.', 'Hi! My apologies for the technical hiccups! Dear Riigikogu! Honourable ambassadors! In August, we celebrate together the 30th anniversary of the restoration of Estonia\'s national self-being, one of the pillars of which is the effort to be a worthy member of the cultural people\'s family. This step gave us, among other things, the opportunity to be part of a common European goal of peace, security and prosperity. It is a fact that without our country, we would not have such an opportunity and choice to make Estonia bigger and not to be and remain alone. It is also true that statehood alone does not guarantee such an opportunity, nor does it guarantee an invitation to a place at a table, this place was fought out with sweat and tears in the first decade of restoration of independence, as was the case with statehood. Our trust and reputation, which is our strongest currency, is won over the years, lost in seconds and restored to eternity. Professor Martin Ehala rightly points out that solidarity is not possible without the sharing of core values. I quote: ""Trust, coherence and solidarity depend on the members\' belief that other people around them share the same values. ""If Estonia is not understood, is not reliable, is not predictable, it is no longer part of us, or part of the West, and is no longer protected by core values at all. Sovereignty does not exist in vacuum, but in relation to its own and others, and above all, it means responsibility for the future of both Estonia and Europe. I would therefore like to use the words of the fresh Head of the European Union Affairs Committee of the Riigikogu that it is appropriate for us to talk about united sovereignty. It is our sovereignty that is linked to the sovereignty of our friends and allies, not to those who are hostile to our own world. It is a united sovereignty that brings us the common defence of the Allied Forces, the euro security net of the single currency, access to the world\'s best knowledge, the market for our services and goods, and support for the construction of state secondary schools, e-state and hospitals. It also brings Estonia a rapid, effective and necessary dose of the corona vaccine. Together, the combined forces of sovereignty will help us cope with the great technological, demographic and ecological changes of the 21st century, which will inevitably confuse the geopolitical map. Europe has created a unique opportunity for us to be an influential decision-maker, not a mouthful on the menu, a building block in the sphere of influence, or a forgotten hybrid frozen conflict. It has therefore been in Estonia\'s best interests, and it should always be to aspire to the core of European policy and joint decisions, because it is the strongest guarantee for a small country to determine its own destiny and future. Honourable Riigikogu! We could hardly have thought some time ago that the health issue would be at the heart of all discussions, including those on European Union policy. This year we experienced the moment when the internal market was interrupted, and we also experienced the moment when the world was breathing. Public health is basically a national competence based on the European Union\'s Treaties, i.e. ""everyone for himself."" The question for critics is therefore a little legitimate: why did you think that the first reaction to an unknown disease would be anything other than chaotic and self-centered? As a lesson in the crisis, I support the European Union\'s ability to declare a health emergency and act quickly, if necessary. Similarly, when reviewing the Schengen rules, the lessons of the health crisis must be taken into account and made more crisis-proof, so as not to experience again the selfishness that arose just last spring. All the fundamental freedoms of the European Union were suddenly affected by the borders in brackets, and the desire for personal protective equipment or breathing equipment showed that the laws of the jungle were in force. Perhaps we were a little disappointed because we take the European Union as a self-evident part of our lives. We simply believe in Europe and expect much from it, even if we have jealously defended our own existence. Only in May, at the initiative of the European Commission, EUR 7.5 billion were collected for diagnostic, therapeutic and vaccine development. If we rise to the crisis once again, perhaps we dare say that there is a small miracle that the corona virus vaccines exist because of the mobilisation of resources, and that we have a truly solidarity system, both to divide them between Member States and to allocate them to the rest of the world. A year ago, it was said here that Estonia is too small a country for pharmaceutical companies and that new medicines will be here too late or too expensive, but this should not be the case in the single European market. It is clear that without the European Union, we would not have corona vaccines today, and the comprehensive development of such a system must also be continued after the crisis. Honourable Riigikogu! Another important support has been financial solidarity. Among other things, the European Union Re-launch Facility also provided an opportunity to propose further investments in strengthening the health system and the hospital network. I am pleased that the opposition has already expressed its support for this plan, too, and we have broad-based support. I would also like to welcome the fact that we have done a good job at international level with the vaccine certificate at the World Health Organisation, and I have reason to hope that this will also be taken into account to a very large extent in tomorrow\'s European Commission proposal on vaccination certificates. An important observation of experience lies in the previous major financial crisis, which we are standing on our shoulders today. As a result of the latest crisis experience, we have strengthened the euro area and the corona crisis has made what has been done an indispensable safety net, so the insurance policy is working. To illustrate this, I will highlight just a few remarkable measures. The European Commission has authorised State aid to alleviate the crisis in COVID-19 to the tune of around EUR 3 trillion. However, the European Central Bank\'s extraordinary asset purchase programme to contain the economic effects of a pandemic is worth EUR 1850 billion, or nearly EUR 2 trillion. This, in turn, will be complemented by a budget for the European Union of around EUR 1.1 trillion and a re-launch plan of EUR 750 billion. This, in turn, is complemented by many other measures, a safety net already in place, such as the European Stability Mechanism, and the TERA supporting unemployment insurance systems. This can be described as no more or less than truly extraordinary and historic solidarity, but also as a remarkable investment in future security, because in the next crisis we are already relying on what we are building from today\'s experience. Dear Riigikogu! Thirdly, the major internal market of the European Union is also an important source of crisis security. It is true that shortcomings have also occurred here, and this fear has not really disappeared even now that new strains of the virus are spreading. The crisis even brought to light, even unexpectedly, the fact that information technology allows society to function tolerablely even under quite extreme conditions. I cannot imagine this cross-border coordination without today\'s communication, and it is a testimony that we are also doing our democratic duty here via the Internet. It is clear from the hedgehog that access to strategically important materials and technology is not only important for the protection of health, but also for the implementation of the green and digital revolutions. With this awareness, we wrote a joint letter with four prime ministers for women in the European Union asking for a decade to be focused on the development of basic European capabilities and to create a framework, legislation and toolbox to monitor their achievement. Last week, the European Commission presented the Digital compass initiative, which, alongside chips, quantum computers, digital skills and other things, finally targets us with such a lovely widespread introduction of digital signatures. I hope that the Council will give it fundamental approval next week. Of course, we would like the European Union to continue with the issue of the free movement of data and to help to find value in all areas and industrial sectors. It is also important that the forthcoming Digital Services Act offers European companies and platforms the opportunity to enjoy a genuinely large internal market. I am also pleased that the European Union is looking for a shared role with NATO in the development of critical technologies, as well as with the United States in relation to the subject of regulation and taxation of platforms. I believe that the West, together, has every reason to look at some trends in digital technology in the world with concern and to act together. Honourable Riigikogu! We have not inherited the land from our parents, but we have borrowed it from our children. Fred Jüssi, Rein Marani or David Attenborough"" nature films and the recent stories of Levila with former forest rangers help to remember the changed environment. We are not only talking about the consequences for nature as a quiet crisis and abstract loss of biodiversity, forests and soil fertility. Man-made climate change is a source of many new conflicts. The reason for the spread of germ viruses is the consistent and massive change in the boundaries of nature by man to the benefit of man and so that nature loses its inner capacity to cope with it. We all know the saying, ""The manor\'s rope, let it slide."" It turns out that free and unlimited use of nature does not exist, and over-exploitation results in naturelessness and poverty, and then hopelessness and poverty. A report by Partha Dashupta, an economist at the University of Cambridge, commissioned by the UK Government, was just published. The report recalls the disastrous trend in the loss of mechanisms for over-exploitation and self-repair of nature. For example, between 1992 and 2014, physical capital, i.e. roads, machinery, buildings, factories, ports, etc., has doubled per capita, while natural capital reserves per capita decreased by almost 40%. In other words, mankind\'s prosperity has been devastating to nature. The report therefore calls for the inclusion of natural capital in the accounts alongside physical capital. Carbon pricing on a sector-by-sector basis has certainly been an important step in the right direction. In Estonia, too, emissions have decreased mainly in the sectors of the emission trading system and in other sectors. Since this is a global effort, it is important to stress that it is not enough to set a very distant end goal, but also what happens now and in the next decade. I therefore support that we have both an incentive and a deterrent system to achieve this objective. The European Union and the United States must put their backs together to bring third countries behind this ambition. I also reiterate the view that the government supports the European Union\'s objective of climate neutrality and its inclusion as a legally binding objective in the so-called European climate law. Moreover, we also support this objective for Estonia and we have just initiated the development plan for the environmental field. In the next two months, we are looking forward to an impact assessment by both the European Commission and Estonia on how 55% of emissions reductions can be achieved. In the context of the European Union\'s decisions, it is important that the achievement of this objective must be cost-effective and fair. Sensitive industrial sectors must have the opportunity and time to adapt to change, resulting in a gradual move towards climate neutrality. I personally very much welcome the creation of a fair transition fund for the regions most affected. I have already fought for this as a Member of the European Parliament, and I think it is very right that the government decided to direct all this money to Ida-Viru County. Honourable Riigikogu! The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has stated that achieving climate neutrality is a new growth strategy for Europe. During the launch of the 1996 Tiger Jump program, President Lennart Meri used the saying ""who is late will miss it."" With such a healthy attitude, we should also approach the green turn, which according to the endangered species of the Baltic Sea could also be called the Viigree Jump at home. I believe you have noticed that Volvo has just announced that he is a fully electric car manufacturer in 2030 and that Volkswagen has set up a software centre in Tallinn to be an IT company in 2030. If the main challenges for the efficiency of mobility are perception of the surrounding environment, digital brain and software and energy storage, then Estonia already has a significant footprint in the so-called automotive industry. I congratulate our universities for laying this knowledge base, but also Elcogen\'s recent decision to establish a fuel cell production plant in Estonia. The government will certainly stand for us to have more of this smart and green industrial production. The EUR 50 million seed money from the European Re-launch Fund for hydrogen technology will hopefully provide the necessary trigger for the hydrogen revolution. I hope for a similar digital and green boost from the introduction of the Rail Baltic project, and I wish to strengthen regional and transatlantic cooperation also on Digisummit, Tallinn. We do not want to be the country with the blackest footprint in Europe, and we do not want to become the European waste heap by 2035. In the new budget period of the European Union, Estonia has a sizeable budget of EUR 3.3 billion to achieve the objective of climate neutrality. Since the green turn is essentially an energy turn towards clean energy, the government\'s decision to withdraw from the preferential development of oil shale energy for public money has finally drawn up a debate on various new opportunities and technologies. In Estonia, such a turn in a tangible future means a shift in energy production from east to west, from land to sea and from stone to wind. Tarmo Soomere, President of the Academy of Sciences, has said that the future of energy production is a windmill in the backyard. This thinking may seem as strange to us as the computer class in 1990, but if we learned anything from this era, it is that it is not about technology but, above all, about our own attitudes. Among the projects of common interest funded by the Energy Commissioner, Kadri Simson, the European offshore wind strategy and the hydrogen strategy, and the Connecting Europe Facility, priority will be given to the development of the offshore wind grid and hydrogen technology. I congratulate the previous governments for the fact that the project to synchronise the Estonian energy system with Central Europe received the EUR 720 million needed funding and is coming to the end of the connection with Europe. I am also hopeful that the joint initiative to develop the Estonian-Latvian sea wind [park] will bear fruit by 2030 and will have an inspiring effect. It is obvious, of course, that the new EU budget is not enough to realise the idea of the Baltic Sea network, and the funding should complement both the income from the emissions trade and the budget following the current period. Honourable Riigikogu! African folk wisdom is apt to say that if you want to go quickly, you go alone, and if you want to go far, you go together. And together and united, we have to go because our strategic challenges are constantly changing along with the population, the environment and technology, but they have not changed in substance. I very much hope that our deterrence and toolbox can take one step in the world with these developments. We have just launched the European strategic compass process, and I hope that in a year\'s time we will be able to measure it. From next week\'s Council, first and foremost, I expect us to have strategic patience and to reaffirm the five principles of developing relations with Russia. When we talk about selective inclusion, the best thing we can do is to involve civil society more selectively, to share our core values with our eastern neighbours, and also to make the necessary decisions in enlargement policy. The new year has begun by reaffirming close, friendly cooperation with the United States based on shared values. It is therefore gratifying that a number of topics that have strained relations have been found or are in the process of finding a solution. I hope that we will also be able to continue our cooperation with America bilaterally and as a region in the framework of the three sea summits and its follow-up activities this year, including in Tallinn Digisummit. The reopening of the world and mobility are certainly topics where there are many opportunities to find positive joint actions and initiatives. However, when we talk about a more sovereign Europe, the corona crisis alone has shown that the European Union\'s willingness and ability to cope on its own needs to be increased. There must also be an increase in Europe\'s ability and credibility to contribute to transatlantic security through the European Union\'s tools. In doing so, we must take into account that the cornerstone of Europe\'s own security is and will remain a transatlantic relationship, and therefore the debate about the military defence of the allies, their contribution to it and military operations must take place within the framework of NATO with the other allies and not behind the track and behind the back. NATO\'s main objective is to ensure the security and collective protection of its Member States. It is quite worth recalling that NATO keeps a whole billion people\'s lives safe and secure, and only half of these people live in the European Union. In fact, it should be taken into account that this other side tends to be also NATO\'s militaryly stronger side. Dear Riigikogu! First of all, I congratulate the three past governments for their effective and effective work in concluding the European Union\'s budget agreement. Last Thursday, the government also approved a proposal on the own revenues of the European Union budget, and it has already been sent to the Riigikogu for decision. I hope for constructive discussions and a swift agreement so that we can start with the investment we dreamed of and bring the future closer. As I said in the introduction to the presentation, Estonia\'s affairs are also European things and, on the contrary, strong countries make Europe strong and strong Europe also makes European countries strong. The roof strategy ""Estonia 2035"" has been completed and presented to you under the leadership of the State Chancellery. It takes account of the developments in the European Union and, being Estonia\'s long-term strategy, it also tries to guide these developments. All sectoral development plans must anticipate and be able to shape the development of Europe, at least from an Estonian perspective, and ministers will also report on these activities in the large hall. I hope that there will also be more and more talk in the large Chamber of the Riigikogu about sectoral developments in Europe. This somewhat self-centred approach does not change this fundamental principle that if Europe is doing well, Estonia will do well, but it must also strengthen the sense of ownership, interest and targeting in European policies in Estonia. Europe will never be ready, because Europe does not have, and must not have, the ultimate goal, but it is important that we care and feel responsible for its future and realise that Estonia cannot, cannot, must not be left alone. He can only be what people today want and dream he is. However, I hope that Estonians will not stop hoping and dreaming about a peaceful, protected, free and diverse Europe, because there is no Estonia without Europe and there is no Europe without Estonia. Thank you.', ""Honourable Riigikogu! Mr President, I would like to thank you very much. It is a great honour and a great pleasure to perform here. This is precisely the day when the price of electricity has fallen from 260 euros to 11 o'clock to 220 euros. Our debate has obviously been useful. But seriously, thank you for the thought of having such a debate, thank you to the inviters and organisers. My report's a little bit simpler now that Professor Koni talked about the basics more or less. On the other hand, I find it a little difficult to perform because the slides coming up on the wall show a little bit of the other [picture] when they're printed out there for you. I'm trying to talk out of printed slides because [they're fresher]. My background is that I worked 21 years in Eesti Energia and 10 years in the public service [in MKM], the next 11 years in Eesti Gaas and then 10 years in the technical university. So I should have an overview of entrepreneurship, public and private entrepreneurship, the public sector and academic life. First, maybe a couple of pictures, which were on Alar Konist. I do not think that there is any point in arguing about this or arguing about it. Like a peasant's mind, what the world is like today. The global picture was that last year, 2020 the share of fossil fuels was 83%. Is it possible, and if so, how can it be reduced or abandoned in European conditions? The next picture is about electricity generation, which we are talking about more today. Here, 61% of fossil fuels are made up of fossil fuels. Now we should go ahead and see where these 39% come from. We know that there is water, or hydropower, and nuclear power. We'll put them on, and we won't be too short, the wind and the sun will be 6% and 3%. Biofuels are, of course, things that we consider to be carbon-free in the European Union today, but in fact, they have higher specific carbon emissions than oil shale and peat. So if we still really want to cut greenhouse gases in the world, then we have to think about it. We were also talking about the structure of energy production in different countries. Of course, if the ancient god has given mountains or rivers, then the country has hydropower. In our case, he's been a little bit stingy, it's been more generous to the Finns, and it's given the Latvians a little bit of Daugava's face. So if we look at this picture just visually, we can see that our northern neighbours have a pretty good cake like this with different sources of primary energy. Let's get more specific now. What's our status today? We have a local resource for oil shale, we have a hundred-year experience of using oil shale, we have good knowledge of [in this field]. We have the resource, the ability to use it, and the knowledge of how to use it. But today's situation is that, for reasons you know, we're in a deep minus, we've become a state buying in electricity. On the basis of these tables, you can see how much we have in terms of [electricity generation] renewable sources and how much oil shale is involved. So even for the small part that we produce ourselves, the share of oil shale is lower and the share of renewable sources is higher. [In environmental improvement] we have been, I would say, extremely successful. We have set very high targets, higher than the European Union, and we have met those targets. If you look at this table, you will see that we are at the forefront of reducing CO2 emissions in the European Union. Of course it can be argued that the base year is 1990 and then the production was second, the market was second, etc., the plants were newer. But the fact remains a fact. Europe is compared to 1990, and in this we are undoubtedly in the end last year with a reduction of almost 65% [the most successful country of the European Union]. The price of CO2 was already mentioned. Here is a table containing gas prices, oil prices and CO2 quota prices. The picture's the same as Alar Kon. Here is now one of these slides, which shows a comparison of the prices of electricity and natural gas from January this year to today. Blue shows natural gas and black or dark electricity. And what can we say? The table is written, but the first conclusion is that if we see an increase in electricity prices a little over two times compared to the same period last year, the gas price has already risen about four times by now. And if you go any further from here, on your right, Gaspool, the Dutch gas exchange TTF and Get Baltic gas exchange forecasts. These are the three stock exchanges where Estonia buys gas, choosing between the three. Here, the price of the Dutch gas exchange is forecast to be not today's EUR 29 or EUR 30 in the coming winter, but EUR 130-140 in MWh. EUR 130 is estimated to be EUR 140 by November and December, January and February. Then the price starts to fall and will reach about EUR 50 in May. Electricity prices have the same forecast. What do I mean by that? What I want to say is that electricity prices and gas prices will certainly no longer fall to the level they have been, but they will remain 2 to 2.5 times as high as they were last year. And the story that the cold winter gets past and the wind starts blowing, the sun shines, and everything gets beautiful, optimism is nice, and optimists are great, but reality is [hardest]. I made a price comparison. It is important to [analyze] what are the components of the final energy price. Alar Konis has already shown the energy price structure. One is the price of goods on the market, it is electricity or gas, the other is Estonia's own regulated network charge, which is a natural monopoly, and the third is taxes imposed by the Estonian state. Taxation is subject to EU restrictions, but basically two parts of the structure are still in our own hands: taxes and regulated network charges. The eighth table in your possession on page 4 shows a certain price comparison. We talk a lot about the percentage of the price increase and that it increases twice or four times, but a person has to have a clearer picture of how big this real exit is anyway. The worst part of the price increase will affect two types of domestic consumers. Of course, the increase in prices affects each of us, right, industry, of course. We cannot say that domestic consumers are in the worst position. But electric-fired dwellings and gas-fired private homes are the ones that are still hit very seriously. Statistics say that gas-fired private homes account for about 10% of all households and 15% of all households have electricity. I took the example of my neighbours here: the average monthly consumption of electricity-fired private land is 1500 kWh per month. Last year he paid EUR 174 a month, this year he has to pay EUR 322 already in September. It's a 1.85-fold slope. The rise is slightly less than the increase in electricity's own price, precisely because taxes and network charges have remained the same. And the second comparison is central heating for a 2-to 3-room apartment. While last September the end-user price was EUR 35.5, this September the cost is EUR 63. But as I said, these prices are definitely not yet on the ceiling. In the case of gas, it is absolutely clear that it is not on the ceiling, and it still means very serious thinking. A lot of talk about wind. Here is a picture of the state of use in Estonia. Alar Konist showed how things are in the entire region, but here is the production of Estonian windmills. According to this schedule, no one is expected to be willing to consume, so there must be a regulating power that we can debug non-steering bouncing power generation. Let us now try to understand these reasons for the rise in prices. If you could shape a long view, that would be great. But first you should position yourself, know your condition. To this end, the state of the country or region must be monitored. First of all, I think that we have tried to influence the market with command-economic political decisions, and that is why we have violated market regulation. Another reason could be that, with the entry of non-controlled production into the market, the need for regulatory capacity will increase. Based on emissions, countries have shifted to less emission fuel, that is natural gas. The prices of all other fuels have risen from here. Of course, there are also objective reasons for what to say. Really, last winter was rough and the summer was warm, the water was scarce. Statistics say that the Nordic hydro resource was..21 TWh. Estonia's consumption is just under 8 TWh. It has still been a very large underage of water reservoirs. Of course, this year's conditions have also sought to achieve [the objectives]. CO2 quotas on the market will be reduced and free quotas will, of course, no longer exist. The second factor that affects the trade in CO2 quotas is that if you look at how this trade works, there are a lot of so-called financial investors who buy up quotas. We'll call them whatever they want, but we'll be polite to say they're brokers. Business activities have arisen between the price of quotas, which should not be allowed. What else? I don't know what else to say about this. The next issue is what is at the heart of energy. The balance in the energy economy is fundamental. On your fifth page there is one triangle that shows the interaction between security of supply, affordability and environmental change. Security of supply means that energy, be it what it is, must be available at all times in the amount required for us. Next thing you know, he's got to be affordable, so we can buy it in the first place. Technology allows a lot, but do you want to match the consumer's wallet? And the third factor is the environment. If we take this triangle out of balance, there is no point in blaming the market. We have, by our own political decisions, pushed the energy economy out of balance. At the moment, we are a little overstretched by a single parameter in the triangle, and we are faced with the fact that affordability is no longer guaranteed. There is no single European or European Union energy market, much of which is said. Different regions have different prices and different prices also exist in the Baltic States, not to mention the Nordic countries and other continental Europe. One more remark on renewable energy. Surely renewable energy is something that needs to be developed and developed, both for us and for others. We've had a little glitch here by the Department of Defense and for other reasons, but they've already been eliminated. So I'm sure there'll be more wind farms in the sea and on land. But let's see what happened. The renewable energy charge was introduced in 2007. Then we started paying for it. Renewable energy has risen seven times and it has come out of the consumer's pocket. How much progress we've made on this, isn't it a point of thought or analysis? I am not the one telling us whether we have also received better technology, better quality and cheaper energy for this reward. You can think for yourself. The next issue is the stability and production of wind farms. It's very clear today. We have wind farms with a capacity of 330 MW. How do they work? If we look at this year again, we see that they have a coefficient of use of 25%. This means that wind farms account for 25% of 330 MW capacity. So 75% of the energy must come from somewhere else. The renewable energy fee is on average EUR 100 million per year, which our consumer pays, Elering distributes this renewable energy fee among producers. In 2021 it is planned to reach 90.1 million. Now what? A bit of a philosophical question about what we have here. Again, we ourselves, the legislator in this Chamber as well as in other halls, should think about whether it is theoretically possible to abandon fossil fuels at all. All of you, including me, are dressed for oil. Maybe we'll go over to fibre pulp and get some paper clothes, but it'll take a little while. By the way, VKG is planning to build such a pulp factory. Energy inputs - this is my subjective opinion - we do not have enough. We do not have enough energy sources to increase GDP all the time and thus participate in the ranking. At the same time, urbanisation and globalisation are well known to you, so the next problem is logistics. We're gonna move the merchandise from one place to another, get strawberries from Greece, and get something back from here. Next, electricity consumption is bound to increase, no matter what we think about it. Why is it increasing? Electricity is the most convenient form of energy, its use is most convenient, so its consumption will certainly increase. But when it comes to recording and transportation, the batteries, and all of this, we also have to consider where this metal comes from. We're talking lithium batteries, where's the lithium? What is the world's supply of lithium, and who has the discoveries? I think we should think about it again. If you look at the technologies that we proudly say today that we are going to start with the batteries and hydrogen technology, etc., then look at history. These are all technologies, not the last one, but the last one. We haven't invented very advanced technology anywhere. And the last thing that's not for me to say is that there have been wars for energy before and today, and I'm afraid there will be wars in the future. Now, here's a picture that also tells us about our energy balance. Professor Konis told us how our adjustable power's going down. Here you can see with your numbers all the power plants we have today and what we predict will continue to work. Last year we were still in surplus with 215 MW, but in 2031 we are almost 1,000, or 900 MW, minus. Why 2031? Because additional capacity will fall out in 2030. Now that we're thinking about the future, today we're dealing with the consequences. But it would be better to think ahead and into the future so that such situations, such price shocks, do not arise. Here we need to make it very clear to ourselves that a cleaner climate requires much more money. And now our own question is how we set these values for ourselves. Are we willing to pay more? Are we willing to give up comfort, even partially? It is such a matter of outlook or attitude. Next is a purely technical question. We were only 2% energy dependent, which means that Estonia was practically energy independent. Now we are becoming increasingly dependent on energy from elsewhere every year. Question: what does that mean? Certainly, regulatory capacities, or controlled capacities, must come to the system. I would argue that the more non-regulatory power comes, the greater the need for regulatory power. All the circular economy that we have today in the oil shale sector, from the use of ash, from the rubble of all this, let alone the chemical industry, is certainly one of Estonia's future opportunities. And what I'm saying is that with business closures, with orders, we don't improve the climate. Still, it's the technologies that have to go on this day. Surely our future is, as we say, a combined energy mix. I would like to look at another aspect for about three minutes: that we should anticipate, not deal with the consequences. We've got a four-D movement in electro-energy. One is what we have talked about a lot today: decarbonisation, carbon-free production. The next is decentralisation, distributed production, which was also a question. The third is desynchronous, which means changing the synchronous area of the electricity system. And fourth is digitalization. We really need to think about whether we have the strength. One very wise person has asked one great man if there is still enough gunpowder for these four Ds, if there is still some sense, money, and opportunity. And here's a picture where the red crosses mark the break-up points for the electricity system from the Russian and Belarusian systems. Next slide. Here's a picture that shows where we are today. This is now the next triangle. We were talking about the equilibrium triangle. That's the triangle we're in today. I do not want to argue that we must, in any case, maintain the current situation. The Treaty of Lisbon of the European Union says that Member States must have common infrastructures and common principles, but any change also requires a very thorough analysis of three areas: social, political and economic risk. We need to know that. As a result of planning our ten-year unification, one side of the triangle, which passes through the Baltic States, has been shifted with Russian Federation investments on the other side of Lake Peipsi. In fact, the Estonian electricity system is no longer needed in Russia, and it can be given by God that it will not do this one day to say that I will help you, we will separate ourselves from the Baltic electricity system, so be on your own. And then we're in a pretty complicated situation. Now, what would these price relief suggestions be? The first would probably be to look at the national taxes included in the energy end-user price package. Surely the country should now still face the consumer and see what can be done. The first one is the renewable energy charge, but it is not a classic tax, but it can be considered that way. This should not be collected by consumers from EUR 100 million. For this reason, this source of cover is very simple. The price of the CO2 quota has increased, electricity production has increased due to high prices, and now more quotas have been bought, so more money will be received from the state budget than from the emissions trade. There's talk of an overload of about 120 million. So I'm sure my proposal would be to give it up. The second proposal is the VAT reduction proposed in the past. A reduction in VAT from 20% to 9% would mean that we would reduce the consumer's final balance by 11%. And the source of this relief would be the same value added tax, which is actually more due to higher electricity prices. If you look at this table, there's electricity prices on page four, that's where it's coming out. The third one, which we could certainly review, would be the decision to shut down oil shale energy. If we have now decided to close down electricity and oil production at different times, then the decision to close down electricity generation will actually end oil shale energy. The question is whether it is reasonable. Do we have anything to replace in energy, politics and socio-economic terms? This should be discussed and taken very seriously of the requirement made by the previous government today that Eesti Energia should maintain the regulated capacity of 1000 MW. It's very good, and it'll help us manage today. But the question is, it's valid until 2023. I don't think there's gonna be any relief. We must definitely extend this requirement. And the decision to close means not to invest. The accident of our oil shale capacity is increasing because they are not invested in it, and they must be repaired. And, of course, what has been said a great deal about: 350 million of fair transitions are not enough to simply change the structure of the oil shale region's labour market by comparing environmental resources, all taxes and so on. You're not gonna do anything with that money. Alar Konist had many German examples here. Take a similar region of Germany, a coal area, to move it, one step more money has been put in motion. So, what else is domestic? There is certainly a need to develop energy economy research. I am thinking here of technology, recording, new technologies, and, in the case of fossil fuels, capture, use, storage. Network charges should certainly be differentiated according to the structure of energy production. That's pretty sure. Perhaps the possibility of time shifting investments in network charges should also be reviewed. KredEx, quite clearly, energy efficiency is one important thing. But the amount currently planned for the housing fund or building fund through KredEx is 50 years of renovation of buildings. Some buildings will collapse before they can be renovated. At the same time, maybe it's pretty good. And, of course, a compensation mechanism must be developed for the poorer part of the population. Long-term measures are those that should also be negotiated with the European Union's partners. The first is an analysis of the entire emissions trading system. I'm not saying that this system is wrong, but what I'm saying is that this system is not working today. Why isn't he working? First of all, the reasons should be understood, analysed. And, of course, together with our partners, we also need to think about whether we can improve the world with our 8% or 9%. This trade in emissions should also extend to other countries. And maybe you could get a free quota on a temporary basis. Of course, I doubt that very much. However, in any case, the system must be reviewed, even for the simple reason that, when this system was made, the price of CO2 was €15/20, today is €60. The situation has simply changed and feedback is relevant in every instance. In shaping energy policy, we should always be careful not to have one specific section that windmills provide electricity without money. Good, yeah, the wind doesn't ask for money. But where did this windmill come from, and where does this windmill go, or the solar panel? The whole cycle of life must always be taken into account; all things must be compared. But you can still compare things on equal terms. In order to mitigate the risks, we need the widest possible energy portfolio, with a large number of primary energy types in both national and regional views. One slide here also showed that this is the case in other countries. And thirdly, we still have to agree on what this declared solidarity between European countries means. If one country is in crisis and has no energy, does it really work? I don't think it's enough to want or believe. There should be a very clear set of rules.""]","<|system|>

The selection criteria shall assess, inter alia, the impact on energy security, market integration, competitiveness and sustainability. With regard to the latter criterion, the role of gas as a transition fuel is also recognised. In Belgium, too, this fuel has a significant share in almost all long-term scenarios for reasons of flexibility and security of supply. It goes without saying that the ultimate decarbonisation of the gas sector is necessary in order to achieve the European Paris objective. I therefore look forward to the outcome of the European Commission and its evaluation of the TEN-E Regulation within the context of its Green Deal. I'm going to ask what that acronym is. I don't like to use acronyms without knowing the meaning of them. Your second question concerns the European climate law. The European Commission alone has the right of initiative to propose new European legislation, such as the proposal of European climate law announced before 4 March. Member States are not involved in the preparation of legislative proposals and only play a role in the negotiations in the Council of the European Union. In this context, the Belgian position will have to be developed in coordination between all competent authorities. In this case, the preparation is in the hands of a network of the International Environmental Policy Coordination Committee under the direction of my administration and is then validated in the Directorate-General for Coordination, organised by the Foreign Affairs Office. In view of the cross-cutting and cross-disciplinary nature of the proposals under the European Green Deal, of which the Climate Act forms part, it is of the utmost importance that the DGE consultation ensures transparency and involvement of all relevant departments at federal level and at the level of the federated entities. The current NEFPs are part of a European target to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990. This objective was consistent with an emission reduction of 80% by 2050. In the meantime, however, we know that we are not achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement with such long-term objectives, which is why the European Council decided that the EU should become climate neutral by 2050. The European Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) by Horizon 2030 will also need to be reviewed. In the context of the ambition cycle under the Paris Agreement, Belgium, together with the Netherlands and Luxembourg in the Benelux-Talanoa Declaration, called for a review of the European NDCs and invited the Commission to examine options to strengthen the European 2030 target as soon as possible. The European Council of 12 December also invited the Commission, following a thorough impact assessment and well before COP 26, to submit a proposal for updating the European NDCs. The Commission's Von der Leyen has already announced a proposal to increase the 2030 target to 50% or even 55% on the basis of an in-depth impact analysis. I call for the proposal and the impact assessment to be published as soon as possible, as it is essential to start the European debate on this issue so that we encourage the other parties at international level to also show ambition and move forward. Once the new 2030 target has been set, it needs to be translated into European legislation. By 2021, the Commission will announce proposals to adapt the ETS Directive, the Efficiency Sharing Regulation and other European legislation to the new 2030 target. It is within the framework of the EC ESA that an increase in the national non-ETS target will be set, followed by an adjustment of the NEFPs. Mrs Daems, I know by now what the acronym TEN-E means. Those are the Trans-European Networks for Energy. Your third question concerned the public survey on the ETS. The current compensation scheme expires at the end of this year. That is why the European Commission is organising a public consultation on the subject. The exercise is also in the context of the revised European Directive which provides that a Member State should endeavour to spend no more than 25% of its auction revenues on compensating indirect costs. Since 2018, a Member State that does not comply with that provision should publish a motivation report in the event of an overrun. Flanders compensated 46.87 million euros in 2016 or 82% of auction revenues and 31.71 million euros in 2017 or 42% of auction revenues. This makes Flanders the absolute European frontrunner. That's good news. Wallonia entered the system on 6 July 2018. The consultation on the subject between the Regions and the federal government is still ongoing. The submission took place on 10 March this year. It is primarily the Departments of Economics of the Regions, which follow up the file. There was a discussion on 3 March to amend the text. The draft position assumes that the reform of the EU ETS should strike a good balance, linking more ambitious objectives and increasing incentives to invest with effective carbon leakage protection. It is pointed out that it is very important for our country, with an important presence of energy-intensive and electro-intensive industries, to adopt a similar approach in the selection of eligible sectors to protect against indirect carbon leakage, as used for direct carbon leakage. Moreover, the scheme should provide a stable framework to compensate for the most exposed sectors. This should therefore be as consistent as possible with the recent reform of the EU ETS. It is also argued that the CO2 figure should be aligned with the real costs paid by the companies in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. Finally, there are a number of technical questions for clarification. I believe that state aid should help to ensure further investment in energy efficiency and innovation by anchoring the recipient industries here. Federal aid to companies under energy policy agreements or inter-branch agreements should also be sufficient to encourage continuous improvement and avoid additional efforts and a carbon lock-in. With a view to an almost completely decarbonised industry by 2050, the European Green Deal also aims to achieve a steady reduction in carbon leakage protection. The introduction of border adjustment measures in line with WTO rules could create an elegant level playing field, while auction revenues could be more targeted towards the most difficult emission reductions. As far as your fourth question is concerned, I cannot agree with your statement on the perverse effect that the ETS makes additional policies meaningless. The EU ETS puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions, which is one of the most important instruments of European climate policy. Contrary to the introduction of a carbon price-fixing tax, but without a view of final emissions levels, the ETS provides an absolute ceiling on emissions. It is essential from the point of view of environmental integrity. Moreover, the system allows flexibility between installations at EU level, favouring the most efficient installations and achieving the most cost-effective reduction options. While the economic crisis and the influx of international credits created a surplus on the market, we have set up the market stability reserve for this purpose. This could also strengthen the cap in the event of additional efforts going beyond what is foreseen and leading to surpluses on the market, which would result in more rights being placed in the reserve and cancelled. With regard to achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement and, in particular, the target of limiting temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the basis for EU policy is now the goal of being climate neutral by 2050. As you know, the European Commission is now translating this objective into concrete proposals under the European Green Deal. In March, we received a proposal to anchor climate neutrality in an EU regulation and by the summer the Commission announced that it would present an impact analysis of its proposal to reduce EU emissions by 50% by 2030 or even 55% below 1990 levels. This impact analysis will need to demonstrate to what extent EU policies will need to be adjusted. This includes evaluating and adjusting the slope of the linear reduction path under the EU ETS, as you call it, indeed. So I am sure that the current ETS cap is not in line with our new objectives and will need to be further strengthened in the coming year, but also the targets for Member States under the Efficiency Sharing Regulation, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Directives, CO2 standards for cars, energy tax, etc. will be needed. In the Green Deal, the Commission also announces legislative proposals for these key elements of EU policy by June 2021. In other words, you are very far-sighted with your rightful question. Although emissions in the ETS sectors are regulated at European level, I have never wanted to claim that there can and must be no additional policy, including at national level, to help those industries make the transition to climate neutrality. The EU ETS provides for a partial internalisation of public emissions costs by charging a uniform carbon price. As there are other barriers and market failures in addition to the need for a price signal, it is essential to develop additional policies for the ETS sectors, in particular on innovation, public infrastructure and the encouragement of behavioural changes and synergies between sectors. In this context, I also refer to the vision paper of my administration in preparation for the Belgian long-term strategy, which identifies a number of strategic yards for these sectors, such as the development of industrial roadmaps, mapping and scaling up strategies and plans for a circular economy, focusing on the challenges and opportunities for electro-intensive industries, and developing a vision and framework for the use of biomass, hydrogen, e-fuels and carbon storage. We must also ensure that workers in those sectors where employment could be under pressure are accompanied and retrained in order to be able to enter the new economy that we must start building today. With regard to the issue of intra-European flights, firstly, we must take into account the market stability reserve, which can partly offset the waterbed effect, which would absorb an effort by the system and free up space for other emissions. Secondly, it seems clear to me that intra-European rail transport rather than short flights is a cost-effective way of reducing emissions. As the EU ETS encourages the most cost-effective reductions, this shift is encouraged. However, this change is at the same time prevented by other factors, such as the fact that we do pay VAT on train tickets but not on airline tickets, the tax exemption for kerosene, and the lack of efficient integration and cooperation of rail traffic within the Union which would make it easier and cheaper to travel pan-Europeanly. That is where we need to discuss the approach to international transport, not the ETS, but additional initiatives to ensure equal treatment of rail and air traffic. I would like to emphasise that the inclusion of intra-European air transport in the ETS has been a very good thing since 2013. Previously, these emissions were covered by international bunkers and were not monitored at European level. These intra-EU aviation emissions are now covered by a separate sub-category with separate allowances, and this additional aviation emission space was set at 95% of the industry's average emissions between 2004 and 2006. In the meantime, it is clear that this additional space is insufficient to absorb sector growth. For example, the aviation sector had to purchase nearly 27 million tonnes of duty in 2017. For comparison, the total Flemish ETS emissions amounted to 32 million tonnes in 2017. As you can see, the inclusion of aviation does contribute to the ETS pricing process. From 2021 onwards, intra-EU aviation will also be subject to the decreasing emission ceiling and the rights of fixed installations and aviation will be interchangeable and the use of additional European rights will also be prohibited. Finally, I acknowledge that the EU ETS is not perfect. However, let us not throw the child away with the bath water. The expression also exists in the French version and put the whole system at risk, now that it has finally begun to generate a more significant carbon price than at the start of the system. On the other hand, let us concentrate on finding solutions to the remaining problems and on providing our companies with a framework that will help to make the transition to a climate-neutral Europe. Thank you for your attention."", ""Madam President, I will deal with COP26, the delayed climate summit that is the subject of this sitting, but I will also link it where necessary with the processes that are currently under way in Europe and Belgium. I will start with a very logical statement, namely it is not because the corona crisis has shut down the world that the climate crisis has stopped. We have already seen several dramatic consequences of the climate crisis this year, forest fires in California and floods in Uganda. We are also increasingly seeing more and more serious consequences in Belgium. So the urgency has not disappeared and we think it is necessary to repeat it here. It was therefore important that you organised this session because it is not because there is no climate summit in 2020 that there can and should be no climate action this year. There are still important moments this year as the deadline for ambition and international climate financing covered 2020, not COP26. This means that things must be done this year, despite the delay of the COP. There are two important international moments where progress is needed, the UNFCCC Climate Change Dialogues from the end of November to early December, about the time when negotiations would normally have taken place, and a climate summit organised by the COP26 Presidency and UN Secretary-General Guterres on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, 12 December. If I understand correctly, both international events will continue virtually. The latter is counting on the presence of Heads of State or Government to commit themselves to ambitions and other matters. The main issues on the COP26 agenda are the ambitions, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement or the carbon markets and a number of equity issues that come back to the climate summit every year. I shall now turn briefly to these various points. I will not dwell too long on the ambitions because they have already been dealt with. Basically, the 2020 deadline is there and we want the European Union to play a leading role in making the commitments set out in the Green Deal work, knock and submit. This should preferably be done as soon as possible in order to fully fulfil the role of climate diplomacy. We must be able to demonstrate that we have done our homework and submitted the new plan, after which we can look at the other major polluters in the world to do the same. As has just been said, there are still two European Councils where this can be knocked off, in October and December. In the light of climate diplomacy, it is important that a decision be taken in October, so that a new plan can be submitted and that Belgium takes an active role in it and does present itself as one of the pioneers of increasing ambition to at least 55% by 2030. What does all this mean for Belgium and the interparliamentary climate dialogue? The European Union will increase the objective. That dynamic is there. The European Commission wants it. The European Parliament wants it. The European Parliament has already voted for 60% reduction at European level. The Belgian National Energy and Climate Plan will therefore have to be adapted. This decision will have an impact on Belgium's objectives. Many countries are already increasing their national plans. It is now up to Belgium to start doing so. This should not be delayed until the objective is fixed and divided. It is clear that we will have to make a firm effort. We need to get started on that right now. The interparliamentary climate dialogue must initiate this dynamic in order to start discussions and make a real difference. For example, the new National Energy and Climate Plan can be based on sufficient ambition, cooperation and strengthening the regions and the federal government to achieve this ambition together. The carbon markets are extremely important and it is extremely important that these markets are properly designed. They have the potential to completely undermine the Paris Agreement. We have a lot to say about that. It is also a very technical matter. We'll deal with that next year. Then I can come and explain the matter in great detail. In other words, the markets must be properly designed so that they do not undermine the Paris Agreement. Human rights and the importance of sustainable development in these carbon markets must also be taken into account. Under the Kyoto Protocol, we have seen that this was often not the case. Another important issue is the financing of loss and damage. However, I will not dwell on that either. This issue is very important for next year. With regard to international climate financing, I will dwell on the fact that there is an important Belgian part there, for which we are looking at the iInterparliamentary climate dialogue. This deals with the promised funding under the UN Climate Treaty of historical polluters, the rich countries to developing countries to assist them in their climate challenges. This therefore concerns low-carbon development and adaptation to the effects of the climate crisis already in place. There, too, the deadline was set for 2020. The rich countries have promised to provide USD 100 billion annually for this funding from 2020. An important topic that will also be discussed at COP26 is looking ahead to a new target by 2025, but that too has been postponed to next year. I will look into what that means for Belgium later on. What are we looking at this interparliamentary climate dialogue for? What topics does the Climate Coalition see as a priority at the moment? At the moment that is not COP26 because it has moved to next year, but that does not mean that there are no other important issues to discuss. Nicolas has already looked more closely at the reconstruction, which should be in function of achieving the sustainable development objectives and climate objectives. For us, this also seems to be an interesting subject for the interparliamentary climate dialogue, in order to ensure that relance is carried out in this way and that the same mistakes are not repeated as in the past. Another point is climate governance. It is on your agenda, and you have a meeting on this in December. That's important. So I will not dwell too much on this, too, but I would just like to reiterate that climate governance is putting a huge brake on climate ambition, climate cooperation and climate policy in Belgium. A thorough reform of this is needed. There's a new federal government. This means that there are now fully-fledged governments once again that can take important steps. The federal government's coalition agreement contains a number of commitments to better co-operate with the Länder and a number of proposals to address climate governance. So we are really looking at the coming months to take steps and the interparliamentary climate dialogue to tackle this in depth. Another issue that is very closely linked to this is the distribution of the climate targets for 2030. I would remind you of what happened in 2020. Those objectives were negotiated for years behind closed doors, which made it too late to start implementing them at the time the distribution was completed. We must avoid this in the 2030 debate. We are also looking at you to ask for transparency about this. Where are these talks taking place? Are they working on it yet? Who's in what position? Are we taking into account the increase in ambition that is coming? That is also important, because if we divide now on the basis of the current ambition and not look to the future, then we can start again soon. These are a number of important issues in which you can certainly play a role. I will conclude with one final point: international climate finance. This is also a subject for which we are really looking at Belgium and the interparliamentary climate dialogue. There's that strong link to COP26. That's why I'm getting into it a little bit more now. There is the link with international negotiations in general, but above all, there is a momentum. There is currently a commitment from Belgium to spend EUR 50 million per year on climate finance until 2020. This means that a new commitment will have to be made as of next year. Actually, there's a momentum to talk about that right now. It is necessary to clarify as soon as possible what this funding will be for Belgium. What are we asking of Belgium? We are asking for a very drastic increase in funding. Belgium has contributed EUR 50 million so far, and that has been its commitment since the start of climate finance. So there is no increase in this, while international promises were made that this would increase. Fifty million euros is a particularly small contribution in the light of an international target of USD 100 billion. We have actually been asking for years to increase it. We have now also calculated how much the Belgian contribution should be. We have calculated this on the basis of the capacity that Belgium has, that is, the wealth of our country, but also the responsibility that Belgium has in causing the climate crisis. Those are two principles that are also embedded in the UN Climate Treaty, which is not taken out of the blue. Those are really principles that determine what countries should do. On this basis, we have calculated that a fair contribution from Belgium is EUR 500 million per year. It is important to note that this funding should not weigh on the budget of development cooperation. At present, almost all of the climate finance we provide from Belgium is also reported as development cooperation. At the same time, the budget for development cooperation is falling, reducing overall resources rather than additional resources. That is a very big problem. Why are we now looking at the interparliamentary climate dialogue to work around it? It is a Belgian commitment, but it is both the regions and the federal government that contribute to international climate financing. There must therefore be an agreement between these different entities on what the Belgian commitment will be in the coming years. This is also linked to the effort sharing for 2030. The 2020 targets included renewable energy, emissions, targets, climate finance and the distribution of emissions trading revenues. That will probably be linked now, so it is also linked to the discussion about effort sharing. International climate finance is an issue that comes up very high on the agenda every time there are international negotiations and has an important impact on confidence in the negotiations and on the position that countries can take on these negotiations. For this reason, it is also an important issue to coordinate between the Länder and the federal government. That is why we are looking at the interparliamentary climate dialogue to make this work. You have already discussed this in the discussion of the previous interparliamentary climate resolution. There are a number of points that we are putting forward for the interparliamentary climate dialogue. Above all, we want to stress that we are convinced of the strength of the dialogue and that we certainly want to maintain it. We must also strengthen this dialogue in the light of climate governance that is stuck at other levels. It really is a driving force for better climate cooperation in Belgium. We certainly want to emphasise that. Some of the issues we put forward are the relance post-corona in a fair and sustainable way, transparency in the distribution of 2030 targets and international climate finance."", 'Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to address a few more questions that you had after the explanatory statement by myself and Minister Marghem at the previous meeting of this committee. I hope that this can continue to serve the debate on climate policy in general. As the President pointed out, I will, of course, try to answer the questions that have been put directly to me, but perhaps anticipating the intervention of the Minister later, I suppose, I will also give some information relating to the questions that have been put to the Minister. For starters, I hope I respect the order here. I may begin with the questions that Mr Van Hees has put to the Minister, and I would like to give some technical clarifications for some of them, in particular with regard to the first question, assuming that the current emission reduction is 1% per year, which is qualified by the questioner as a largement insuffisant. We have looked at the historical reduction rate for all sectors, for the emissions of Belgium as a whole, i.e. non-ETS and ETS, and then more specifically for the non-ETS sectors, because Belgian and federal policies have or can have a greater impact on this than in the ETS sectors, which are, of course, largely determined by European policies. First of all, perhaps a historical perspective. Where the questioner posted a figure of 1%, according to our figures for the period 2005-2017 for all emissions together, both ETS and non-ETS, emissions in Belgium decreased by 1.77 % per year. If one only looks at the non-ETS sectors, i.e. mainly buildings and transport, in addition to agriculture and waste, the annual reduction rate from 2005 to 2017 is 0.85%. That\'s for further clarification. Let us compare this with the linear reduction rates that would be necessary to move towards our 2030 target in the non-ETS sectors. You will remember the -35 % that Belgium has to achieve in these sectors compared to 2005. If a linear trajectory is drawn from 2017 to 2030, this means an emission reduction of 1.81 % per year compared to 2005. Let us then look further, because, of course, climate policy is currently looking very much at the longer term, at horizon 2050. If we were to adopt the same emission reduction rate for Belgium for the non-ETS sectors as the emission reduction rate set by the European Commission in its long-term strategy, in a scenario aiming at carbon neutrality within the 1.5 °C target, i.e. a reduction of 86 to 87 % by 2050 compared to 2005, this would mean that the emission reduction rate in Belgium should be 2.6 % on an annual basis between 2030 and 2050, i.e. from the 35 % to that 86 % or 87 %. We have also carried out a small sensitivity analysis. If the fork of 80 to 95 %, which has been widely used so far, were to be used as the final destination of the route in 2050, an annual emission reduction of 2.3 % and a scenario of 95 % would result in an annual emission reduction of 3.1 %. Each of these scenarios involves a plurality of the historic path, as we have noted between 2005 and today. I would like to explain this in more detail to Mr Van Hees\' first question. The last part of Mr Van Hees\'s fifth question refers to climate coaches. In order to avoid any confusion, I would like to give you some more information. Our administration supervises that project and also initiated it in 2017, so a while before the peak in public attention and comments on the role of climate coaches in that context. Let me give you some key figures on the activities of these climate coaches. First of all, what do they do? They go to the third degree in secondary schools to guide classes in a debate on climate change. There is a piece of information on the impact of climate change and on policy in this area. Very specifically, the climate coaches are also provided by our administration with a tool, My2050. This is a simplified model that allows students to work on drawing up their own long-term journey. Thus, by putting more or less ambition first in all sectors, they can model a carbon-neutral or non-carbon future. The aim is therefore to have a debate on this issue. The aim is to make young people understand what the challenges are and not just in terms of the demands of the climate according to science. This seems clear when one looks at the slogans during the climate debates. It is also about what this means in terms of the system transition needed in our society. That happens with great success, so far. Since 2017, our climate coaches have been intervening 500 times in schools, where they have been able to reach more than ten thousand students. Those students, I told you, started working with the My2050 Web Tool. We have already been able to record more than 5,000 scenarios, made by the young people themselves, leading to reductions of 80% to 95% by 2050. I thought it would be useful for you to objectify the role of climate coaches, because we have often seen them discussed in a political context on which, of course, I am not speaking. This is the further explanation of the subject of the sixth question from Mr Van Hees\'s series of questions to Minister Marghem, which contains two parts. The first question concerns the fact that Belgium did not join the High Ambition Coalition at COP24 in Katowice. You may well be well aware of the dynamics of this in Belgium. I would particularly like to give some information on the second part of Mr Van Hees\' question. Wouldn\'t it be? no better than Belgium takes a leading position internationally? Even though Belgium has not been able to join the statement of the High Ambition Coalition prior to the COP24, and I recommend that you read that document at the initiative of Belgium and in the framework of the Belgian Presidency of the Benelux Union, last year, a political statement was agreed between Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, the Benelux Talanoa Declaration. It was presented at COP24. There are many things in this, but in particular in the context of the ambition debate, there is a very explicit invitation to the European Commission to examine, within three months of the COP24, options to increase the European NDC\'s 2030 European objective, in the context of long-term pathways, consistent with carbon neutrality. That is one explanation of the role Belgium has played in the past few months in terms of leadership. More recently, in February, there was also the international conference on climate and oceans, where the Brussels Declaration ""The Ocean and Climate Change"" was approved. It has now been signed by more than 30 countries and a number of organisations. Because the link between climate and oceans is so great, it also contains a message of necessary ambition and refers to the summit organised by UN Secretary-General Guterres. I think I told you something about this at my presentation at the last sitting. It looks forward to this summit as an opportunity to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. More specifically, it is also a call on all parties to the Paris Agreement, as the Secretary-General explicitly asks, to discuss at the summit the possibilities to elaborate on their NDCs or targets to be set at the United Nations by 2020, in line with long-term strategies, consistent with a carbon neutrality pathway. As far as these two examples are concerned, Belgium has taken on a leadership role. Finally, Mr Van Hees asked a question about the carbon price. Another question was asked about this, so perhaps I will come back to it in a little more detail later. In essence, the question was about the social impact of a possible carbon price. I anticipate what I will tell you later. The potentially negative redistributing impact of the carbon price has been a determining factor from the outset, one of the pillars of the analysis and consultation work that our department has carried out on behalf of the Minister over the past two years in the context of the national carbon price debate. With your permission, Mr President, I shall turn to the questions put to me and the Minister by the CD&V Group. Some of the questions asked to the Minister seem to me to be of a factual and technical nature, and so I will try to answer some of them. The first question concerns the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions achieved by the federal government so far. This question was put to the Minister. In the context of the national burden-sharing agreement, but actually much longer than that, our administration carries out an assessment of the impact of the federal measures about every two years. The last time we did that was in July 2017. I can give you some figures on the evaluated impact per period. For the first Kyoto commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, it was 20.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, an average of 4.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. This corresponds to about 4% of emissions in 2005. For the present period, we have to look back in part and look forward in part. For the period 2013 to 2018, the federal measures would amount to 56.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents, an average of 9.4 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year or 6% of emissions in 2005. We also first looked at the impact in ETS and non-ETS sectors. There was 64% impact in the non-ETS sectors and 36% in the ETS sectors. The impact on the ETS sectors is mainly the result of the federal policy on electricity consumption and on production. Plant production is one of the sectors covered by ETS. If we look ahead to the impact over the entire current period from 2013 to 2020, we estimate that the total emission reduction will be 86.6 million tonnes or 10.8 million tonnes per year, which corresponds to about 7% of emissions in 2005. The distribution between ETS and non-ETS sectors is broadly the same as I just mentioned, except for a few percent. I will give more details about the measures later. As I mentioned, the impact in the ETS sectors is mainly felt by measures that indirectly affect electricity production. As I said, it is an obligation for the federal government in the context of the burden-sharing cooperation agreement. Now, that cooperation agreement also states that the methodology used by the federal government must be approved by the National Climate Commission, but the National Climate Commission has not yet managed to reach an agreement on the methodology. To what I am told, that is, firstly, because there would be disagreement as to what could be charged as new and existing policies and, secondly, because federal product policy was partly developed in our context in order to implement the European Ecodesign Directive. There is therefore a disagreement in the National Climate Committee between the representatives of the four governments represented on which measures and measures do not count. I would add that point to my speech, because the figures I give you have not been validated by that body because of the internal blockades. I replied to the second question on the percentage share. What is the specific impact of each federal government policy measure? That is the third question put to Minister Marghem. The whole list of measures is available in the study I have just referred to. I can get you the study. She is also consultable on the website of the National Climate Commission and on our website. It\'s a very long list. In the first instance, therefore, I shall confine myself to the measures with the greatest impact. I will start with the period 2013-2020, then give you the figures for the period 2021-2030. It concerns the impact of existing policies on the period covered by the national energy and climate plan. The Ecodesign Directive in Belgium falls within the competence of the federal government. The expected impact of the Ecodesign Directive........ I will confine myself to the impact on the non-ETS sectors.............................................................................................................................................................................. That is the measure that, according to our analysis, has the greatest impact. This is followed by the now abolished ""non-life insurance"" measure, which still works through ""tax benefits"" to promote energy efficiency in households. If one only looks at effort sharing, the impact is greater. The impact is 17 755,4 kilotons of CO2 equivalents over the whole period. Offshore wind is also important, but has no impact on the non-ETS sectors. The impact on the ETS sectors is 10 618 kilotons of CO2 equivalents. As far as biofuels are concerned, if we remain within the context of renewable fuels, they are expected to have an impact of 10 959,2 kilotons of C02 equivalents over the period 2013-2020. Finally, the European Regulation on the phasing out of the use and emission of fluorinated greenhouse gases is also expected to have a significant impact in Belgium. I will end this list with the most significant policy measure, the tax deduction for energy savings, which would account for 2 473,1 kilotons of CO2 equivalents in the non-ETS sectors. These were the measures for the period 2013-2020. I now come to the period 2021-2030. These are not measures implemented in view of the national energy and climate plan, as the analysis dates back to 2017, long before the draft national energy and climate plan was adopted. For reference I give a number of figures for that period. These figures are the continuation of the policy adopted prior to the establishment of the NEFP. As regards the energy label, there are 41 445.7 kilotons of CO2 equivalent for the period 2021-2030. The fiscal advantage of energy efficiency investments by households, which is still ongoing, accounts for 19 752.5 kilotons. Offshore winds in the ETS sectors may not really fit into the list, but it is useful to know...... is good for 27 463.4 kilotons. The tax deduction for energy savings represents 2 884,7 kilotons, the biofuels 23 536,6 kilotons and the fluorinated greenhouse gases 20 635,2 kilotons. That is the further detailing of the global figures, which I have just given you. The federal government has committed itself in the co-operation agreement on Burden Sharing 2013-2020 to continue the existing policy in proportion to 15 000 kilotons of CO2 equivalents and 7 000 kilotons of CO2 equivalents to take new measures over that period. Will this additional reduction in emissions be achieved? According to our estimates, yes. The emission reduction achieved by additional policies would even far exceed 7 000 kilotons and would amount to 14 879 kilotons over the period 2016-2020. The measures identified in that context are, among other things, l\'algacation mobilité positive.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Specific questions were asked as to how much electricity the windmills produce in the North Sea. We do not manage this ourselves and I do not have the figures per year. Between 2009, the year of the first connection of offshore wind turbines to the Belgian network, and 2018, the current installations, these wind turbines together produced 16 872 gigawatthure, or 1.45 megaton oil equivalents. The target for renewable energy on horizon 2020 is for Belgium at 13% of gross final energy consumption. Now, the percentage share of offshore electricity, i.e. the contribution of the federal government via offshore wind turbines, amounts to 17% of the total Belgian effort. I would also like to inform you that, in the longer term, by 2030 horizon, Belgium has proposed to the European Commission a renewable energy target of 18.3% for itself in the draft national energy and climate plan. The increased share of offshore wind to 4 gigawatt installed power would amount to 22% of the Belgian effort. The following question goes a bit wider: will Belgium meet its climate targets for horizon 2020? I assume that it concerns the objectives in the non-ETS sectors, i.e. the -15% on horizon 2020 compared to 2005. To this end, I must first remind you that Belgium\'s obligation in the context of European legislation not only involves achieving that -15 % by 2020, but also to achieve a number of annual targets along a linear path over the period 2013-2020. That is important, I think, for your reading of my answer to this question. If we were to look only at 2020, we would not have the existing measures and there would be a gap of around 3.3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents by 2020. If additional measures were taken, there would be a slight surplus to the target of about half a million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is relevant if we are indeed looking at 2020 as a benchmark. If we look at things in terms of European legislation for the whole period, it can be expected that Belgium, formally speaking, will meet its European objectives, even if we are above the targets by 2020. This is because European legislation provides for a number of flexibility mechanisms. One of the flexibility mechanisms means that the surplus in the years in which it is performed better than the annual targets on the linear trajectory may be transferred to the following years. Since Belgium remained below its target path at the beginning of the current period, we have been able to gather quite a few such allowances, probably enough to have respected our European objective over the entire period by 2020. That is why I made the difference clear to you and mentioned 2020 as a benchmark. Nevertheless, in the context of the European Semester, the recommendations of the European Council, based on analyses by the European Commission, have for years identified in very explicit terms the risk that Belgium will not land on the requested 15% by 2020 The same was said last week, in the context of the in-depth review of our seventh national communication by the United Nations. However, that is a very technical exercise. The UN auditors\' team has made the same observation that has been made in the context of the European Semester, and for years, namely that Belgium would not be on the track by 2020. The reduction in emissions that the federal government wants to achieve by 2030 was the subject of the following question, as well as the way in which this reduction should be achieved. Well, in the design of national energy and climate plan, the federal policy vehicle by horizon 2020, no specific emission reduction is granted to the federal government. However, in this draft, the federal government has proposed to commit itself to continuing existing policies. An important element for you to write down is the following. The decisions under the National Energy and Climate Plan also provide for the regions to identify what federal policies they consider appropriate to support the implementation of their own climate and energy policies. The Federal Government has been instructed to analyse and reply to these proposals, questions and the like from the Regions. I can\'t give you that answer yet. The analysis has largely been done, but I cannot tell you at this time when the answer will be ready. However, it could follow that additional federal measures still need to be taken. I think I showed you a small statistic during my presentation, which showed, among other things, that it is, of course, indicative that most of the questions of the regions relate to taxation in the broad sense, VAT, carbon price, energy tax etc. and, secondly, to mobility. Then there was a question as to how this emission reduction should be achieved. I cannot yet give an answer to this, as the reduction in emissions has not yet been decided. But maybe I should leave out the word ""still"" in the previous sentence. I\'ll have to give you the following. The federal government has committed itself to quantifying its own measures in the context of the energy and climate plan in terms of resources by the end of June 2019. For the federal building heritage, the fleet and the vehicles of the federal government institutions and SNCB, this is in terms of results, i.e. in terms of emission reduction. The agreement on the design of the Energy and Climate Plan does not exclude that all federal measures will be formally evaluated in terms of their emission reduction, but the mandate has not been given. With regard to the biennial exercise that has been carried out by our administration for about ten years, i.e. the assessment of the impact of federal policy, I have to tell you that we are currently so understaffed that it will, unfortunately, be delayed. Finally, as regards the questions of the CD&V Group to Minister Marghem to the European Union to argue for a higher reduction target for 2030, as expressed in the resolution on the repositioning of Belgium in the international climate debate, I would refer you once again to the very explicit call in the context of the Benelux Talanoa Declaration to the European Commission to analyse options, and the call to all parties to the Paris Agreement in the context of the Brussels Declaration ""The Ocean and Climate Change."" I now come to the questions that were addressed directly to me. Will Belgium as a whole meet the climate target for 2020? I have just answered that question. It was also asked whether the European Union would strengthen its 2030 reduction target, as requested by a number of Member States and as indirectly suggested by the Benelux countries and in the Brussels Declaration ""The Ocean and Climate Change."" In a recent resolution, the European Parliament also called on the European Union to raise the current emission reduction target of 40% by 2030, which is consistent with an 80% reduction in emissions by 2050 to 55%. Moreover, the Commission has repeatedly stated in the past that increasing the European renewable energy and energy efficiency targets from 27% to 32% and 32.5% respectively de facto leads to an increase in emission reductions in the European Union of around 45%. There would be a de facto scaling-up of European emission reductions from 40% to 45%. Then there are the pathways in the European Commission\'s proposal of November last year for a long-term strategy. The routes leading to climate neutrality in 2050 also include between 45% and 46% of emissions reduction in 2030 compared to 1990. This is therefore in the same order of magnitude as the emission reduction that is de facto expected by strengthening the renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. However, it should be noted that the speed at which emissions are reduced according to these pathways is higher after 2030 than before. If one assumes a linear trajectory between any year before 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050, then there should be more reduction than that 45%. If that 45% or 46% were to become the Union target for 2030, it would mean an acceleration of annual emission reductions after that year in order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. That was therefore the introduction to the answer to the question of whether there are any indications that the Union will strengthen its reduction targets. What we hear informally is that the European Commission has no intention of putting forward any proposals on the subject in this legislature. This legislature is not going to last much longer either. The result of raising the European NDC to another figure would, of course, be a whole package of legislation, ETS, non-ETS, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It is therefore a very large part of the package that has been drawn up in previous years. Anyway, there are no concrete indications that the European Commission will propose a new NDC. This is a major challenge for the new European Commission after the European elections, especially in view of the role that the European Union has always given itself as leader in international negotiations. It is expected that the leader of these negotiations will put a new NDC on the table in 2020. Previously, Secretary-General Guterres also expressed the expectation that at his summit in September as many countries, parties, United Nations Member States as possible would announce that they would increase their level of ambition contained in their NDCs. There were questions related to the European Commission\'s comments on the draft national energy and climate plan 2021-2030. We expect the European Commission\'s comments by 30 June this year. I cannot give you much more details about the further timeline, because the competent bodies have not yet taken a decision on this matter. The draft National Energy and Climate Plan was established by a joint Steering Committee on Energy Consultations between the State and the Regions, on the one hand, and the National Climate Commission, on the other. The precise timing of the further process and the way in which the recommendations of the European Commission, of the Chamber, of the Advisory Councils and of our neighbouring countries, which we ask for their opinion in the context of the pentalateral forum, as required by the Energy Union Regulation, are not yet known to us, except that the process will have to end with approval by the National Climate Committee and ENOVER by 25 December at the latest, and finally also by the Consultation Committee. One of the key elements in this further process is the public consultation. I was asked how it is organized. There too, I fear that the process is not transparent to the extent that I can fully inform you about it. There, a working group has been set up again in the context of the joint steering committee of the National Climate Commission and ENOVER. Initially, this working group consisted of specialists from the administrations. The working group met on 31 January, but it was then decided to remove the further process from the hands of officials and to put its further examination, the preparation of questions for the public consultation, in the hands of an inter-kabinets working group. Officials will be involved once the questions, the accompanying texts and the summaries have been approved by the Interkabinets Working Group. They can still be submitted to the steering group\'s working group for technical examination. The next question concerns the introduction of a carbon price, which I have just mentioned. For the introduction of a carbon price, the administration has developed three possible scenarios in its research. I was asked to clarify this. I will not just talk about the three possible scenarios, three price paths that we have discussed with stakeholders and other regional and federal departments that have taken part in the national debate; I will also briefly remind you of the main thrust of that discussion. The price trajectories have been viewed and calculated, but of course they are not the only relevant parameters of a possible carbon price. So let me remind you of the three general principles that formed the basis for the debate, namely budget neutrality, the long-term perspective and embedding in a wide range of measures aimed at a transition towards a low carbon future. There are four key elements which define the modalities for the introduction of a carbon price: firstly, the scope or sectors; secondly, the price level and the price path; thirdly, the use of the revenue of a possible carbon price and, fourthly, the alignment of the carbon price with the whole of the policy. We have kept these three routes in mind. They start over the period 2020-2030. Each route will start in 2020 at 10 euros per tonne of CO2 equivalents, to evolve to 40 euros, 70 euros and 100 euros per tonne of CO2 equivalents by 2030. The numbers aren\'t randomly chosen. The EUR 40 per tonne as the final destination of the first possible route corresponds to what the European Commission expects as a carbon price in the European Emissions Trading System. The national debate concerned only the non-ETS sectors. So the 40 euros per tonne would bring the carbon price in the non-ETS sectors to the same level as the carbon price expected in the current ETS on horizon 2030. The high side of the viewed fork, which is EUR 100 per tonne of CO2 equivalents, was there to see what would happen in Belgium and would be possible if we applied the same order of magnitude as, for example, France or Sweden. The 100 euros per tonne of CO2 equivalents is also recommended by the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices. That is a committee in the context of the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition, an initiative of the World Bank. The committee is chaired by Professor Stiglitz and by Nicholas Stern, both of whom you may know. The EUR 70 per tonne is a kind of intermediate level between the two extreme scenarios. It is important that we have looked not only at a number of basic principles, a number of key elements that will determine the modalities of policy, but also at the concrete options that exist, without prejudging which option should be preferred. One possibility is to adjust excise duties on the basis of the carbon content of the fuels taxed by excise duties, with the possibility of limiting them against a benchmark with neighbouring countries. When you look at the transport sector, the mileage tax, road pricing, is an option to modulate according to carbon emissions. In the industrial sector, there is an opportunity to charge the carbon price to the voluntary energy agreements and the accords to the industry as existing in the Walloon and Flemish regions. I was just talking about a limit to a benchmark with neighbouring countries. Throughout the process, we have also looked at the impact of the benchmark, in other words how, in a certain scenario with the carbon price, the price of energy sources in Belgium would be affected compared to the price in our neighbouring countries. If we look at France, the Netherlands and Germany, fuel oil prices are today 26% lower than the average of the neighbouring countries mentioned. For natural gas, that is 23%. In the transport sector the difference is less pronounced: for professional diesel the price in Belgium is 4% lower; for ordinary diesel it is the other way around, because it is 7 % more expensive in Belgium; for petrol the price is 8 % lower. Given that the social dimension is of course an important factor in the discussions, I think it is important to recall the impact of a carbon price on the annual energy bill, given that the possible negative redistributing effect of a carbon price is of course an important factor in the discussions. For heating homes in the price level B, the trajectory going to 70 euros per tonne, and considered in the context of a broader policy of decarbonising our society, the energy bill would fall from 1 418 euros in 2020, with 32 euros carbon price, to 1 270 euros, with 127 euros carbon components, by 2030, or a 10% decrease in energy bill in ten years. Passenger transport We are looking at the annual average energy bill per vehicle..... would decrease from €1731 in 2020 to €1 360 in 2030, or a decrease of 21 %. This in itself does not say much about the possible redistributing effect; it does say something about the size of what causes the carbon price in terms of costs for families to move around by car or to heat their homes. How can carbon price yields be viewed? In this context, we have examined the possibility of meeting the negative redistributing effect, which is a particular risk in the building sector. I take the Swiss model as an example. In Switzerland, all households are reimbursed a lump sum, a fixed, equal amount, from the proceeds of the carbon price they pay. That amount is of that order that there is a net profit for the lower income figures. They get more in return than they pay at carbon price. This has to do with the fact that they use less energy in absolute terms than the higher income levels. Higher income actors therefore pay more and get less back. In this sense, there is a positive redistributing effect. There are, of course, other ways of achieving this. For example, the proceeds can be used to finance investments aimed at the transition in public transport, for example. I\'m also thinking about car ownership. Better accessibility through public transport has a positive redistributing effect. In the context of potential carbon price yields, I will also give you a number of figures. In the intermediate scenario, with a price path B, going to €70 per tonne in 2030, the carbon price would yield €2.6 billion in 2030, not accumulated over a period of time, but in 2030, and start with a yield of €600 million in 2020. If we increase the price, as in section C, by EUR 100 per tonne in 2030, the yield would be EUR 3.7 billion by 2030. These amounts can be said to be significant, I believe. They make the possibilities for recycling revenue interesting, for example to compensate for the social impact. There are also other possibilities for the recycling of revenue. Of course, these possibilities do not have to be mutually exclusive. One possibility that we looked at is a tax shift, whereby the labour costs are reduced, using those revenues. Another option is a shift to electricity, i.e. less electricity charges and more fossil fuel charges through the carbon price, because electrification is one of the levers for the transition to a low carbon future in the longer term. But as I said earlier, these are flat-rate transfers to certain groups of the population, or targeted transfers to the weaker groups and to certain sectors. Funding funds aimed at supporting renovation programmes or specific funds to support SMEs, technological innovation funds, etc. are also possible. Investment in infrastructure, too, I was just talking about public transport, which was referred to as opportunities. In short, there is a wide range of possible destinations for the returns. As I said, the concept of budget neutrality is important. In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I make it clear that it must be a closed whole, in the sense that carbon price yields are used within the same context, albeit socially, albeit with a view to stimulating transition. Finally, policy alignment, embedding in a wide range of measures, aligning the carbon price with the other policies, is important. The carbon price is not a silver bullet, but one of the elements that can guide and steer investment and behaviour in a particular direction, and it is, of course, necessary that the wider policy also goes in the same direction. In the light of policy alignment, a number of specific policy areas should be considered, including the renovation strategies in the building sector, which are mainly owned by the Regions, the policy to improve air quality and specific fiscal measures, such as a number of exemptions or reduced rates for some fossil fuels. Furthermore, in the building sector, for example, it is necessary to examine whether the cadastral income and/or the property levy can be made coherent. VAT schemes, the mileage tax, road pricing and, of course, the system of company or salary cars and other elements of transport tax should also be examined. This was a very brief summary of the very intensive study and consultation work carried out in the context of the national carbon price debate. All documentation, including the figures I have given, is available via the website www.climate.be/2050 under the heading carbon tarification. Then I come to the last series of questions to the Minister and myself, from the PS Group. The PS group had asked the Minister what penalties would be imposed for failure to meet the 2020 targets for reducing greenhouse gases and renewable energy. The penalties provided for are the same as those generally provided for in non-compliance with obligations in the context of European legislation. This is a notice of formal notice, possibly followed by a conviction by the Court of Justice to pay a fine, a periodic penalty payment. The same logic and governance system apply to greenhouse gas and renewable energy targets. So here we are for 2020. By 2030, the situation is a little different, I suppose, not for greenhouse gas emissions, because Belgium has a binding target, as is the case by 2020. On the other hand, there are no targets imposed by European legislation directly for renewables. I don\'t know how to answer you in the affirmative. In the context of the National Energy-Climate Plan, Belgium has an obligation, through the regulation on the governance of the Energy Union, to propose an objective for itself. But I do not know to what extent the Court of Justice would judge in the same way on a bottom-up objective as on an objective contained in a European directive. The question was indeed about the targets set for 2020. I was asked three questions. I\'m asking you for a moment because I\'m getting a little lost in my painting. The first asked what were the causes of the increase in greenhouse gas emissions observed since 2015 in Belgium and whether emissions from European member countries had also increased or decreased since 2015. For the first part concerning the increase in greenhouse gas emissions observed in Belgium, there has indeed been an increase in emissions, but the overall trend remains a reduction. In particular, the increase observed in 2015 over 2014, this increase is relative in the sense that emissions in 2014 were particularly low, as 2014 was a relatively hot year and in which emissions from the building sector, heating emissions from buildings were particularly low. This is therefore not a trend but rather the results of inter-annual variability. The second part of this question is the comments on emissions in the other EU member countries. Generally, at the European level as a whole, emissions have tended to stagnate since 2014. There has been no increase, but stagnation since 2014. Another important element to note is that, nevertheless, the collective programmes of the Member States remain well below the collective ambition. If we look at all the linear trajectories in the context of the sharing decision effort, we move towards an overachievement. That said, it is still important to note that, although the 28 EU Member States as a whole will meet the collective ceiling imposed on them by legislation in the non-ETS sector, there are a number of countries that have exceeded the trajectory in 2016. These include Malta, which has been in this case for years, but more recently also Finland, Poland, Ireland, Germany and Belgium. The last compliance cycle is in 2016. The 2017 compliance cycle has yet to begin. It is not yet known whether this trend will continue. I think it is important for you to note, and I refer to a slide that I presented at the previous session of this committee, that Belgium\'s 2016 broadcasts have been reviewed in the meantime. It\'s a perfectly normal procedure. Emissions are corrected retroactively. This correction has yet to be validated by the European Commission. This correction would not put Belgium in breach. Formally, Belgium remains in breach as the pre-correction figures are used in the compliance cycle. It is important to inform you that Belgium will not automatically be, with this correction of emissions in the 2016 inventory, above the annual ceiling foreseen by the Effort Sharing Decision in 2017. I turn to the penultimate question in my list, where reference is made to a number of Member States requesting an increase of at least 40% in the European target, etc. I would like to inform you that, in the context of ambition in 2050 and in the context of the debate on the European long-term strategy, nine Member States have expressed their support for carbon neutrality. This carbon neutrality can also influence the level of ambition in 2030 if it becomes the European target. These are the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Spain, Italy and Latvia. To our knowledge, Portugal has not yet made a formal statement in the Council of the European Union, but has expressed, in other contexts, the desire to increase the level of European ambition from 80 to 95 % by 2030 – which is more or less carbon neutrality – so as to have an impact on 40%. You know that, because – if I am not mistaken – you refer to it in one of your resolutions. I am thinking of the countries that were called the Paris Proof Coalition, which launched an appeal about a year ago: France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Spain and Luxembourg. It is also important to note that several EU Member States have not only requested that the level of long-term ambition be raised at European level. The Benelux and the coalition around the Brussels Declaration on Oceans and Climate have been very explicit in this regard. This is the case in the Netherlands, through the Rutte III government agreement, which advocates a European target of 55%. This state is not just calling on the European Union to raise the level of ambition, as it has set itself, at national level, the goal of reducing greenhouse gas ambitions by 49% by 2030. For their part, Sweden and Finland set a carbon-neutral target for 2045, while Portugal set the same target for 2050. In addition, national sectoral targets have been developed in terms of decarbonisation. I won\'t give you all the details here. If you wish, I can do it then. Other countries have ambitions that go beyond what is required by European legislation. These include the United Kingdom, which to date is still part of the European Union and France. The final question is whether the Climate Change Department of the FPS Public Health has read the proposed climate law and whether it has any comments to make. I can inform you that we are following your work very closely and with great interest. In this context, I do not think it would be appropriate or useful to go into the details with regard to the proposal for a special law itself. However, I would like to remind you that the proposal made initially by academics is an unexpected consequence of the cycle of academic seminars on climate governance in Belgium organised, during 2018, by our SPF and more particularly by our service. All the results of this academic work, which was largely conducted by a scientific committee with many guests belonging to academic institutions (Belgian universities and other Belgian policy stakeholders and administrations), are available on the climate.be website. If you are doing research on climate governance, you will have access not only to the synthesis report, but also to the reports of the four academic seminars, which to a large extent constitute an analytical basis that motivated the academic authors to draft their draft legislation. In short, during this cycle of seminars, we found that climate policy, in the reality of this country, with the kind of federalism that Belgium is experiencing, is something particularly complicated. We are talking about the broad range of competences, the transversal nature, but also about the fragmentation of climate competences. The other side of this coin is the need for greater coherence and coordinated action, and certainly the need to formulate a clear vision. That\'s also compared to other federal systems. I read here a comparison with the United States, where the federal system, because a lot of powers are in the hands of the states, has just an upward effect in terms of climate policy. Unfortunately, according to the report in Belgium, this upward follow-up effect has not been demonstrated. There is talk of too rigid division of powers, based on principles of exclusivity and autonomy and not on principles such as the principle of mutuality, which is called a positive approach to the principle of federal loyalty. Cooperation as it has so far been in Belgium is also discussed. As you know, it is very largely based on cooperation agreements. I have just referred a few times to the National Climate Commission, which unfortunately too often fails to make timely decisions. If you look at the analysis we made in 2013, you will see that it simply ignores a number of commitments to the parliaments, particularly in terms of transparency. These reports confirm that the 2002 cooperation agreement set up by the National Climate Commission is not being properly implemented. There is also reference to other exercises that have been made in recent years. Opinions of the regional and federal advisory bodies and the Senate\'s information report are recalled here. There are also references to the problematic climate governance in Belgium in various resolutions adopted by this Chamber. The report on climate governance puts an important focus on the driving force, federalism. For example, in the United States, there is now a driving force for a climate policy that is more coherent with the necessary ambition set out by science. In the report, the authors argue that such a driving force is absent in Belgium. The interparliamentary consultation, as you first organised on an ad hoc basis last year, is also referred to as such a driving force. Furthermore, the objectification of climate policy is also mentioned as a driving force, also a message that I have often read in your resolutions in recent years. For example, a scientific basis for policy was advocated. The issue of whether or not this can be objectiveised by addressing the climate in the Constitution has also been a subject of discussion. Of course, the obligations and requirements imposed by the European Union also apply. The vigilance of citizens at the moment is also referred to as a driving force, which raises the question of how this can be organised. A climate law, as argued, can be a driving force, as in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In short, I gave the conclusions of the debate in the Scientific Committee. Not every presentation went in the same direction, but the analysis made is broadly shared by all participants. The authors came to a number of forward-looking conclusions based on the four academic seminars and the conference we organised on 27 November, in the presence of a number of members. It was concluded that an adjustment is necessary, with the need to make progress in the area of cohesion, a shared vision, operationalising ambition, objectifying decisions and, not insignificantly, transparency. It follows from this that a climate law can be an attractive idea, but only with respect for the federal structure of Belgium, which includes a number of things that we have seen in the subsequent proposal for a special climate law of a number of academics. In particular, I would like to say once again that there is a more important role for the parliaments than it seems to be in practice, but you know better than I do how this suggestion is reflected in the proposal for a special climate law. The same applies to the participation of citizens and other civil society actors in the social debate that should underpin the long-term transition. I hope I have answered the questions for a great deal. If not, I am, of course, open to answer further questions for clarification.']","<|system|>

When we talk about the proposed laws, it is really necessary to implement it in order to meet all the necessary conditions and to implement the necessary legal solutions with as little interference as possible in the already existing system. One of the most important conditions when we talk about these bill proposals is the creation of a single and centralised system in which the data relating to both jobs, in public and state administration, will be contained and data relating to the pay elements of employees, as well as other costs will be contained. This unique centralised system is planned to be established in phases, between 2020 and 2024, but what is much more important is to provide for costs for the Republic of Serbia\'s budget relating to the allocation of salaries for public or state sector employees. But unlike the period before 2012, when the Republic of Serbia could boast of winning medals in certain individual and team sports, we changed the Republic of Serbia completely for this period of almost ten years. By 2012, we could boast that we are second in Europe, but in the background, when we talk about GDP, and today we can praise that we are the country that is first in Europe towards cumulative economic growth for 2020 and 2021, and that growth for this year, and that is exactly one of the most important things when we talk about wages and pensions, will be 7.5% and that is what we expect, but we will certainly continue in the next year according to the projections of the budget that we adopted here in the National Assembly for 2022. But all of this would not have been if in 2012, we hadn\'t thought rationally about how to make our economic system sustainable and how to provide citizens with higher salaries and pensions. What we never have to hide and what we can be proud of is that during the 2020 Coronal pandemic, we acted rationally and responsibly. In 2020, the state managed to identify all the negative effects that would bring the pandemic of the coronary virus both in the area of the economy and when we talk about the citizens of the Republic of Serbia and then the state came very rationally. She said that these negative effects of the pandemic of the coronary virus must be taken over in part and thus helped through three packages to help the total of eight billion euros, but what specifically set us apart from the countries in the region was a one-time cash aid of 100 euros to our full-time citizens. Although we were very rational in 2020, we decided that instead of certain structural reforms that should have started then, we were building a new hospital cove. We\'ve built a whole new three hoofs of hospitals in less than four months. We have decided that the functionality of our health system is at the highest level and that healthcare system has worked better in many segments than health systems across Europe. We decided to get the most expensive drugs, we decided to get respirators and other medical supplies, with only one goal, which is to keep our citizens safe and safe. But in addition to all these costs that we had in addition to all these investments, and I will remind you, too, that by 2012 we had only half the clinical center, and that today we have a new Clinical Center in Nis, that we are bringing to an end the reconstruction of the Clinical Centre of Serbia and that we are reconstructing the Clinical Centre of Vojvodina. But despite all these things, structural, which we have managed to make the Republic of Serbia more modern and powerful, we have found space and in these most difficult times to spare the necessary funds to raise wages and pensions. These increases were also in 2021, and to the satisfaction of all citizens of the Republic of Serbia, it will continue in 2022. We\'ll raise public sector wages by 7% and 8%, respectively. We\'ve increased the minimum profit. We have reduced the untaxable share of profits, but we will also increase pensions by 5.5% to our oldest citizens, who have managed to carry out the burden of fiscal consolidation, which began in 2012, so that our economic system will strengthen and that we can today praise that we have a 7.5% growth. But by 2012, we had people at the head of the state who were exclusively concerned about their interests, and after 2012, we have those people who care exclusively about the interests of the Republic of Serbia at the head of the country. What is a big difference when we look at certain countries in our environment, but also in Europe, is that someone is obviously not responding strong, not responding strong, stable, independent Serbia, Serbia that makes its own decisions. And it is this desire that Serbia must form governments in foreign embassies, that others draw up governments for them in certain restaurants and cafes throughout Belgrade, has also led to these waves of protests that have been happening in Serbia for the past two weeks. The leaders of these protests, which I have spoken in several previous sessions, are the so-called representatives of environmental parties, and I do not say for free the so-called representatives of environmental parties, because they appeared almost two years ago and who said they exclusively represented the Green Agenda, the protection of the environment, the healthier country, the water, the air, and in fact they represented branches of political parties and not of any political parties, but of those political parties who advocated coming to power without choice, without the will of citizens, and perhaps with the help of certain foreign factors to put them into power. When we talk about these green movements, it is not hidden, the leaders of these parties are also Dobrica Veselinović, the most famous volunteer on the Balkan territory. There is also Sava Manojlovic and his movement ""Kreni - Change"", which received assistance from a 25,000-euro NGO from Rockefeller in June 2021. I fully agree with those thesis, which is what President Aleksandar Vukic said several times, that it is obvious that in these protests these green movements want to take over political leadership over Dragan Djilas, Marinika Tepic, but what is important, don\'t do it on the streets and don\'t do it over the coat of arms of the people. What we could see in the past two weeks is a harsh violation of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and the law. The restriction of freedom of movement can only be implemented in accordance with the Constitution and the law and in certain specific situations, but individuals cannot do so, nor can certain movements and certain political parties do so. It is obvious that there is a desire for certain political officials to take over certain competences from the Constitution and the law and that they are blocking someone\'s freedom of movement. And it happened throughout the Republic of Serbia, but it also happened on the highway, on an international road. And who needs it? I\'m really asking today -- who needs to make cheap political points to block the highway, block the traffic, to bring out certain political pamphlets and certain political messages? They tell you that their only problem here is that we MPs have passed the Expropriation Act without them reading it, that their problem is the referendum law, and the Venice Commission has told us that the law is good. To them the problem is ""Rio Tinto"", but they won\'t tell you that Rio Tinto came to Serbia in 2004. And as my colleague Djordje Dabic said in today\'s presentation, a series of documents were signed from 2004 to 2012. The only consensus existed between the state of the Republic of Serbia and Rio Tinta was one memorandum from 2012, but where in the second position of the memorandum it was said there were no mutual obligations between the two parties. We are told by people whose Minister Oliver Dulic led the Ministry of Ecology and who cleaned up the budget of the Republic of Serbia instead of cleaning up dumps. They tell us today that we are not in favour of the environment, and the Ministry of Environment has done it for a period of over a year more than the last 10 years. Prime Minister Brnabic here, reading the exposés, said one of the top three priorities is environmental protection. We\'re doing it today. We\'ve planted, or the Ministry of RES planted over 150,000 seedlings. We\'re doing new wastewater purifiers. We\'re doing everything we need to do in accordance with the Green Agenda. But evidence that we are working very responsibly and that we are working for the interests of the citizens of the Republic of Serbia shows today\'s news that EU countries have agreed to open the Cluster 4, which concerns the Green Agenda and sustainable development. The decision will be taken after the Intergovernmental Conference, which will take place in Brussels on 14 December. These clusters will open negotiating chapters on transport policy, energy, trans-European network, environment and climate change. But you won\'t hear it on the media like N1, Nova S, directly. You will not hear, because this would open the topic – what did you do until 2012 when we talk about protecting the environment? Then you see the protests, you attend to watch from home protests, where people close the highway and the traffic, people take their children out of the car to cross the Pančeva Bridge, and then during those protests, you will have Dragan Djilas, Marinika Tepic and Dejan Bulatovic, who openly threatened that everyone will chase their promoter after the fall of power. Why, when we talk about any legal proposal, what lies do you make? That\'s why President Aleksandar Vukic, unlike all the former presidents, went to the Loznica and despite all the blockades, took a car to talk to his people. But when we watched that transmission, we didn\'t really see that the citizens of Loznica, or the Upper Weeks, were so worried. People have certain legitimate concerns. But you know why they\'re worried? Because they constantly read about how Rio Tinto is the biggest problem every day. But the same Dragan Djillsa, Marinika Tepic and Dejan Bulatovic will not tell you that during the rule of DS ""Rio Tinto"" has entered Serbia. What I also want to say is that today President Aleksandar Vukic visited the ""Belgrade on Water"" site and said it was one of the biggest projects. When we leave, we can see what\'s been done in the space of the former Sava amphitheater. But that\'s what they rebelled against, and that\'s what they said, and they said that out of ""Beograda on water"" will be just a model, and we\'ve built several buildings today, the biggest park in this part of Europe, the largest building in this part of Europe will be. We are doing everything to improve Serbia, to make Serbia more modern and developed. What I must also say is to ask the question – why are there pressures on the streets? Pressure is done exclusively on the streets because they don\'t have a political programme, because they have no political idea. Today their conference has the same Sava Manojlovic. You know what he resented about the referendum law? He resented that if you submit in the future to the People\'s Initiative, you must single out 11,000 euros to verify these signatures at the notaries. That didn\'t bother Savi Manojlovic when he put up with the folk initiatives here at the National Assembly for Realitative Programs, and what is disputed to verify? What\'s the matter with you and your signatures? This provides a higher level of legal certainty for all citizens of the Republic of Serbia because if you want to submit a national initiative, you go to the notaries, the notary finds that you have approached, that your personal data is no problem. The second problem is because unless the referendum succeeds, it is delayed by a year. That\'s what you say. You\'re saying that you haven\'t opened a single negotiating chapter, you\'re talking about which of your majority here in the National Assembly led to a policy being represented towards the EU, you haven\'t opened a single negotiating chapter, and then we ask the question – what is the ultimate goal? The final goal is to slow Serbia down, bring down Alexander Vukic, but bring him down without a choice. What makes us different is the very gathering in Arena, and when President Aleksandar Vucic said that SNS policy is to unite Serbia, to unite the citizens of the Republic of Serbia because at this point we are small and we do not have the luxury of creating internal conflicts. These 10 programme principles are very important for Serbia\'s progress, which is Serbia\'s independence, Serbia\'s demographic recovery, the zero rate towards organised crime and corruption, and what is most important is the development of political dialogue in society. We want to talk, and whenever we talked, we showed a high degree of construction. There is no such openness and constructiveity by them. I\'ll just take one more minute so my colleagues can take part in the debate. When you talk about the green goals you want to achieve through these protests, it is a lie of the citizens of the Republic of Serbia because you have, after the protest, during yesterday\'s day of Mr Zelenovic, who shared the citizens of Sapca in the first and second order. He went ahead of the presidency and made political demands, which is to pass a law in the Assembly banning Rio Tinto and others to change, namely to resolve all REM members. There\'s this key link right there. These same requirements were submitted by those in the first inter-party dialogue to replace all REM members. This is important to them in order for them to set up their own people and continue with everything they\'ve done since 2012 when they created the multicoma empire. I ask the citizens of the Republic of Serbia that, since they announced protests for the coming week, they remain abstentions and, as President Aleksandar Vukic said, we must not allow terror of minorities above most, that we must remain abstention and remain calm, that the authorities are doing their jobs. I, as well as my parliamentary group, will support these laws in the voting day because these laws are just giving a momentum to a better, stronger and more modern Serbia. Thank you.', 'Successively, by the end of those development projects by the end of 2020, Serbia\'s first phase of domestic development equipment will be implemented, which will allow for the rise of its operational capacity for, believe it or not, about 60%. Military equipment with new weapons and military equipment systems, such as communication and command-information systems and fire management systems, optical, electronic and surveillance systems, tools, artillery, armored combat vehicles, points of increased level, ballistic protection, PSC systems of small range, air surveillance and reporting centres, a new generation of firearms, guided anti-arming missiles, electronic reconnaissance systems and anti-electronic facts and field vehicles will be carried out. The implementation of this policy simultaneously achieves two objectives, and this is an increase in the operational capabilities of the Serbian Army necessary to carry out, but directly, of course, more production in our dedicated industry. Also, I want to praise the results, we have divided 1412 apartments for members of the Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Army. During 2014, works on building facilities at the Bezanjska Kosa site in Belgrade, whose construction began in 1992, will address 160 more residential needs of defence ministry employees and Serbia\'s Vojsca. Through the realization of master plans, it was continued with the sale or exchange of inspective military complexes, so 43 military complexes were sold and exchanged in the previous four years. The total agreed value for the object at 43 complexes is 24m euros. Of that amount, about fourm euros were directly charged, while about 13.8m euros were realised by taking over 141 apartments from local self-government and Serbia\'s Building Directorate. The rest will be realised in the next five-year plan. With regard to the efficient and transparent use of budget funds, particularly with regard to the reduction of the risk of corruption, the Ministry of Defence received recognition from relevant international entities and the results of Transparency International Anti-corruption Index, which refers to the level of corruption in defence systems published in early 2016, Serbia is located in a group of countries with moderate risk of corruption. Progress has been made in more than 45% of the indicators compared to the 2012 results, when they were in a group of countries at high risk of corruption. According to this study, our defense system is among the 34 best-ranked defense systems in the world. I don\'t mind when your phones ring, even though it\'s pretty rude. I don\'t mind, but I have to tell you it\'s better to be told by Belgrade and Serbia, not by Moscow and Washington and Brussels, because you are in the National Assembly of Serbia and take care of it. The issue of Kosovo and Metohija remains undoubtedly a major challenge in the new government\'s mandate. We will not recognise the unilaterally declared independence of our southern province, but in the interest of regional stability and better Serbian-Albanian relations, we will continue the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. In this process we will participate in a responsible and transparent way, and all agreements will be made available to the public as before. The dialogue, its intensification, solutions that are not always satisfied with Belgrade or Pristina, is the only possible way of progress, not only for people in Kosovo and Metohija, but for this dialogue to a significant extent, which all people in Serbia need to know, defines the possibility of political and economic prosperity of our entire nation. Unlike many on our political scene, I am opposed to the dangerous concept of freezing conflicts, but also irresponsible ideas that Serbia should be resolved by concessions that would endanger the survival of our people in the province. the political ballast of Kosovo and Metohija. In dialogue with Pristina, I will continue to participate personally. I\'ll be there when it\'s the hardest and I won\'t hide behind other people\'s signatures. Leading a responsible policy, we will do everything possible to protect our people\'s interests, as well as our vital state and national interests in Kosovo and Metohija. Serbia will, above all, continue to insist on starting negotiations as property and preserving Serbia\'s cultural and spiritual heritage in Kosovo and Metohija, as well as establishing a community of Serb municipalities because, for those who do not know, and when they criticised the Brussels Agreement, they did not tell the people that 40%, or six out of 15 points of the Brussels Agreement, were just talking about establishing a community of Serb municipalities, which would have the capacity to have a crucial impact on the better and safer lives of the Serb people in the area. Serbia will continue to be institutionally present in Kosovo and Metohija through its education and health system, through cultural institutions, as well as through the operation of local self-government. I don\'t have to, I don\'t think I can explain to anyone in this House what we inherited after the Kumanov Agreement, and in what situation we have to worry about helping our people as much as possible. The Serb people in Kosovo and Metohija and then, of course, the aggression against our country, the Serb people in Kosovo and Metohija in the coming period should be further institutionally strengthened by the opening of a Serb community, whose establishment of Pristina has long, long been obstructing. I won\'t say anything in parliament against Albanian authorities because I\'m different from them and because we don\'t need to score political points by criticising others, but someone has to bear in mind that they\'re attacking us, that we haven\'t partially reached agreements signed in August of last year, and we\'re talking about vital, key, basic, first agreement reached in April and a half before the last agreement, and we haven\'t moved, but dead letters on paper still exist. But the talks will continue, we understand even their internal political relations, but that doesn\'t mean we won\'t take care of our people\'s interests. Our goals in Kosovo and Metohija will be to preserve political stability, continued monitoring of political processes and implementation of established state policies, and to carry out affairs in areas of support for local self-government, economy, economic development, infrastructure projects, return and survival, justice, human rights, property and legal issues, international co-operation and co-operation with international missions in the territory of the province, culture, protection of cultural heritage and assistance to the Serbian Orthodox Church, which I would say is one of the key institutions that helps preserve and survive our people in Kosovo and Metohija, support for public services and social assistance. Sustainable economic development will be more than ever in the focus of our policy in Kosovo and Metohija. What we can praise in Kosovo and Metohija is not the result of the government, this is the result of the struggle for the survival of our people, but that is why we need a greater and stronger presence of our public services in order to provide them with a better life, which is that we have the highest natural growth, i.e. the highest birth rate on the territory of the Republic of Serbia in Kosovo and Metohija, in the Serbian environments in Kosovo and Metohija, especially in Kosovo Pomoravlje, so that is a triple, three-and-a-half times the birth rate of the average birth rate in the territory of the Republic of Serbia in general. Also, protecting the property of the Republic of Serbia in Kosovo and Metohija, the property of our business entities and the Serbian church will remain at the top of the Serbian government\'s priorities. We fought all the time, and we will also fight for the Trepce, the Gazivod, for the infrastructure in Brezovica, although you know how we faced illegal privatisations and acquisitions by temporary institutions in Pristina. What\'s this all about, so everyone can understand? They were running all the time, but absolutely all the time they were running away from talking in any way about whose property it is, what it is that it is the property of the Republic of Serbia, what it is is that it is someone\'s other property. Not for a second did they want to agree to talk about it because they brought dozens of so-called. parallel laws that would try to transfer that property to themselves, which is not only property of Kosovo, Serbian or Albanian, it is property and state of Serbia, but it is property and other citizens who invested it. And we have therefore insisted and will continue to insist in talks and negotiations under the auspices of the European Union that the property issue be raised, because the issue of property is one of the essential issues. If we resolve this issue, we have solved a lot and many problems in the future will be easier to solve with Albanians. Several capital infrastructure projects have been launched, such as the regional water pipeline Zubin Potok-Kosovo Mitrovica-Zvecan, the construction of the Banjska complex, which will end in the term of the government. This will give us the incentive to develop tourism, with the desire that the greater number of citizens of Serbia, Serbs from the region, visit that part of our country, visit Kosovo and Metohija so directly strengthen ties with our national source. In the area of agriculture, we have also made significant steps towards creating a system that will allow one number of our country\'s country\'s compatriots to live on agriculture, regardless of whether the country is being processed in Gorazdevec, Strpc, Stanishor, Novi Brdo or Leposavic. We\'ve divided a large number of agricultural machines, seedlings, repromaterials, and soon we\'ll have stable channels for the placement of agricultural products under more favourable conditions. When it comes to the return of internally displaced, there are the weakest results, the level of statistical error. We have also prepared a new concept of socially and economically sustainable return settlements and, as you have seen, this has caused major political problems in Kosovo and Metohija itself. It\'s ""Sun Valley"". Albania\'s authorities are going into a tough fight with something that should bring life and that means life and we don\'t know what anyone can have against people\'s lives. There are no military facilities, no police facilities, there are building residential buildings, there are building business facilities, there are building pools, places where people should live and enjoy and nothing more, to be on their own. Dear People\'s MPs and citizens of Serbia, the government will continue to co-operate in Kosovo and Metohija with representatives of the international community, Unmik, Eulex and KFOR above all to protect rights and create a safe environment for the Serbian people in the province. Without intending to violate the secular structure of our political system, we will step up co-operation with the Serbian Orthodox Church, as a key, not only religious, but also the national institution in Kosovo and Metohija, together fighting for the interests of our people, and against attempts to forge history by Albanianising Serbian historical, religious and cultural heritage. You have seen both the latest cases and the publication in textbooks in both Albania and Kosovo and Metohija that the Decans built Gashi, that our monasteries did not build either Milutin or anyone else from the German dynasty, but that belonged to certain Albanian dynastys. We won\'t deal with it. That is exactly how we fought and bravely opposed, despite the many pressures that came from the international community, to protect our religious sacral objects in UNESCO. I\'m not saying that\'s the victory we\'ve won for many years, but what\'s our job is to fight. We\'ll fight in the future. What I can say is that so far they have failed to defeat us, and that victory would also mean the humiliation of one culture, the culture of a people, the humiliation of civilization, I would say, the demeaning and humiliation of the Serbian people. We will continue to work and organise new cultural events, support institutions, cultural and artistic societies, safeguarding the folklore tradition of our people, continue to work on strengthening the health and education system in Kosovo and Metohija. When I talk about it, I\'m not just talking about four northern Kosovo municipalities, so I\'m talking about Leposavić, Zubin Potok, Zvecan and Kosovo Mitrovica, but also about Kosovo Pomoravlje, Strpc, so I\'m talking about Ranilug and Šilov and Partesh and Pasjan and Donjo Budriga, Novi Brdo, all the places we invested in, from hospitals to churches, and we\'re not ashamed of it, but we\'re proud of it. We\'ve invested in schools, we\'re going to invest even more, as well as in health facilities, so I think at least as far as people are concerned, people will be able to feel safer, safer, and that they can also plan generations that come to their survival on the eternal hearths. As so far, in Kosovo and Metohija, we will continue to provide the necessary social assistance. I want to inform you - the right to this kind of assistance has been achieved by 540 families with 1,512 members, and on behalf of the families of kidnapped and missing persons and single money aids, the right has been achieved by 870 families. In Kosovo and Metohija, 7,536 families live in a constant state of need for humanitarian aid and their existence depends on the support provided by the Government of the Republic of Serbia. The Office for Kosovo and Metohija continuously provides and distributes 8,000 family packages of food and 8,000 family hygiene packages for socially endangered families. These are just some examples of the functioning of our social policy in the province, with which we will certainly continue. What we cannot continue with, is that someone gets five packages for one family, five salaries for one man, and if, already as the Republic of Serbia, we allow our people in northern Kosovo not to pay for electricity, then we expect in other areas that the Republic of Serbia will not be deceived, it will respect and give more than its residents in Kosovo and Metohija expect. We only expect respect for the money that all other Serbian citizens invest in these republics. The issue of Kosovo and Metohija is much more than the territorial identity issue. It is the point at which Serbia-Albanian relations will be defined in the coming period, depending on stability and the economic perspective of the entire region. Our people and our citizens probably don\'t know that, many don\'t like to hear it, but Serbs and Albanians are the two largest peoples in the Western Balkans and the relationship between Serbs and Albanians depends on the future of the Western Balkans. It has changed, it used to be some other two nations, today Serbs and Albanians are the two largest nations. We need to talk about the future, we need to negotiate, because our relationship, the good relationship between Serbs and Albanians is the backbone of relations in the future, and we will do our best to build such good relations by safeguarding the integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Serbia. What we don\'t want is for unsettled Serbian-Albanian relations to be a latent threat to Serbia\'s stability and progress, and therefore we will always be committed to working on a peaceful resolution of disagreements. I also want to say that we will never forget our diaspora, our people who are scattered into about 160 countries. This is now the part about the diaspora relationship. We have a number of diaspora, a people who have moved for centuries and decades and started a new life in other places. The thing that hurts the most is that over the past decade, the entire generations of the most educated have gone away, and we won\'t be able to stop it even in the next period. From EU countries, you have a percentage greater outflow than that outflow from the Republic of Serbia. From Croatia, which is an EU member, you have a higher percentage outflow and the most educated people than you have from the Republic of Serbia. From Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, too, not only is Romania three times the population of the Republic of Serbia, but there are seven times the number of people leaving, leaving Romania, going to the EU\'s most developed countries. Of course, it\'s easier for them today because of the so-called. working permits, which as a member of the EU, but I am telling you that this is one process of globalisation in which the work of people no longer matters where they live. What we want to point out to our people is that wherever we live, we know that Serbia is perceived as their homeland, and we\'re going to try, there\'s been countless of these attempts, and every one of them has failed, and I\'m already kind of sick and tired of it, but we\'re going to try to turn to them, so we can show them that we\'re not asking them for money, that we\'re not going to be able to take from them and take anything that some others have done before, but that we just want to love their country as they have loved them to date, and if they want and can help them invest the money they made in the world in our Serbia. They and their families and their money are welcome. We\'ll deal with Serbs in the region and try to solve their accumulated problems. They will always be able to count on our support and help with the fact that we will always respect the territorial integrity of our neighbours. Serbia has already signed interstate agreements with countries in the region that regulate the position of Serbian rights. We\'re going to ask that these agreements be respected, because it\'s obvious that in certain countries nothing is respected. It is not allowed for Serbs in the Republic of Croatia, returnees living the lives of normal people, a dignified life, today to have neither electricity nor the possibility of a normal life, and only because they belong to the Serb family, the Serbian people. These problems are piled up, but it seems to me that by investing in creating better relationships, first of all, with these countries we will achieve rather better conditions for these people. What we are going to do in our country, and in a special chapter around national minorities, later on, further to say, is that we treat national minorities always in a good way, to try to make it even better, to make these people feel proud to belong to another family, but proud of being citizens of the Republic of Serbia. I think there are no more important things than that and that someone can say – I am proud to be Hungarian, but also proud to live in Serbia. Happy and proud to be Bosniak and also as happy and proud to be a Serbian citizen. As queen, we will do everything we can to preserve the identity of Serbs in the diaspora by investing in the work of their cultural associations, learning Serbian language and diplomatic struggle for their legal status. We will take care of our people in the world wherever they are, and I am grateful to them endlessly, because in difficult times, and that was up to two, two and a half years ago, when we fought with the danger of bankruptcy, the signs that came from abroad literally kept Serbia, or our nose above water, and that\'s why we somehow could barely survive. We\'re not in this situation today. I\'m not talking about individual cases, as a state we have enough money, we have enough money to single out for other things, and that\'s why we\'re going to allocate significantly more funds in the future and bigger within the new government\'s mandate you\'ll be able to see for the needs of improving our co-operation with Serbs living around the world. Now it seems to me that we\'re moving on to a difficult one, now it\'s hard to assess what\'s important, and what\'s less important, to what\'s the core, I\'d say the government\'s programme and the analysis of what\'s been done and the analysis of what\'s going to be done in the next period. It is about macroeconomic stability, jobs, stronger economic activity. The macroeconomic stability is understood, the precondition for all other reforms, fiscal discipline, prices, the course of the dinar. As pillar one, strong and credible stabilisation of public finances and halting public debt growth by 2017. What did we do? As a result of the programme of fiscal and structural adjustment and recovery of the economy that began to be implemented by the government of the Republic of Serbia in the previous term. Although it has been brought into very difficult macroeconomic conditions, the programme has contributed to reducing the internal and external imbalances that Serbia is exposed to. The global crisis has denied the fact that economic growth, which is not based on sound foundations, poses a serious threat to macroeconomic sustainability. The outbreak of the crisis made it clear that there was a lack of a growth model based solely on consumption and imports. Let me remind you that in the years 2008 to 2012 we had a completely wrong economic policy in which we have just insisted on increasing GDP growth by increasing domestic consumption. That\'s how we invested in certain tycoons, that\'s how we got commissions for that dirty job, that\'s how we took Serbia down, that\'s what brought it literally to the edge of the ambis. Emergency fiscal measures and reform structures were lacking to address the problem not only of long-term recession but also of debt crises and growing indifference in high unemployment conditions. The alarm situation in public finances required urgent fiscal consolidation measures. It has become clear that the existing public spending structure is unsustainable due to the constant increase in the fiscal deficit and the growing level of public debt participation in GDP. Also, the first effective consolidation on the revenue side was not satisfactory. As a result of a sharp and comprehensive increase in the number of tax rates, there was a deterioration in the collection of tax revenues, especially after the increase and the profit tax which also those who made the decision in 2011, if I am not mistaken, they could not believe that they could bring the chain into poor tax collection. In particular, we haven\'t recovered in the tobacco sector until 2015, and we haven\'t been able to recover that part of the market until today, even though it\'s incomparably better than it was two years ago. In 2015, after difficult measures, and I want to thank all Serbian citizens for that, and for the MPs in that mandate and for all the members of the government who had the courage to accept it and for those who will not be members of the government tomorrow, because it will remain written in history that there were people who are ready to accept the most unpopular, most difficult measures, which nobody in Serbia has welcomed, but these measures have led to today we have a healthier economy than many EU countries, although it is understood, with an unmatched lower GDP, but with an unmatched faster growing GDP and with incomparably less imbalances than they have on the fiscal side. In 2015, we managed for the first time to bring about the growth of the legal market, due to an effective fight against the gray economy. Similarly, it happened with the payment of other tax revenues. After poor initial results in charge in the first half of the year, this trend was completely reversed in 2014 and 2015. The programme of economic reforms that started and implemented the stand-by arrangement with the IMF has produced very serious results, and after years of failed attempts to remove essential obstacles to growth and reduce the structural deficit, implementation of the programme has established a permanent removal of fiscal imbalances. The 2015 budget was brought in line with the efforts to provide the basics for healthy economic growth, macroeconomic stability and sustainable fiscal system, despite the skepticism of the entire domestic, partial and expert public, and I am obliged to thank the individual associations that I expected to be politically against us who helped us, and from the Union of Economists of Serbia and to many others, to many independent economists who were on our side, who knew how important it was to move into these reforms and without their professional support, we would not be able to explain to anyone in Serbia that we were doing great, important and good things for our country. The fiscal deficit was halved by 6.6, and it wasn\'t 6.6, it was almost 8, because at that time we had what they say underneath the line hidden the various fiscal imbalances from what we\'d singled out for public enterprises, for Jellyzara, for many other things. We didn\'t even count that in those 6.6% deficits. That was about 8% of the deficit. Last year we ended up with a 3.4% deficit, this year it seems to me that in the general state at this point we are at 0.1 deficit, we do not have a deficit in the general state in the republican budget, in the Serbian government budget, I was already telling you, where we are in surplus of 19.6 billion today. So these are impressive results that allow you to see in the next period how and in what way and to increase wages and see what to do with pensions, that pensioners can live easier, and I am convinced that in the coming months not much, but always this stable increase and improvement will be able to feel. After eight years, for the first time today, economic activity is at 2% above the pre-crisis level, so since 2008, we have been falling and destroying our own substance. That is why I am sure that somewhere in the previous 2014 elections, people have managed to think, and then in 2016, to make an additional commitment not to nonsense and insecure promises, but to opt for work and for what are objective, realistic and fulfilling promises. The cyclical analysis of economic activity indicates that after eight years, economic activity is further accelerated and that after a deep recession that was reduced in 2013 and then re-energized after the catastrophic floods that hit us in 2014. In 2015 we manage to ensure the initial recovery of economic activity. We had growth plus 0.8% of gross domestic product. In a fruit-based fiscal consolidation based on both expenditure reduction and increased tax revenues, reform laws, a better investment climate, remember that we have shifted our country\'s position from 91 to 59 in the during business list. All of this results in a sustained recovery, a more sustained recovery of economic growth and reaching pre-crisis GDP levels in early 2016. Today is the first time we\'ve been able to get past it in two percent after eight years. For eight years, at least two or three years it took us to make up for five and six years of catastrophic economic policymaking in our country. It is good that we have managed to achieve this in such a short time, because as Kim Dehang said - there is no country in the world that has managed so successfully in such a short time to get out of such a deep crisis as Serbia was in. The reduction of external trade imbalances, aided by adapting domestic economy and improving external competitiveness, has continued. A high contribution to foreign direct investment, faster growth in the euro area at the beginning of the year and favourable exchange relations contributed to the strong growth of our exports, so the net external demand was the main driver of the growth of the gross domestic product. The recovery is also achieved in household consumption thanks to the growth of income and employment in the private sector, lower costs of paying off existing loans and recovery of credit activities. The current balance sheet deficit has continued to decrease and, most importantly, it is fully covered by the inflow of foreign direct investment. The successful coordination of monetary and fiscal policy has enabled the relaxation of monetary policy, the gradual reduction of the reference interest rate, while preserving the stability of course and price. The reference interest rate was reduced to the historical minimum of 4%, to remind the 2008 mentioned, the reference interest rate was 17.75% and the average inflation was 11.7%. I think these numbers speak enough. Thanks to the measures taken by economic policy today, we are on the path of accelerated recovery. The EU\'s Economic and Finance Council praised the 2016 economic reform programme, which the government adopted in March of this year and found a much faster economic recovery than expected, which was fuelled by stronger confidence as a result of the economic reforms carried out, as if further intensification and progress of economic activities as a result of investments and exports were expected. It also particularly praised the significant reduction in the budget deficit in the previous year, which opened the space for the relaxation of monetary policy. Positive developments in the real sector that prevailed in most of 2015 were continued in early 2016. Real growth of gross domestic product in the first quarter of 3.5% is significant beyond expected and beyond our expectations. It makes it easier for me to drink water to get some time. (Vojislav Seselj, from the city: Would you like a soda? No, Mr. Seselj, I leave you diapers and juice, I don\'t need anything, not even a chair. A positive contribution to growth has been made by all manufacturing sectors. The increased external demand and high inflow of foreign direct investment in the previous year have positively affected industry growth, while repairing the investment environment and continuing the realisation of infrastructure projects prompted construction growth. In addition, economic activity has increased in a number of service sectors, trade, traffic, hospitality, tourism. In the second quarter, the growth of the economic activity of 1.8% continues, hence, in the period January-June 2016, the growth of the overall economic activity of 2.6% was recorded. I just want to remind you that it was planned at the beginning of the year for this growth to be 1.2%, then the IMF changed the forecast to 1.3, then 1.5, then 1.8, then 2 to 2.5%. That at the same time, countries in the region predicted themselves from 4.2, i.e. 1.8% to 4.2% of growth, at this point none of the countries in the region have a growth greater than 2.1%, which means that in the first six months, although this is not the easiest for us, it is the most difficult for Serbia and Croatia, because these are the two largest economies in the region to achieve such a growth rate. We have the highest growth rate in the region and in Europe at the moment Romania, Poland, do not know a third country that has a higher growth rate than the Republic of Serbia in the first six months. This is something of course not enough, it will have to increase if we want to speed up the standard of citizens to arrive at EU countries and therefore we will also take many other measures in the coming period. The trend of good fiscal results continued in the first quarter, we were already talking about it. To know that the planned deficit of the general state, the planned deficit amounted to 78.3 billion dinars, while the deficit achieved in the first half was only 18.2. After seven months when it\'s planned to be the same level of deficit, we have a surplus, as you\'ve seen from 21 billion, and at this point on today, to repeat 19.6. With conservative assumptions on the income and distribution side, therefore, I\'m always talking about conservative assumptions. I never tell you about better things. Don\'t forget that we here in the National Assembly have accepted the budget in which I have sought, dear friends, and have received your trust and support, that we have a deficit of 122 billion dinars this year. We don\'t have a deficit right now and there won\'t be 122 billion. We\'re going to go to a budget rebalance where we\'re going to watch how to distribute money differently because we don\'t have a negative, we have a plus, and these are already changes in the last two years that are different. In addition to conservative assumptions on the income and distribution side, the general government deficit is predicted to be below 2.5% with local self-governments that cause us the biggest problems, with local self-governments and other non-governmental institutions, and the government of Serbia\'s budget, of course, is significantly below that. And by the way, the plan was for the general government deficit, so with local self-government to be below 4% of the IMF, the World Bank, the IBRD, everyone would say it was a good result, given what we inherited. The result achieved is therefore, in the past seven months only 95 billion dinars better than planned. Such a good result is due to the growth of tax revenues and has a lasting character, not a temporary one. Tax revenues are higher than the plan for 54.7 billion dinars, 11.7% while non-tax revenues are higher by 18.7 billion, 31.3%. Compared to realisation in 2015, all tax forms recorded growth - excise growth of 22.6% compared to 2015, profit tax growth of 20.2 compared to 2015, VAT growth of 12.1 compared to 2015, income tax of 8.6 compared to 2015. You can also see that the number of employees and salaries in the private sector has increased, the rate of growth of 8.1% compared to 2015, although it was expected that customs duties and due to the rules we have adopted with the EU would certainly be reduced. We\'re ready to talk. Now here\'s one news, very important to the citizens of Serbia, especially the poorest, those who have the lowest incomes. We\'re ready to talk to all the partners in the socio-economic council, the new government as soon as it\'s formed, we\'re going to stand up as the government to raise the minimum labour price, it\'s a 121 dinar today. We\'ll also talk to the employers that they\'re not satisfied, but we can do it regardless of what we have and part of the users of the state budget that receives minimum earnings. We have budget savings on the basis of which we can handle it, but we want to make both foreign and domestic investors pay the minimum labour price, because when you raise someone\'s salary to 22.5 thousand dinars or 23 thousand dinars from 21.5 thousand dinars, that\'s for him and how significant. Also, I want to address the pensioners and say, I did not say this in the election campaign, but thanks to what they did, and they submitted the biggest and most difficult sacrifice in the previous period, I want to inform them that in the next four-year term, the Serbian government will be able to expect a better and continuous increase in pensions. I\'m not saying they\'re gonna live ideally, I\'m not saying they\'re gonna get much better, but they\'re gonna get better. They will be better and they will not suffer for their future, and they will always be able to know that pensions are safe, that they are coming right into the day, that not one hour will never be late and that they will always be only bigger, and that the Serbian economy will progress without the public debt growing. Now, that\'s the difference between those who sold fog and who never, at any time, thought about the economic foundations of the state. The start of the recovery path continues to implement real and public sector reforms will allow us to ensure rapid convergence towards European standards in the coming years. Increasing the share of investment in GDP to more than 20%, further reducing the share of state spending and increasing the share of goods and services in GDP to 60% will allow the cumulative growth of real GDP over the next four-year period, our estimate of more than 13% is conservative. I think that when you look at the fall we had in the period from 2008 to 2012, we can talk economically, unless there is an outside-politicalally different situation, about the golden age of the Serbian economy. Of course that depends on the international environment, because also because of Bregzit, we\'re going to have slightly lower growth of 0.1% to 0.2%, but we\'ve seen that all the negative parameters that came with Bregzit, we\'re going to remove our country and prepare ourselves in advance for that impact. I think we are one of the European countries that is very soft and in the easiest way possible to take that difficult blow to the whole European market. The government\'s priority will be to continue implementing reforms and further reduce irrational consumption, bureaucracy, unnecessary public sector costs, while at the same time improving the overall business and investment environment. The government opened a negotiating chapter 32 on financial control at the Second Intergovernmental Conference in December 2015 and adopted a programme for public finance reform for 2016-2020. For the first time in the Republic of Serbia, a medium-term reform framework has been prepared and adopted, whose actions and actions will improve the public finance management system as an integral part of the public administration and prepare it for effective and effective use of EU structural funds that Serbia will have access to to further co-financing of major development and infrastructure projects following the closure of accession negotiations and obtaining full membership. The reform programme from 2016 to 2020. The government will work to preserve macroeconomic stability and continue to reduce the fiscal deficit of public debt through the responsible management of public finances in Serbia. Our plan is to reduce the deficit to a sustainable level of 1% in the medium term. Maintaining this deficit, I\'m talking about the general government deficit, maintaining this deficit brings us to the debt level of 60% of GDP in 2023, so, with today\'s 72.5%, our plan is that in 2023, the share of public debt in GDP is only 60%, which meets the Mastricht criteria. We simply want to be better than many EU countries. We want to be better and more successful than them. Many of them have huge public debt participation in GDP. That\'s their concern, that\'s their pain, and we want to compare ourselves to the best for the future, because we\'re far behind so we can get there faster. The implementation of the reform measures set out in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policy, the Economic Reform Programme, the Public Finance Reform Programme will make a strong contribution to the improvement and management of public finances, as well as to the improvement of the business and investment environment. A hundred days of government. The implementation of fiscal consolidation measures has provided macro-economic and stability of public finances, without which it is impossible to provide the basis for sustainable economic growth. When an arrangement with the IMF was launched, it was planned structurally, when I say structurally means a permanent adjustment of 4% of GDP between 2015 and 2017. This permanent deficit reduction secures first stabilisation, and then reduces public debt participation in GDP. In the first year of implementation, it was planned to permanently reduce the deficit by 1.7%. With complete unity and agreement that it is necessary to return public finances on a sustainable path as soon as possible, we achieved a permanent adjustment in 2015, what the IMF recognised to us from 2.5% of GDP, 38% more than what we needed. Stronger adjustment in the first two years, 3.5% of the GDP cumulative programme, Serbia has provided itself with space to put emphasis on difficult structural reforms that need to be implemented in the next period with less strong macro-fiscal adjustment. The government\'s key task in the first 100 days is to implement fiscal policy measures to ensure that budget targets are met in 2016. The required structural deficit reduction is 0.7% of GDP. By achieving better fiscal results than planned, we will also achieve a greater structural adjustment of 1% of GDP. The key measures based on the continuation of fiscal consolidation remain on the bulky side of the budget. Rationalisation of the number of public administration employees, savings on all categories of current expenditure, from goods and services to all others, in order to create a fiscal space for public investment, which is beyond necessary to support economic growth. Otherwise, you\'ll see when we get there, at the Capex, in capital investments, we have better budget implementation on that side than last year, but I\'m still not satisfied it could still be better. It\'s our disease. When the ministers fight for your budget, that everyone takes everything, then you\'re not able to do it all the way, because it\'s probably a good minister who\'s looking for as much money as possible, and it\'s a good minister who\'s looking for less money, but what to do, I guess that\'s our delusion, from socialism left. They\'re just asking to spend as much as they can, and it doesn\'t matter what the economy is going down. That\'s what we\'re gonna change. To complete and confirm the results of the first wave of rationalisation through consistent implementation of decisions on the maximum number of employees by providing, monitoring and controlling the effects of rationalisation at all levels through an improved register of public sector employees. Prepare and implement a second stream of rationalisation in key sectors of health and education, through plans to reorganise these sectors based on deep functional analyses. To adopt a new law on the financing of local self-government in order to remove fiscal imbalances between central and local levels of government. In order for you to understand, we have a major problem, otherwise, to exclude 10 cities and municipalities in Serbia, and you will see, I am sure, in the debate, we will be able to talk about disastrous examples such as Smederjevska Palanka, Koseric and some others, where people are in charge for the next 500 years. That\'s where we don\'t know what to do. For, literally, the next 500 years. We don\'t know what to do, we pay huge money like the Serbian government, these local self-governments, and with all our paramannases, we can cure them for the next 100 years as the experts destroyed them and destroyed them. That\'s why we just want to have more control over it. Because, if we don\'t lie, so you can understand, it\'s done... That\'s right, Mr. Seselj, that was exactly the reason when they decided to support some of their municipalities so they could cross the censorship of a particular party, they were wasting everything that came into their hands, and now someone has to return it... (Vojislav Seselj, from the place: Canak does not believe. Someone\'s got to get it back. He\'ll get all the data, as much as tomorrow, whoever doesn\'t believe. So these are the things we\'re going to have to make right, if we want to ensure further stability. Amendments to the rules to be implemented at the same time will be made: taxes in the field of property taxation, taxes on holding and carrying goods, as well as the adoption of compensation laws. The new law will introduce a systematic approach on the location of transfers and the arrangement of original and applied revenues and improve the predictability of the system of financing local self-government, the efficiency of local self-government in collecting source revenues, as well as at the disposal of public funds. Improve conditions for local and economic development and the efficiency of the tax system. Establish a vertical balance in the distribution of income and jurisdiction between different levels of state. We\'re all doing it in agreement with the IMF, the World Bank, because this is one of the conditions. This is our prior action for signing, i.e. to approve the Fifth and Sixth revision of the IMF Agreement. The next task is to further strengthen the tax administration. Consistent implementation of the programme of transformation of the Tax Administration as an integral part of the Public Finance Reform Programme between 2016 and 2020 in order to improve payments and revenues. It is estimated that in 2015. So-called the VAT collection mechanism, and the collection mechanism is an indicator of the efficiency of VAT collection and the assessment of tax ejaculation or complimentary gap, (in English), was 15%. The goal is to reach 10% by 2020. That improvement in charge would lead to an increase in VAT revenues by as many as 88 billion dinars, which is as much as 1.8% of GDP in that period. This analytical indicator records a constant decline after 2008 and reaches a minimum of 20% in 2013. After that, we are slowly moving towards a more significant recovery, indicators of efficiency of VAT collection, and the latest analyses suggest that in 2015 the gap was reduced by five percentage points compared to the recorded minimum. All of this confirms that the first and significant steps in the fight against the gray economy have been made over the past two years, but it is very important that this process does not stop. It is necessary to set ambitious targets which will be measurable and comparable to the results in the environment and the EU. In the first 100 days, the Government\'s task is to adopt a fiscal strategy for the period 2017. - 2019. It sets out guidelines for economic and fiscal policy for the period 2017 to 2019. The medium-term economic and fiscal policy framework will ensure the successful completion of the programme with the IMF, the last year of the 2017 programme, just to achieve all objectives. I will remind you that the IMF also had a programme in 2011 signed with the Serbian government, but the IMF, as its head, escaped after only 27 days. Whether they were targeted or people fled because of failure to perform any of the tasks, none of the measures, shows enough why we were so unsuccessful or why some people were courting the people before the elections. To court the people, to court anyone I won\'t, and not to my mind. In 2018, the fiscal policy guidelines will ensure continued implementation of the sustainable fiscal position and continue to reduce the public to a sustainable level. According to preliminary estimates, public debt participation in GDP should be below 70% by the end of 2019, so by the end of the government\'s mandate. We\'re on a secure branch, we\'re safe, with a further tendency to descend below the Mastricht level in 2023 below 60%. A number of additional measures and activities will also be implemented to further reform public finances and improve economic governance. The government will propose to the National Assembly to adopt a plan system law that represents a framework for all overall planning in Serbia and to create the basis for achieving full efficiency in the integration of development planning and capital investment financing into the national budgetary plan framework. An analysis of the regulations will be carried out which are of an impact on the scope, conditions and purpose of public consumption in order to rationalise it. It will work to further improve the programme structure of the budget with a special emphasis on gender-responsible budgeting, determining the volume of spending per budget users. In order to improve public investment management, a regulation on content, method of preparation and evaluation, as well as monitoring and implementation and reporting on the realisation of capital projects will be adopted, which is otherwise very important, because we have so far paid interest only on undrawn funds and agreed funds, hundreds of millions of euros. Because everyone, especially before the elections, to show that he\'s a good minister, he\'s making new routes, new railways, new airports, he\'s making arrangements for everything new, and only the source of the funding is not known. That\'s where we\'ve had the situation of the previous, whatever you want, years. Then we make a deal for the loan, we don\'t withdraw the funds, but we have to pay for not withdrawing the funds, because we never planned well enough and because we didn\'t commit to it. Today it\'s something different. We\'ve closed most of the holes, but it\'s still not good, it\'s still not good. There\'s a lot of trouble with that. Furthermore, the measures will be implemented to improve the monitoring and analysis of the estimated financial effects of the laws and other regulations in order to allow for a realistic review of the financial effects that will affect the revenue and expenditure side of the budget, i.e. the financial plans of mandatory social insurance organisations for the current financial year and the next two fiscal years. A strategy for development and administration of customs duties will also be adopted for the period 2016 to 2020. It will continue its activities in curbing the grey economy of facial control that carry out unregistered activity. As you know, we\'ve never been able to do that before. In order for ordinary people to understand what it\'s all about, if you have a hairdresser shop, we could have sent all the inspections from different ministries, but if you\'re making a haircut in your apartment and you\'re not even registered as a hair salon, we had no right to enter as a state. So, we persecuted those who, at least in the good part, worked legally, thanks to the bad laws, and those who did absolutely illegal work, were not allowed to look at them, let alone touch them. This has changed the changes that we have made in the previous term, and in the future, we will say, perfecte and make it much fairer and much fairer. The work to implement the programmes financed by EU pre-accession funds will be intensified, so that in addition to the 12 contracts already signed in the first half of 2016, totalling 19.6m euros, additional six contracts will be used to support activities in the areas of traffic, environment, agriculture and the fight against corruption. We will adopt a strategy for further development of internal financial control in the public sector for 2016. – 2020, as well as the implementation of an entire set of measures towards supporting public resources users in strengthening the internal control system and providing internal audit functions and improving the work and functionality of the budgetary inspection. A strategy to combat irregularities and fraud in dealing with EU funds will also be adopted. In order to improve business conditions and achieve additional preconditions for attracting investment, areas of free zones will be expanded: Smederevo, Novi Sad, Sabac and Svilajnac. As you can see, we didn\'t choose where anyone was in power. On the contrary, we will continue to assist the municipalities and where someone else has a majority, not only those who are the majority here in the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia. We will begin building facilities for the needs of the company Lir in the free zone of Novi Sad. Also in Smederev, China\'s Meita Industrial in Belgrade\'s free zone. Priority will be dealt with by complaints of solutions relating to the realisation of capital projects of public interest, the construction of highways, the railway node ""Prokop"", the completion of works on the project ""Belgrade on Water"" recovery due to floods, construction of municipal and energy infrastructure. Activities will continue to prepare the Danube privatisation insurance, the privatisation process of the Commercial Bank, as well as the process of reorganisation and modernisation of the Bank of Postage Savings Bank with the aim of becoming a leader in the domestic banking market in business with citizens and entrepreneurs. The implementation of the strategy\'s strategy for solving problematic loans, whose realisation has already yielded positive tangible results on the market, will continue. If I\'m not mistaken, with 21% of the Jorgen women, we put it down to 18.6%, I just wanted to make sure I remembered right. Thank you, Governor. The first follow-up measure is the adoption of a law on the regulation of the profession of an evaluator of the value of immovableity. Don\'t let me tell you what kind of problems we\'re having and what kind of trouble we\'re having with the administrations of income in the territory of certain municipalities. That\'s why we can\'t do anything about it because everyone\'s scared somewhere and it\'s best to stay so dead and nothing changes anywhere. So they estimated a barracks in Negotin, you won\'t believe it at 19m euros. Imagine a barracks, walls estimated at 19m euros in Negotina. You can\'t get that in downtown Belgrade for anything so much money, but, well, someone\'s been looking for it. Of course we didn\'t do anything, of course we turned down a potential investor just because of these laws we haven\'t changed in time. We will start an independent professional business analysis of the Development Fund, the Export Insurance and Finance Agency and the Serbian Development Agency with the aim of clearly defining their role and improving performance. We expect much from the work of the Serbian Development Agency, it has already shown great and good results, and we expect even more from it in the future. It serves us for key development functions, but also enables efficient management of both natural, hostage and human resources to achieve sustainable economic growth and development. The reform programme from 2016 to 2017, so I talked about the first 100 days of the Government from the corner of the Ministry of Finance, I am now talking about the reform programme from the same angle for 2016 and 2017, strengthening fiscal responsibility and the budgetary framework. We will continue to implement the measures and activities of the Public Finance Reform Programme 2016. - 2020. We will strengthen legal institutional mechanisms to ensure that the results of fiscal balance are maintained. Strengthening these mechanisms will take place through two stages. First, full respect for the rules and the timeframe set out in our Budgetary System Act will be ensured. The budget process in the past has often failed to follow the rules of procedure and deadlines for adoption and adoption. Fully aware that the process of planning, defining policies and their realisation requires predictability and respect for the deadlines set, the reality of us is often, I would say almost always deny it. It will be a great task for us to fully comply with the so-called budget cycle and EU pre-accession. the European Semester. This task will be realised through EU accession negotiations under Chapter 17 - Economic and monetary issues. Martinovic, they\'re not looking at the phone, I see you on the screen. (Vojislav Seselj, from town: Klempo. Mr. Seselj, there\'s only one thing you should have learned. The physical characteristics of humans are no reason to respect anyone or not. I\'ve got a lot of major physical disadvantages than the clawy ears, and I think knowledge and one\'s morals and one\'s responsibility and one\'s industriousness is much more than your nose and your ears. I\'m afraid you\'ll have a hard time mastering it. (Vojislav Seselj, from the place: I did not say that his ears were clamping, but that he was klempo. )', 'Thank you. Dear chairman, respected ministers with co-worker, distinguished colleagues and fellow MPs, respected citizens of the Republic of Serbia, today we are discussing eight agreements and projects of great importance for the Republic of Serbia and whose value is, as Minister Mali said this morning, 768.8m euros. We had the opportunity to hear some technical details from the minister and therefore these agreements and projects are important for the Republic of Serbia. However, it is important to note that these projects are important for the region as they improve infrastructure, but also society in general, if we are talking about projects that seek to increase resilience to future risks associated with climate change. Although the agreements and projects we are talking about today and discussing are quite extensive, we have a much easier part of the job today. I\'m coming to a discussion in the tide is a fruit of hard work. Fellow Members and fellow MPs know that these are not the first agreements and projects we are discussing here at the tide, this is just a continuation of work to create a better future and a clear indication that Serbia is developing and moving forward. That speaks enough about Serbia\'s position in the world. As we know, Serbia today has friends in both the east and the west. One of our friends is the United Kingdom, with which we have been fostering relations since 1837, when the first bilateral agreement was signed. Co-operation with the UK is extremely important for the Republic of Serbia. According to the ministry\'s resolution, the trade in goods has been doubled over the past 10 years, and in 2017 it exceeds half a billion euros. So we see that in 10 years we\'ve been able to double the value of the trade. If we are talking about the previous period, just comparisons, when the president of Serbia was prime minister of Serbia, does anyone remember what the average salary was? The average salary was 330 euros. One dedicated and persistent work by President Aleksandr Vukic and his team in March of this year, despite the global problem that arose due to the pandemic of the coronary virus, the average salary was as much as 555 euros and we expect it to be 612 euros in January 2022. In addition, we are working to further raise salaries, with a desire to keep the minimum of 300 euros by the end of this year. Imagine the situation now, we had an average salary of 330 euros, with the disaster financing left behind by the former regime\'s representatives, and now, in 2021, we\'re talking about the minimum wage of 300 euros by the end of the year. So just compare the facts. On the one hand, people who used to work for a minimumer received 15,000 dinars, and by the end of this year should receive a minimumer of 35,000 dinars. And go back to working with the United Kingdom. The historic maximum in the trade was reached in 2019 and it was 557.4m euros. I\'m only saying this to see the importance of co-operation with the UK. The same year, in 2019, recorded the record value of our exports to the UK, which is 325.6m euros, which is 20.6% growth. We all know how much the coronal pandemic at global level has slowed everything down, but another indicator is that the Republic of Serbia has done well in this period and the fact that last year the value of total bilateral exchange was 529.4m euros, down from a minimum of 5%. On the other hand, according to official data from the National Bank of Serbia, the investment of United Kingdom residents in Serbia since 2010, with the third quarter of 2020, is 501.8m euros. It is one of the agreements we are talking about today that is also an agreement with the United Kingdom on trade, partnership in trade and co-operation with the corresponding declarations. What is the essence of this agreement? You\'ve heard the relationship we\'ve had with the United Kingdom so far. You\'ve seen what our trade was, how much it was worth, and you\'ve seen that we\'ve been able to double in the last ten years the value of the trade. In the previous period of co-operation between the Republic of Serbia and the United Kingdom was based on the SAA, therefore, an Agreement on Co-operation and Association, which because the United Kingdom has left the EU has ceased to apply. Now, the point is to enable the same regulatory form that we had with the United Kingdom before the SAA ceased to apply in that sense. The authorities covered by this agreement concern general state co-operation, co-operation in international organisations, security policy and the overall economic plan. I will allow myself to notice that most of this agreement applies to the economy and if we look at the results of this year, we have a growth in exports to the United Kingdom in the first four months. It is clear that we must enable our businesses to continue co-operation and it is necessary to maintain the same level of liberalisation of the trade in services and goods that existed before and was regulated by the SAA. If we didn\'t conclude, if we didn\'t conclude this agreement, the most endangered would be agriculture, or the agrarian industry, because the good portion of exports to the United Kingdom refers to raspberries, blackberries and others. The government of the Republic of Serbia has responded in due time to protect our interests in the United Kingdom market and many countries are struggling to gain the status that we are getting with this agreement. We get one serious and big market, and any delay would be extremely bad for our economy, because if we lose a particular market once, we can get it back, very hard, but we can get it back, and it costs us a lot more than trying to keep it, and we, as a safe and responsible authority, want to provide our citizens with the best conditions for business, and that is why this agreement today is in front of us for discussion in the tide. Several of the projects we are talking about today, we are discussing, is about improving the infrastructure in Serbia. The first project I\'m going to talk about is the first digital highway in Serbia. It is highway E 761 from Pojat to Preljina or Moravia Corridor, 112km long, which has multiple significance at the level of the Republic of Serbia. First of all, it connects the central parts of Serbia with the east and west directions, i.e. the two most significant routes of the state, corridors 10 and 11, belonging to the European road network. For this corridor, it is important to remind that the E75 highway, which matches the C arm of Pan-European Corridor 10, through which it connects with Belgrade and Central and Western Europe in the south and with the southern parts of the Republic of Serbia and Northern Macedonia, Bulgaria, further, if we go further, the Middle East, Asia, etc. It is an important and planned route of highway E763, Belgrade -- the southern Adriatic, with which it is planned to connect this corridor. This route would give the region the shortest link with Western Serbia, Montenegro, and via the port of Bar and southern Italy, as well as the sea ports of the Adriatic and Mediterranean. It is also one of the priorities set out in the plan ""Serbia 2025"". I thank the Corridors of Serbia for giving me both a map and detailed information for the purposes of today\'s session. Here, because of the citizens of the Republic of Serbia, to be seen better, is a slightly larger format, but I would be glad to pass the entire corridor, that the citizens of the Republic of Serbia see what we\'re talking about on the map. As we can see, the corridor goes from Pojat to Preljina and the route from Pojat to Preljina connects the territory of several municipalities and cities with almost half a million inhabitants. So a large number of inhabitants are gravitating this corridor and will have great significance from this corridor. These are: Cicevic, Varvarin, Kruševac, Trstenik, Vranjačka Banja, Kraljevo, Čačak. If we are talking about connecting with the network of state and local roads, there are plans for deniveled intersections, if we go in order, so, from Pojat to Preljina_Pojate, Cicevic, Kruševac East, Kruševac West, Velika Drenova, Trstenik, Vrnjačka Banja, Vrba, Kamijoor, Adrani and Preljina. I hope the citizens of the Republic of Serbia could see what the corridor looks like on the map. A total of 117 bridges were planned on the highway itself, according to Minister Mali, underpass and underpass in the total length of 11.3km. As part of the realization of the project, the Moravski Corridor will also implement the hydro-technical arrangement of West Morava and this is very important to mention. By doing so, the construction of this traffic facility improves infrastructure and increases the availability of municipal centres and economic areas, but also provides tourism organisations with the possibility of further development of economic and tourism potentials. When we talk about improving and modernising infrastructure, as well as improving institutional capacities in the Republic of Serbia, we must say that this is of multiple importance for the Republic of Serbia, but also for the region. One of the projects we are talking about today is a project to modernise the railway sector in Serbia, the first phase. The aim of this project is to increase the efficiency and security of existing railway assets and improve the governance and institutional capacity of the railway sector. And the improvement of this sector is of paramount importance to the Republic of Serbia, but also to the region, because it also brings indirect contributions to both improving and increasing living standards, because if we connect with the region we have a further chance of more traffic on goods, which is the essence of the economic policy of the Government of the Republic of Serbia. Another one of the projects that is important for the Republic of Serbia and the region, one of the priority projects that provides for the integration of the pipeline system of the Republic of Serbia with neighbouring countries, is the construction of a Niš-Dimitrovgrad gas interconnector – the Bulgarian border. By building this interconnector, which is 109 kilometers long, it allows natural gas to be added to the market and from other supply routes, and the gas pipeline capacity itself is 1.8 billion cubic metres, which means it will be able to meet about 80% of the current natural gas needs. I want to remind the public why this is so important. First, there are a number of limiting factors in the development of this part of energy. There is no pipeline network in all parts of the country, there is a marked seasonal imbalance in consumption, and the transit costs themselves are high. One problem is that domestic production covers some 20% of domestic consumption, and we all know that natural gas is such an energy that has a distinct technical and ecological advantage compared to other conventional fuels. If we look at only one household, the use of natural gas can satisfy between 80% and 85% of energy needs for some budgets. The fact is also that natural gas is a dominant import energy in which the transport system is limited capacity, so it is necessary to enable a system that allows natural gas to be used for combined electricity and heat consumption. As we can see, for the citizens of the Republic of Serbia, the construction of this interconnector is of paramount importance, as it improves the security of the supply of the Republic of Serbia, but we are going back to the region as well. This will include both the region and the Republic of Serbia. So, by building this interconnector, we are not only helping our citizens, but also helping the region, because we are aware, we repeat it again, and we are proud to point out that the Republic of Serbia will be able to move forward and only make progress if the region is progressing. It is important to note, Minister Mali said, that this project has been recognised as one of the six EU priority projects under the Energy Connecting Initiative of Central and Southeast Europe. We were talking about benefites. I\'ll just take a quick look at it one more time. The construction of this interconnector has multiple benefits. If we build it, we can expect more intensive use of natural gas in the wide-use sector, more efficient and more environmentally acceptable use of energy, as well as reduction of polluting matter. On the other hand, if we look at the possibility of using gas in the economy, we will see that there are greater possibilities for modernising and increasing the economics of many industrial processes, as well as an additional contribution to sustainable development in all sectors of the economy, which also reduces the impact on climate change and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. It is clear from all that I have stated that the Republic of Serbia is aware of climate change and is working intensively to provide environments that would mitigate impact, or negative impact on climate change. With this in mind, today we have two agreements dealing with increasing the resistance of the Republic of Serbia to future and potential risks associated with climate change. One refers to Serbia\'s programme support to boost climate resistance, while the other refers to a programme aimed at green recovery. Once again, there is a clear commitment of the Republic of Serbia to the green agenda. When we talk about risks that have been increased due to climate change, we should also mention floods and droughts. It is important to note that the Republic of Serbia and this problem have been approached strategically. The last project I will talk about is a project of integrated development of the Sava and Drina River corridor, whose intention is to reduce the risk of floods and droughts, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to improve and accelerate economic co-operation in the Western Balkans and strengthen the institutions and procedures through which the countries through which these two rivers work. This project aims to achieve the potential of economic growth while at the same time protecting the community from flood and drought damage, but allows, and we return to tourism again, the development of tourism on the corridors of these two rivers. For the very end, I want to point out once again the importance of today\'s agreements and projects. So, on the one hand, they talk about a strategic approach to solving problems and the fact that there is a serious and committed work behind them, and on the other hand today\'s agreements also talk about the clear intention of the Republic of Serbia to provide an adequate business environment in which it is possible to advance. This is a real example of the policy that Aleksandar Vucic and we all are fighting with him, a real example of how we change Serbia, because if we provide a good business environment, there are conditions for new jobs, new factories, new roads, as well as an increase in wages and pensions. We\'ll remind you that the growth rate in the first quarter of this year was amazing 15%. I will also remind you that the average salary, when Aleksandar Vukic became prime minister, was 330 euros, while in March this year the average salary was 555 euros. We expect, we will not stop there, that in January 2022, the average salary will be as much as 612 euros. So not so long ago, the minimum is, I\'m going to do it again, because it was very important, it was 15,000 dinars. By the end of this year, we plan to make the minimum minimum wage of 35,000 dinars. It is the first time in the history of the Republic of Serbia that the minimum one will be that much. These are the facts that we here today and we need to talk, and we need to talk, and we need to talk. Of course, neither this time nor any last time, we must and must not forget our older citizens, those who built the country for all of us. We want the pensioners to know they have someone to rely on. On the other hand, the former regime\'s representatives probably came from themselves, because they didn\'t believe that someone was going to work seriously and make reforms, and they were the ones that caused all of this in 2014 and we are where we are. President Aleksandar Vukic and the Government of the Republic of Serbia are making great efforts to provide the best business environment to meet our targets under the 2025 plan. So, we\'re going to have an average salary of 900 euros in 2025, to make the average pension 440 euros. The people see our work and see the results and the people of the Republic of Serbia know that what Aleksandar Vukic promises and fulfills it. It is not surprising, therefore, that according to the latest surveys, the support of the SNS in the people is 59.8% of the vote. However, that fact does not need to relax us. That fact obliges us to work even more, even more hard, and, as the slogan of our parliamentary group itself says, for our children. We need to help President Vukic fight for the progress of the Republic of Serbia even more strongly. For the sake of all this, on behalf of the parliamentary group Aleksandar Vukic – For our children, I call on all fellow Members and fellow Members of Parliament to support this agreement in the day of voting. Long live Serbia.']","<|system|>

Dear President of the Croatian Parliament, honourable MPs and MPs, I am pleased to present a report on the government\'s work in the first year of our second term. I am talking about the year in which we had 2 waves of pandemic, a devastating earthquake in Banovina after the one in Zagreb, which we started with the biggest GDP decline, and we are completing it with a record increase in energy prices, increasing climate change and a new wave of epidemics. This is also the year in which strong measures managed to preserve jobs, prevent a wave of bankruptcy and have the largest number of employees in the last 13 years. Also this is the year and strong economic recovery, the year in which we merged the Pelješki Bridge, completed the Istrian Ipsion, selected new Rafala fighter planes and ensured the visa waiver for the United States. In addition, we are in the final stage of preparing for entry into the Schengen area and the euro area. We strengthen Croatia\'s position in Europe, in the world, we develop relations with our neighbours, and at any time we protect Croatian national interests. Valuing work and excellence and building a tolerance society that respects its national minorities, as is the case with modern democracies, we are developing Croatia conscious of our potential. We are fully committed, encouraged by a stable and renewed support from the Croatian public, with the support of a responsible and strong parliamentary majority. A few words about the context in which we are located, and then about solutions that require the full engagement of society and state. First, it\'s a pandemic that\'s been going on for almost two years and has hit our lives and health a lot. Then it is the deepest economic crisis in almost 100 years, which of course caused by the pandemic and which has disrupted global trade flows. Then, it is a climate crisis due to the ever faster global warming that in the coming decades, with more extreme weather disasters is becoming increasingly difficult to hit our way of life. This is also a growing need for increasingly scarce energy, natural resources and raw materials that depend on our development and success in the global race in innovation and achieving technological sovereignty. Furthermore, there are increasing social changes due to the rapid technological change, digitalisation and roboticisation, changes in the labour market and the emergence of new forms that require faster adaptation of workers and their lifelong learning for new occupations. And in the end, these are unfavourable demographic trends. Rapid ageing of the population, the growing number of born and depopulations of rural areas in Europe, but of course in Croatia, which is a structural threat to economic development, agricultural potential and sustainability of the pension and health system. On top of these global challenges, we must also address the consequences of the devastating earthquakes that hit Zagreb and the surrounding area first, and then Banovina and other counties, and cause total damage estimated at 129 billion kuna. We need to use this not only to strengthen our resistance to earthquakes but to restore the economy and improve the quality of housing. We are aware of all the challenges that we are building a solid and just country, making sure that no one is excluded and left behind. With modern sovereignty, we are using Croatia\'s increasingly strong position in Europe and the world to achieve our national interests and raise the quality of life of our citizens. We included our goals in the National Development Strategy until 2030, which was adopted by the Croatian Parliament, which directs the country\'s development on the basis of a clear vision of our future. In achieving the rapid recovery, around EUR 25 billion of European funds will help us first from the multiannual financial framework and the National Recovery and Resistance Plan with which we have started, which contains 76 reforms and 146 investments. In this respect, in order to respond better to the global challenges mentioned, we will place a special emphasis on green transition, digital transformation and the country\'s demographic revitalisation. Under such circumstances, the great work ahead of us and the responsibility entrusted to us by Croatian citizens oblige us to continue to work more responsibly on reform steps. To succeed in our efforts, trust in Croatia, trust in institutions, trust in our own future, and in order to build mutual trust, we need to be responsible and serious, and this concerns politics, citizens, all actors in society, from economy to media, through academic community to civil society. Today I will present the Report through 5 pillars in accordance with the Government\'s programme, which is social security, perspective, economic sovereignty, strengthened statehood and global visibility. I note that since the start of the mandate, since July last year we have sent 200 bill proposals to HS, of which HS has already adopted 120. Dear MPs and MPs, at a time when we are still facing the greatest health threat in modern history, when the most vulnerable among us are the most exposed, our first priority is that everyone in need of social security and provide it in all its constituents. In this respect, the state, apart from its redistributive role towards the most needed, will need to further strengthen social solidarity mechanisms because in a world facing climate change disorders, the most sustainable will be the most solidarity of societies, and Croatian society at its core is a solidarity society. Social security primarily refers to the possibility for everyone to receive the necessary medical care, so in this response to the pandemic we continued to strengthen the health system, but also to ensure the availability and effectiveness of health care, despite the fact that the pandemic has already cost us 35 billion kuna, or 20% of the budget. In these more than 600 days of combating the virus, I would especially like to thank our healthcare professionals, doctors and medical staff on the sacrifice, as well as all stakeholders in the health and civil protection system who are trying to contain the spread of the infection. In addition to increasing the salaries of doctors and medical staff by 24% over the past 5 years, we have also provided Covid with an extra 10% hourly allowance for each hour in treatment with virus patients and have ensured that overtime is paid. We ensure the functionality of the health system, and we have paid an additional 8.5 billion kuna to cover debts to drug suppliers and consumer medical material, of which 6.3 billion have been in place since the start of the pandemic, which has enabled the smooth work of 165 health institutions. Unfortunately, more than 9,000 of our fellow citizens have lost battle with or from the virus, which has affected many families throughout Croatia and with whom we sincerely sympathise. These are painful numbers and much more than any campaign, this should be enough to warn everyone about the necessity of vaccination as the most effective protection from severe illnesses so far and the best we have. At least once a dose of 56% of adults and over 72% over 65 years of age has been vaccinated in Croatia, which is still not enough to contain the epidemic, and today\'s number of people infected is also talking about it. By cooling the number of confirmed cases in this 4th wave, the number of cases has increased rapidly, and this is the reason for more vaccination, but also for the vaccination of the 3rd dose, especially among the elderly. And in these circumstances, we have continued to invest in health care, especially with a major project to modernise health care and strengthen health infrastructure worth 2.4 billion kuna. We have brought a plan to revitalise the production of the Immunological Institute in order to become self-sufficient in the long term in the production of different vaccines and blood products. A National Strategic Framework Against Cancer has been adopted, for which we have provided 720 million kuna through the Recovery Plan. We are preparing a comprehensive health reform, to make the system more efficient and reduce costs into sustainable frameworks. Financial savings and rationalisation must be carried out within the system through transparent business, responsible management and pooling of public procurement and optimisation of purchase costs. When we know that the risk of poverty in Croatia is about 18.4%, another important aspect of social security is the fight against poverty, in order to continue to reduce inequalities in Croatian society, therefore we are keeping a special account of the effectiveness of the social care system that takes care of more than 600 thousand users. We have therefore prepared a reform of the social care system to better protect users and improve the organisation of the system. It is a special priority to give people with disabilities the same opportunities in education, in the labour market and in society. Of course, all through the policy of inclusiveness. Social security is also prevention and protection against violence. For the sake of more quality protection of victims of violence and stricter sanctioning of violent offenders, we have changed the law package which abolished the criminal act of sexual intercourse without consent and introduced the state of long-term suffering as a consequence of violence. In addition, there are no more statutes for the crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation of a child, which enables the perpetrator to be punished years after the crime. The term ""responsible person"" is extended to social workers, school employees and anyone who performs public-interest tasks, thus providing them with greater legal protection. In order to protect the most vulnerable citizens, we continued modernising the executive process and reduced its cost. Of course, we\'ve now ruled out the extent of those amounts that were previously subject to the exercise. It is important to protect the dignity of workers, but also to maintain the balance between creditors and debtors and to ensure the rule of law. For human reasons, we banned the raids from November 1st to April 1st, and we increased the main activity on the property from 20 to 40,000 kuna. Social security is also adequate pensions and material assistance to those with the lowest pensions. We have made it possible to pay the Covid bonus for pensioners whose pension incomes are lower than 4,000 kuna. The Covid Supplement has so far received 710,000 pensioners, which has been set aside from around 460 million kuna. In addition to providing income to older people who could not otherwise be provided, we have introduced a national compensation for older people of 800 kuna since the beginning of this year. In 5 years, the average pension increased by 432 kuna and in August was 2,866 kuna. We promised 5 years ago an increase of 5% in 4 years, and it increased by 18% but of course it\'s not enough for the very difficult and demanding life of our pensioners either. In addition, we continue to improve the first pension pillar and plan to increase our pension by another 10% by 2024. The minimum pension will gradually increase by 3%. 1.5% in \'23, 1.5% in \'25. of which 300,000 pensioners will benefit. This year, we have extended a circle of pensioners who can work half the time to family pensioners. Also, by raising the income censorship to 2,000 kuna per household member and to 2,500 kuna per single man, 120,000 more people will mostly have free supplementary insurance. Through the Zaželi programme, 14,000 women have been employed who provide house assistance services for 79,000 older people, especially in rural areas. In order to prevent a social fracture or a social divide that would dramatically increase the number of unemployed inevitably cause strong measures with more than 17 billion kunas to stand behind workers and entrepreneurs in the private sector and thus save more than 700,000 jobs, each of us also stabilised the business of 120,000 employers. The number of employees is 51,000 over last year. It reached a million and 600,000 employees which so far is the largest number of employees in August, which was a few months ago, two months ago, behind the record in 2008 and the second largest of independence. The unemployment rate that was at 13.3% five years ago fell to 7.3%. The result is an active employment policy measure in which around €5.5 billion was invested within 5 years, covering 165,000 people. In addition, despite the circumstances, average and minimum wages continue to rise. The average net salary in August was 7-118 kuna, which at the annual level was the nominal increase of 5.9% and 1,445 kuna, respectively, more than 5 years ago, and for the first time in February of this year it exceeded 7,000 kuna. I would like to remind you that from 2017 to today, we have increased the base for the calculation of salaries for state and public servants by 17% and 936 kuna respectively, while from 2012 to \'17. It didn\'t change. To financially support our most vulnerable citizens tomorrow, the government will make a decision we discussed Monday that will increase the minimum net wage by 350 kuna net from January. From 3,400 to 3,750 kuna or 500 EUR net after consultation with our social partners. This significant increase of as much as 10.3% for 51,000 employees is the first time we raise above 50% of the average salary and above 60% of the net media salary. In August, the media salary was 6.014 kuna. I remind you that 5 years ago, the minimum wage was 38% of the average, so in 5 years we will raise the minimum wage by 50%, or by 1.254 kuna or 4 times more than in the previous 3 governments. These are concrete measures for the benefit of the lowest-income employees. Under the recovery plan, we will invest 2 billion kuna for the labour market and social protection. We adapted the Law on the work of new occupations and made it possible to employ digital nomads among the first in the world. In order to adapt to new trends and ensure that no one is excluded in the dialogue with the social partners, we will continue to modernise labour legislation that will allow new forms of work such as remote work and ensure better working conditions for greater economic security of citizens. Strengthening civil society and protecting the rights of national minorities are among our priorities. We want a society that respects fundamental human rights, in which everyone feels equal and secure, and especially members of national minorities. In this spirit, in cooperation with representatives and parliamentary representatives of national minorities, we have adopted operational programmes for the period \'20-\'24. to continue to promote a culture of tolerance in accordance with the Constitution and the Constitutional Law on the Rights of National Minorities. We continue to support civil society organisations that have also been partners in supporting individual groups in society during this crisis. We hold regular half-year meetings with the Permanent Council of the Croatian Bishop\'s Conference and quality relations with the Catholic Church and all religious communities in Croatia. We have advanced the Voluntary Law to facilitate and encourage this form of socially beneficial civic action. Ladies and gentlemen, during the period of the 4th Industrial Revolution, competitiveness of the economy, demographic vitality of the population and the equipment of people with knowledge and skills are crucial for the perspective of Croatian society. After the pandemic and global recession brought GDP down by 8% last year, this year we expect a return to pre-crisis level, although we expected a growth of 5.2%, after a successful tourist season that still lasts and grows from 16.1% in the second quarter, we believe that we could reach an annual GDP growth of over 8%. It\'s on the trail of the ""under promiso over deliver"" wing. In the first 8 months of this year, industrial production increased by 8.3%, retail trade by 13.5, construction works volume index by 11.2, goods exports by 25.5%, tourist nights by 55%. At all expectations this year, we will be among the fastest growing economies in the EU, despite the pandemic, we have maintained a credit rating at investment level and that is also one of the elements of trust and reputation that we have both towards agencies and domestic and international financial markets. Already this year, we expect a reduction in the share of public debt in GDP by more than 2 percentage points, while the next years will be reduced by over 3 points. If it hadn\'t been for the pandemic, the economic crisis, our public debt would have been below 60% of GDP in two years. In doing so, the budget deficit will already be at 2.6% of GDP, meeting other convergence criteria, which will ensure that we achieve our goal and join the euro area as early as 1 January 2023. Based on the positive economic developments achieved and expectations of growth this year, we will return to the pre-crisis of GDP levels. Since August last year, 1.4 billion kuna has been paid to boost business competitiveness and strengthen the economy by applying research and innovation. It paid EUR 820 million for projects to develop innovation and EUR 172 million to increase capacity and improve production. In the 5th round of tax reform we have been implementing since the beginning of the year, we have reduced the profit tax rate from 12 to 10%, by 93% of companies with annual income to 7.5 million kuna. At the same time, we reduced the income tax rate from 24, to 20, from 36 to 30, which increased the income for citizens. This summer, about 150 thousand young people received a refund on the income tax of around 700 million kuna. This results in measures to exempt young people\'s income tax. In the past five rounds of tax cuts, citizens and the economy, we have charged 10 billion kuna. In order to encourage employment in deficit and over-needed craft professions, we have increased the number of student scholarships in question and doubled their amount. Over 4.5 thousand of these scholarships have been awarded over the past year, which in 4 years has provided us with 15 thousand scholarships, which is incomparably more than in 2015, when only 350 were. In addition, with 41 million kuna, we continue to encourage teaching students in crafts. The competitiveness of the economy depends on knowledge and skills and on the dynamics of the labour market. It is important for us that the education system be modern, that teachers and teachers be motivated and secure in their work and that students acquire knowledge and skills for future affairs, but also to strengthen their national identity and values. Further improvement of the education and education system encourages education reform and its evaluation, improving the status of educational and educational workers. Since the beginning of the year, we have increased salaries by 4% to educational staff and have increased their salaries by more than 20% since 2017. Here I would like to thank our teachers and all school workers, who have since the beginning of the pandemic shown their commitment to the development of education and new generations that build their own more perspective through the education system. In addition, we have guaranteed the status of an official and protected them from anonymous applications. We have initiated the creation of a school course critical opinion in primary school, which aims to teach students critical thinking about the world around them and learning with understanding. Significant efforts have been made to organise a pedagogical, school and academic year under pandemic conditions. By preparing 3 teaching models, we were able to respond to specific epidemiological conditions and ensure that the students were as many in the classrooms as possible. More than 2.2 billion kunas have been allocated for the restoration of infrastructure in education and science that has been damaged by the earthquake and 45 contracts for the reconstruction of 27 higher education and scientific institutions have been signed. With regard to higher education, about 14,000 scholarships are awarded annually, including in the STEM area and on a socio-economic basis. We encourage student work and have raised the student captain from 25.39 to 26.56 kuna, and after increasing the minimum salary from next year will rise to 29.9 kuna, which is twice as much as 5 years ago when it was 15 kuna. In the last five years. We have also provided record investment in science from European funds, as many as 3 billion kunas in order to provide scientists with the conditions for staying and working in Croatia. In the field of science and education, we are preparing new bill proposals that will encourage the development of day-long education in schools, start a pilot project of national exams and trial graduates, and contribute to the development and competitiveness of science, and to higher education. Under the circumstances of demographic ageing throughout Europe and the fall of birth, which increases the pressure on the sustainability of the pension and health system, demographic sustainability and vitality of Croatia are the issues on which our people\'s future and new generations depend. Turning demographic trends is therefore one of the most important issues on which we need to build a social consensus. First, we have directed measures for young people towards their education, scholarship, community involvement, and economic self-restraint through promoting employment to undefined, raising salaries and strengthening their creditworthiness, tax exemption or reduction, and resolving the housing issue, we have abolished professional training without establishing a working relationship and replaced it with traineeships, and we have raised to 130,000 kuna a measure of self-employment for young people with a business idea. We have targeted measures to strengthen the family on population, tax, social, and housing policies that increase household income, improve the balance of private and business life, and provide long-term family safety. We helped over 23,000 young families who resolved the housing issue through the POS programme or subsidisation of housing loans, which will continue until 2023 because it gave a positive demographic effect, in these families more than 4,100 children were born or adopted. With unprecedented investments, we have continued to improve material conditions in kindergartens in the past 5 years. 500 kindergartens are built or improved, which will also be financed through the recovery plan. In the last five years. We doubled the parental fee that applies to the other 6 months after delivery, and raised from 2,660 to 5,654 kuna, which is almost at the media pay level. As a demographic measure, we will raise it to 7,500 kuna for employed and self-employed parents next year, while at the same time introducing a father\'s leave of 10 days for employed and self-employed fathers and at the height of full pay. Measures to create a positive social atmosphere for the establishment or expansion of families, children and older focus on the active contribution of social and economic actors to the country\'s demographic revitalisation, such as municipalities, cities and counties, civil society organisations, and scientific and academic communities. Here I also think of employers who can provide better quality jobs and higher incomes for workers, which we have made possible through tax relief and better working conditions tailored to parents. Two important strategic documents are drawn up, a strategy for the demographic revitalisation of Croatia by 2030, and a National Youth Programme that will set a framework for the empowerment of young people and demographic restoration of Croatia. As you know, the implementation of the census was conducted for the first time both digitally and as a starting point for new population and other measures. The depopulation of rural areas of our villages, mountain-mounted and assisted areas, and the island are an added challenge for us to develop Croatia evenly in order to reduce the emigration of young people, and to give each and every one of our own an equal chance of developing and achieving our potentials. Therefore, balanced regional development is one of the pillars of our policy and partnership with the counties, cities and municipalities. We are working on the implementation of investments under the project Slavonia, Baranja and Srijem agreed on by 18 billion kuna, and we are also launching a development agreement for 5 northwestern counties worth 15 billion kuna, the adoption of a programme of social and economic revitalisation of assisted areas of Sisak-Moslavina County affected by the earthquake. In the development of assisted and mountain-mounted areas in 5g. A billion kuna has been invested, which is 8 times more than in the period \'11-\'16 and the adoption of a development programme for these areas is under way. The Island Act has been improved to exploit the island\'s large, natural, economic and tourist potential and improve the quality of life of the island\'s population. In the development of the island at 5. 11.5 billion kuna has been invested through various programmes from state and European funds. We have also introduced a new division of NUTS-2 regions into 4 regions, making the less developed parts of Croatia more positioned. We intend to launch and faster development of the Dalmatian Zagora, Gorski Kotar, Like and Banovina, and continue to strengthen cooperation. One of the most affected sectors in the pandemic was culture. We have ensured that culture is available throughout the pandemic, and institutions are open, and we have designed specific support programmes for the movement of cultural life, and production and distribution of cultural content. In the last year, we provided more than 400 million kuna of direct support and credit to help independent artists, art organisations and companies in the field of cultural and creative industries, including the media. The new Law on Electronic Media took special care of the Croatian cultural and creative industry by increasing quotas for Croatian music, as well as new sources of revenue for the production and recording of Croatian films and series. We have also reached a good consensus on the issue of regulation of comments and the contribution to curbing hate speech in the media and social networks. We have agreed 3.5 billion kuna for 150 reconstruction projects, through the Solidarity Fund a special programme has been developed for the restoration of the cultural historical whole of Petrinja, on which the government will restore the closest centre of Petrinja. In response to the pandemic to promote reading, 2021 was declared a year of reading. Also important segment of the activities of our citizens is the sport which, as we know, has contributed most to the affirmation of Croatia\'s recognizability in the world and nothing makes us more proud and happy than the grand success of our athletes. So this year we witnessed their brilliant successes with 8 Olympic and 7 Paralympic medals in Tokyo. That is why we are developing Croatia as a country of sports life and encourage our citizens in a healthier and more active way of life. For 5 years, we doubled the allocations for sports that reached 400 million kuna and allowed free sport for 150 000 citizens. We will also bring the Sport Act, improve the entire system and sports infrastructure, and encourage amateur, recreational, school and top-notch sports. Ladies and gentlemen, the pandemic that hit the whole world has pointed to the vulnerability of the global economy as well as to all states. It has disrupted global trade flows, which has contributed to a halt in agricultural, transport and logistics chains around the world. This reflected the increase in transport prices, products and materials in many sectors. It has inhabited the level of vulnerability of Europe due to its technological dependence on imports of products such as microchips that are key to car production, white techniques and other products containing electronic components. It is similar with medical protective equipment that at the beginning of the pandemic was also not enough in Europe. In addition to the long-standing issue of energy sovereignty, which has taken a new dimension with the latest rise in gas prices, the crisis has opened a debate on our technological sovereignty. This is a new challenge for the EU and Croatia to respond not only to remain competitive in the global competition, but also to avoid its developmental innovation capabilities being in other people\'s hands. We have therefore highlighted the importance of the country\'s economic sovereignty in the government\'s programme, which primarily includes achieving self-sufficiency in food and energy production, sustainable use of natural resources and sustainable tourism. In this regard, the natural beauty of our homeland at a time when the environment and biodiversity are more endangered than ever, we show our patriotism and our responsible behaviour towards our forests, water, air and sea. This is how we save Croatia for new generations. Conscious of this, we are developing a circular economy that seeks clean and low-carbon technologies and that better manages waste and transforms it into a resource. Therefore, we will continue to close waste disposals, introduce a waste disposal fee to reroute waste to the industry as raw materials. Oslonac is also a European green plan that promotes the green transformation process and with the assistance that the EU should become the first climate neutral continent by 2050. In the achievement of food self-sufficiency and food safety, the key role of the Croatian village, our agriculture and fisheries that form the strategic branch of our economy and are part of our traditions. In addition to the liquidity insurance in all repositories, only in agriculture, fisheries and forestry through various funds and national budgets over a billion kunas are available. After the first day of the earthquake, we stood behind our farmers, allowing for the continuation of the 120 million-dollar production to be ensured for the restoration of the destroyed agricultural potential. In the fishing sector last year, we reached a record value of 209m euros in exports, we continue to work on opening new markets for agricultural and fish products, as well as the availability of uninterrupted fish landing by investing in 13 fishing ports. We adopted at the Government of the Proposal for a Agriculture Strategy until 2030, which aims to increase Croatian agriculture to 30 billion kuna annually by 2030 and thus contribute to the country\'s food self-sufficiency. The recovery plan will also finance reforms that will improve the use of natural resources and contribute to strengthening the food supply chain. With food safety issues, it is also important to produce mainly based on fossil fuels, and we are increasingly seeing our exposure to energy market disturbances. It is therefore important to think strategically and develop a quality energy mix that will simultaneously ensure available, secure and clean energy for all of us. As you have seen, the government has reacted in a timely manner, stabilised the price of oil derivatives for 30 days, 11 and 11.10, respectively, and we will take other measures if necessary. Unlike many other European countries, gas prices in Croatia are stable and will remain stable until April 1st when we leave the heating zone. The price of electricity in Croatia is one of the lowest among 33 European countries, its stability is the fruit of precisely quality energy mix. In this context, we see the strategic importance of a natural gas terminal in Krk that we have opened at the beginning of the year and will contribute to the stability of the gas supply of our gas system and our energy independence in the long term. In the fight against climate change with renewable energy sources, nuclear energy also plays an important role, which also does not emit CO2 and has a significantly higher energy potential and can provide a stable supply that does not depend on weather conditions. Croatia co-owners 50% of the Krško nuclear power plant from which it receives 16% of its electricity. Therefore, recently, along with 9 other EU member states, it has pledged to recognise nuclear energy at Union level as low-carbon energy that is inevitable for an effective reduction in greenhouse gases. The pandemic has shown the vulnerability of the tourism sector, the need to strengthen its resilience to the future crisis and develop more sustainable forms of tourism. At the beginning of the year we established the national mark Safe staying Croatia and branded Croatia as a safe destination. We have secured a tourist season whose success was above all expectations. Since the beginning of the year, we have achieved 13.1 million arrivals, 82.3 million overnight stays, or 74% more arrivals and 54% more overnight stays than last year, and at the same time in 2019, which as we know was record, reached 67% of arrivals, 77% of overnight stays and 88% of the value of fiscalized accounts. That means we\'ve hit with balanced measures. Preparation for the next tourist season we are already working and at the end of this week we will hear on the Days of Croatian Tourism how to develop the Sustainable Tourism Development Strategy by 2030. In the more sustainable development of Croatia, there is a special importance in quality space management and energy efficiency in construction because of good planning and smart investment, saving energy and money and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Last year we co-financed the restoration of 3100 family houses worth 200 million kuna and for a new round of applications we secured 300 million kunas. In the construction phase, about 530 POS apartments are located at 15 locations. Construction plans are planned and 13 more locations. A draft programme to combat energy poverty has been developed using renewable energy sources in residential buildings in assisted areas. Given the reconstruction process, we expect a bigger investment cycle in the construction sector. Two devastating earthquakes have caused a really difficult blow to the housing fund. They damaged 53 796 buildings, of which 15 932 after the earthquake that struck Zagreb and 37 864 in Banovina. These earthquakes were an additional blow to many of our fellow citizens and a challenge for society that was to organise a complex financial set-up and a long-term reconstruction process in the middle of the pandemic. The most important thing was to organise a temporary accommodation in which 25 million kuna has been invested so far, covering 164 persons and will be financed until further notice. Emergency recoverys have been funded on the 1871 building. In order to establish a transparent process of reconstruction that includes not only construction works but also the preparation of project documentation, the Law on Reconstruction that we are now improving, which I believe the Parliament will vote on Friday to speed up the whole process in the return of those who have suffered by earthquake in their homes. The state will take over the financing of construction reconstruction, and we are also creating a framework for self-renovation for which the state will provide the necessary funds and for the owners of the apartment whose building has to be removed, the state will provide the replacement apartment at their request. We\'ve secured $5.1 billion from the European Social Fund, $5.9 billion from the Recovery Plan and $200 million from the World Bank. I apologize, from the European Solidarity Fund. The crises we\'ve been going through lately, so from the crisis in the biggest company of Agrokor 4.5 years ago, pandemics, earthquakes, the biggest economic crisis since II. The global war, the increase in energy prices and to all faster climate change, points to a key and irreparable role of the state. The strength of its institutions depends on the protection of citizens and the economy in an increasingly unstable and unsustainable world, which makes it an important priority for us to strengthen the state in response to all challenges and crises. This has been done before through raising the efficiency of public services and the resilience of public finances that we have achieved over the past year. In times of crisis as well as in the period of technological progress in which countries compete with innovation, it is important to overcome challenges that can be a threat to democratic institutions and systems such as false information, cyber threats, protection of personal data and privacy. To master these processes is important in order to preserve our values, rule of law and constitutional order. This must be a priority for all, including Croatia, to preserve constructive political dialogue with the fight against hate speech and false news so that citizens as key stakeholders of the democratic process can create their own court on the basis of verified, accurate and credible information. A terrorist attack on St. John\'s Square. Mark, a little over a year ago who performed a young and clearly radicalized person, showed consequences that could cause disinformation and the spread of hate speech. For this we still expect the answer from both the Croatian police and the State\'s Attorney\'s office. Our key objectives are to increase the efficiency of the judiciary. A reduction in the number of pending cases, the resolution of all cases older than 7 years in which the statute of limitations could take place in the next 3 years. We want to further reduce the number of pending cases by over 72,000 as well as the duration of proceedings in county and municipal courts from 283 to 200 days. We continued to digitise the judiciary, the E-script system was improved, a new E-communication module that allows electronic communication with courts. We are working on modernising, depoliticalising and professionalising a public administration that should be an effective service for citizens and the economy. Of course, we want to eradicate corruption which is one of the main obstacles to building a fairer and more developed society. The policy of this government is clear, if anything is proven, it has been proven to be untouchable. The DORH, USKOK and police are doing their job independently and no one is looking into secret reconnaissances, which is a key prerequisite to successfully fight corruption and crime. We want the punishments to be such that everyone realizes that corruption is not worth it. With the implementation of the Anti-Corruption Action Plan, which is at 90% of the implementation of all activities in our government\'s mandate, a new Anti-Corruption Strategy has been developed. It also prepares a package of laws aimed primarily at strengthening preventive anti-corruption mechanisms and bodies. One of the government\'s strategic goals is Croatia\'s entry into the euro area and adoption of the euro as a currency, thus achieving deeper integration into the EU, our economy further protects against external shocks and create assumptions for further growth in credit ratings. After 15 months ago, right after the parliamentary elections we entered the European Course Mechanism two days ago are in the final preparations for the transition to the euro. In order to avoid misunderstandings, Croatian citizens had already decided on this in the 2012 referendum when we decided to join the EU, it was part of our Accession Treaty, which was supported by citizens in the referendum, and then the assembly assembly seemed to me with only one abstention. I see that today there are certain political parties who have a second position, we respect that position, but we also point to facts and point to a huge difference between political parties that have actively contributed to Croatian membership in the EU in the past 30 years and those that are not. That optic isn\'t the same. What I\'m trying to say is that in the euro area while this unprecedented crisis caused by the pandemic will welcome us with something stronger than we have now. The currency risk for the population and businesses would not exist, the exchange costs of exchange of kuna in euro would disappear, we would have a lasting benefit from the pressure to reduce interest rates, the incentive to international exchange and investment would be lasting and great. Joining the euro area is important for our businessmen about two-thirds of the loans to businesses are foreign loans to the euro or to the foreign exchange clause in the euro. Over half 52% of total trade exports are focused on the euro area, 70% of total revenues from tourism are generated by guests from the euro area, and as you know in this process we have been running since 2018, motives have been chosen for future Croatian euro coins, where citizens have had the opportunity to present their proposal, the motives that have been selected by the Croatian chess industry as the basis of all coins, the geographical map of Croatia, Kuna, Nikola Tesla and Glagolitics, and the competition for selecting art solutions is ongoing. A few words about the transport sector that is the country\'s blood flow where the state has an important role to play to encourage investment in transport infrastructure in the development of the economy. We want to invest really more in the next period than we\'ve ever invested in HH. The year ahead will be the year when the Pelješki bridge will physically connect the south of Croatia with the rest of Croatia. There\'s no more sovereignist move than I\'ve been thinking for decades, and three key projects are behind us. One particularly important for the Istrian County, which is the completion of the full profile of the Istrian Ipsilon, the beginning of the construction of the second tunnel of the Učka tunnel, which is important for the highway network in Istria to be integrated with the network of highways in the second part of Croatia. The Svilaj bridge was built across the Sava which is an integral part of the pan-European road corridor VC, which will be completed in Baranja next year. 450 million kunas are invested in the development of Luke Rijeka as well as almost 90 million kunas in the upgrade of infrastructure and development of the Slavonski Brod Riverport. By investing in ports, waterfronts, harbors, we continue to renaissance on the Croatian coast where we have invested more than two billion kunas so far. In July this year, we made a decision on the modernisation and restructuring of the railway sector in which three billion euros will be invested, as I said. A flat project of free public rail transport has also been launched. A few for children and primary and secondary school students, that\'s 780,000 children. In addition to transport infrastructure, we want to improve digital transformation, build digital infrastructure for fast internet availability, further improve quality electronic services, digitise business in the state administration, improve digital skills among citizens. We redesigned an e-Citizen portal that today has over 1.5 million users, which is 25% more than six months ago, now 95% of electronic services are on the portal. For the first time, we spent the census in part and digitally, as many as 1.6 million of our citizens took advantage of that possibility. We have launched a Digital Croatia Strategy, we want to develop an information and communication sector that has a strong potential to increase our GDP because it is one of the fastest growing industries with an average annual growth rate of 12%. We are, as we know, exposed to great competition in such a globalised world, and that is why it is crucial that we take advantage of all the opportunities we have at our disposal. Our global identity is based on our identity and values. Only by strengthening our own awareness of our specialities will we create assumptions that we have a strong position on the political, energy, economic, investment, tourism and cultural map of the world. And that is why it is our obligation to cultivate our national identity, our history and tradition as well as the dignity of the Homeland War and Croatian defenders who make us proud, but also motivate us to be a more developed and influential country in Europe and the world. And therefore, in order to strengthen the position of Croatian defenders who are responsible for what we have free Croatia today, we have further advanced the Law on Croatian defenders, passed the Law on Civil Victims from the Homeland War, established veteran centres worth nearly 340 million kuna, continued with a programme of preventive systematic examinations of Croatian defenders who joined 72,600 Croatian defenders in 5.g. Lived over 5,000 victims of the Homeland War and precisely because we hold to the stone foundation of our statehood. After we declared Vukovar the place of a special homeland pitet this year, we first marked the 30th anniversary of the Battle of Vukovar, the turning battle of the Homeland War, and we pay special attention to the search for 1858 missing persons in the Homeland War and for this purpose we have brought a new Missing Persons Act. Croatia is a safe country, and we can thank all stakeholders of the home security system, police, military, civil protection, firefighters, HGSS, red cross and others. So we continued to strengthen all components of this system, equip and modernise the police and raise the effectiveness of crisis management systems. Croatia has met all the technical preconditions for entering the Schengen area and therefore at the moment we are working on political and diplomatic lobbying to make the decision soon. The Croatian border is day and night controlled by 6500 police officers who perform an important duty to protect the state border and not only the border crossings but also the green border, and I would like to mention that here we were a few days ago and finally something that we were 30. waiting, and this is Croatia\'s entry into the visa exemption programme for the United States. Croatia will also be one of 11 countries of which are only 3 European, Germany, Switzerland and the UK, whose citizens will have easier entry into the United States through the Global Entry system. We strengthen HV in order to raise our own defence capabilities, strengthen Croatia\'s credibility as an ally in NATO, and raise standards and conditions of work of soldiers, officers and officers, and they also played a major role in helping citizens after the earthquake. We have made a historic decision on the acquisition of 12 multi-purpose fighter aircraft, French rafts, which will strengthen Croatian Air Force and practically in the geographical radius from Austria to Greece does not have as strong military aviation as it will be in Croatia in 2024. We are in the process of preparing strategic documents on the defence strategy of the long-term development plan of the armed forces, all in order to strengthen the capabilities of the HV, and we are also strengthening the Croatian military industry. I also thank our firepowers, which are this great fire summer, not so much in Croatia, but as much as they have helped Greece and Turkey elsewhere in the Mediterranean and, of course, almost daily BiH. In an external political sense, we have strengthened our position within the EU and NATO, we have joined the Mediterranean 9 EU members, we are helping BiH, we are protecting the position of Croats who must be a truly equal constitutional people and have their legitimate representatives in BiH institutions and therefore we want a fair, fair and timely amendment of the electoral law. We have invested a strong protest with Serbia on the position of Croatian language in textbooks in Serbia, and we expect this rough inaccuracy to be corrected. We are also working on further steps for OECD membership. In a month, Croatia will visit for the first time bilaterally a French president who comes to my call and we think we will continue a good positioning in all multilateral forums and build good bilateral relations. In conclusion, I would like to stress that despite the many problems and challenges we face, probably with the mistakes we are doing honestly as a government based on the trust of our citizens and the trust we have received in HS, we are trying to manage in this troubled time in the interest and economic recovery and development and quality of our fellow citizens\' lives. We will continue to do so in the interest of Croatian citizens committed and engaged. We have what is most important, trust, and we have both knowledge and energy and will to bring together HS the best solutions for Croatia\'s development. And especially before us is the key challenge of this developmental 10th year of Croatia where we have more resources than ever to make up for what other Central and Eastern European countries have done in the \'90s and the first 10th years of 2000, and in this 10th year behind us and to make Croatia more developed and powerful, and for the process of demographic revitalisation to be great, I would say, a roof project of society and the entire people. Thank you for your attention.', ""Dear Vice-President of the Croatian Parliament, esteemed MPs, distinguished representatives in the Croatian Parliament. One year after I asked you for trust in the composition and programme of the Government, today I will inform the Croatian Parliament and the public about the state of the country, the problems our society faces and the activities that the Government is taking to make Croatia live and operate better. I want to give a review of the government's work, explain the decisions we have made and when they were not easy and present the direction Croatia enters 2018. This year, Croatia has been one of the most challenging since the end of the Homeland War, on an economic, political and social basis. Natural disasters, fires and floods, crisis in the Agrokor concert, arbitration procedures concerning INA, configuring parliamentary majority, work to reduce ideological divisions, a demanding international environment. In such a context and such a year, the government has fulfilled a significant part of the programme, and we continue with this work. I will present government activities in five thematic areas. First, putting man at the heart of politics, the second strengthening of the Croatian economy, the third positive social change that we are trying to build, the fourth national security, the fifth foreign and European policies. Today, after achieving the strategic national objectives, the focus of our policy must be people. A key element of every country. At the heart of every government move, therefore the Croatian man, with his concerns, hopes and expectations. From Ilock to Savudrija, from St. Martin to Mura, to Prevlaka, and also Croatians living outside Croatia, with their inalienable dignity, rights and responsibilities, regardless of sex, age, education, employment, sexual orientation and religion or ethicality. Our primary goal is to ensure a better quality of life, a higher standard of living, and the better opportunities for personal development, and we are committed to doing so every day. Our economy depends on people. It depends on people how we manage the country and people, the Croatian future depends on them. With that in mind, it is clear that finding a solution to the demographic challenges facing Croatia but also many other European countries is a key task of the government. This is exactly what makes Croatia the cornerstone of Croatia's overall development. Croatia has been demographically old for years and today we are one of the oldest European nations. Almost every five Croats are over 65 years old. In just one decade, since 2001-2011. Croatia has lost as much as 3.4% of its population, i.e. over 152000 people. It is almost one Split, and such a trend continued. Many parts of Croatia remain without people, the average number of children in the family is low, lower and than the number of children parents would like to have. More significant emigration from Croatia is also present in the past 4 years. Such demographic trends have negative effects on various areas of society, especially the economic, health and pension system. As a result, we have been taking this issue seriously, responsibly and strategically since the first term of office. There is no dilemma for us that growth in the economy and balanced regional development is the best demographic policy. Additional well-designed targeted measures, active population policies can make a difference. The Ministry of Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy reflects not only the government's political priorities but also enables quality design and implementation of progressive policies. In the first year of office, we have significantly increased financial support for parents. After 9 years of stagnation since 2008, the unemployment benefits were increased by 665 kuna, from 1 663 to 2 328, and the employed parents during the other 6 months from 1311 kuna from 2 660 to 3 991. We decided to subsidize 50% of the population loans to young people for the first 4 years, with an extension of another 2 years for each newborn or adopted child, thus facilitating the acquisition of first real estate, housing care and family establishment. 2 399 requests have been received so far that Vice-President Stromar for subsidisation has informed us and we will find the means for all to be approved. In the reform of the tax system, with a general reduction in tax burden, we increased the personal deduction for children with a marked rate of deduction for each of the following children. So the parents of the two children had previously been exempt from tax income up to 5,680 kuna net, and we raised that threshold to 8,000 kunas net. We also enabled the launch of a subsidy programme for the construction of new and adaptation of existing kindergartens. Since the harmonisation of measures of family, innovative, residential and migration policies exceeds the work of one ministry, we have set up a Council for Demographic Revitalisation which is currently preparing a new set of demographic measures that will be introduced next year, which will further improve the position of the family. For demographic restoration, the first task is to stop the process of youth leaving. By improving living conditions and by ensuring that excellence and pawnage are paid and rewarded. It is a demanding job that many countries face, but on it we will endure all the means available to start their families here, solve the housing issue, and live decently from their work. People have always been the most precious Croatian potential to invest in. Sustainable development of Croatia in the second decade of the 21st century is only possible through the promotion of innovation and creativity. That is why modernising education is the strategic issue of the Croatian future that requires a wider social agreement that we are building on. So we continued with educational reform including curricula as one of the basics of the modernization of the system. The government's goal is to launch pilot projects after completing the public debate and reviewing the curricula next school year to test the new educational programme. We try to respect and reconcile different views which is not always simple and takes time but is a prerequisite for the long-term success of the reform because it refers to the children of the parents of different worldview and beliefs. The new programme should connect the education system with the real needs of the labour market. Clearly rooted identity issues, value system, Croatian history, Croatian language and Croatian culture as well as wide, general knowledge and openness to the world. The world of intensive development, computer technology requires answers that will allow students to develop digital literacy. The introduction of information as a mandatory subject will ensure that students are taught in accordance with the practice of the most developed education systems with special commitment to the educational and breeding process that builds up the whole person. In order to ensure consistency on one of the key issues of Croatian society, we will restructure a special expert commission for the implementation of the strategy of science, education and technology. In addition to the plural involvement of experts, the ministries and the parliament that adopted the strategy, I will provide much more guidance on the content of the reform than on the bodies that should implement the reform. In doing so, one of the objectives is certainly an appropriate evaluation of the role that teachers, teachers and teachers play in maintaining the quality of the education system. The politics in which man is at the heart of us are also shown by the resuscitation of the Christian principle of solidarity, the care of the most vulnerable and marginalised social groups. We are building a whole and fair and transparent system of social care for people in need. Poor, sick, disabled, and those who need organised public care for age, addiction, or other reasons. Our solidarity as a society as a whole is reflected in the fact that for 3% of the poorest households we allocate 31% of the total funding in the welfare system. I try to ensure a decent life for older citizens after the end of the working life. During this year, more than 1.2 million people received 2.75% higher pensions in line with our current economic opportunities. This is not enough but the largest harmonisation of pensions after 9 years, since 2008 and threefold higher compared to the increase in 2016, the pension system needs to be adjusted to demographic and economic developments and to adjust the level of pensions. We have brought a new, fairer and more balanced executive law, which prohibits the implementation of the only real estate and prevents the unacceptable possibility that existed earlier, that the debtor's home be completed for the principal less than 20,000 kn. An increased amount that is excluded from the performance to the pay of the performer, i.e. 2/3 of the average salary. Recognizing the problem of domestic violence that we must face as a society, we have passed a more modern law that will in one place be worth the rights of victims of domestic violence, in accordance with international standards. We are fully committed to achieving equality between women and men and suppressing discrimination against women on the labour market, especially pregnant women and mothers. We're taking care of the position of the workers. Everyone must by his work be able to ensure a decent life for his family. As a result, the good news is that in a year, the average monthly net salary increased 5.1% and in the first 7 months, is 5951 kn. We've raised the minimum wage by 5%. Ladies and gentlemen, real shifts in living standards and sustainable economic growth can only be achieved by creating a positive business environment. Designing and implementing measures aimed at economic development and increasing competitiveness in line with the national reform programme is therefore a priority of the government's work. Surely the biggest reform process of the Croatian economy, which we could hardly imagine 12 months ago, when I asked you here for trust to build up the government, is crisis management in the Agrokor concert. It's worth reminding of the situation from only half a year ago. Several downgradings of the company's credit rating, warning of accounting irregularities, a drop in the cost of Agrokor's companies' shares, the launch of the first commission based on debtors, blocked accounts of Agrokor's companies, a halt in the supply of goods, emptying the shelves of the largest trade chain, indifference, audited Agrokor's financial reports showed the weight of the problems that existed in the company for years. All this in a company that employs more than 58,000 people, of which almost 30,000 in Croatia. Of which incomes are made by more than one citizen, which has a systemic impact on the entire Croatian economy. Uncontrollable bankruptcy and the collapse of Agrokor, which was then a real possibility, would have unsightly consequences on our industry, agriculture, tourism, budget, but above all, on tens of thousands of persons businessly related to Agrokor. Only consum suppliers employ nearly 150,000 people. Today it is clear to everyone that such a scenario was not to be allowed by the Government. We had the responsibility to find the right solution to prevent the escalation of the problem that has been created for years. There were four options. First, do nothing, watch as the domino collapses the Croatian economy from the front row. The second scenario would be to nationalise the company, which as a democratic EU member state based on the rule of law we could not consider. Thirdly, we could find funds that would give a certain liquidity to the company, thus trying to bridge the crisis in the short term, but that would not be a legal and sustainable solution. So based on the comparative analysis, we decided on 4 options. Law on the procedure of extraordinary management in trading societies of systemic importance for the Republic of Croatia. It complements the legal void that existed. We have shown that the state knows and can react quickly, efficiently and responsibly to demanding crisis situations. As a fundamental goal, our government has set stability, development, solidarity, but also a policy of restoring trust in the institution. And that also applies to the crisis with Agrokora. We acted coherently and legally, in accordance with our constitutional powers. We have proposed a legal solution that has prevented tsunamis on the entire Croatian economy. I would like to highlight the importance that all institutions, in accordance with the division of the government, shed light on all the circumstances of this case. It is known what is the government's task, as executive authorities, of the Croatian Parliament as legislative authorities, of the police, of the DORH and ultimately of the judiciary as judicial authorities. We also supported the talks on Agrokor in the Croatian Parliament. Although the legal framework makes it very clear that the investigative committee will stop working, if the competent judicial authorities initiate proceedings on matters to be addressed, we are open to discussion, that this topic is discussed in the Croatian Parliament, if not in this current commission, by law enforcement, then at committees or at plenary session. From the crisis of clean hands, we must come out together with learned lessons, this is an opportunity to transform business of economic operators on the Croatian market, but also of the entire Croatian society. The government will continue to work hard to preserve the stability of the economy and create conditions for its further growth. I believe that the overall resolution of the Agrokora situation will also be a final account with a long-standing unfair economic model. The esteemed representatives and representatives of the wind in the back for the transformation of the economy give us positive economic indicators. The Croatian industry continued with stable production growth, 2.6% in the first 8 months. Investments increased 4.2% in the first half of the year and we expect further acceleration. In the first half of the year, Croatian goods exports increased by 14.5% compared to the same period last year. GDP grew by 2.9% in the first half of the year by 2.7%. The good news and growth of retail trade has increased at an average rate of 5.2% in the first 8 months of this year. We have a record low unemployment rate of 10.8%. At the same time we also record employment growth in the second quarter of 2017 there are 26 thousand employees more than in 2016, i.e. almost 50,000 more than in 2015. Therefore, employment of 61.4% in the population from the 20th to 64th years is still below the European average but is the largest in Croatia over the past 6 years. The result is also an active employment policy measure that we are carrying out. In order to fully exploit the potential of domestic labour, we have secured over 2 billion kuna for employment. We specifically directed the measures towards education and training of the unemployed. And this year alone, we're going to cover about 50,000 people. We encourage individual entrepreneurship and encourage self-employment because this measure has proved to be one of the most successful. We have launched a 400 million kuna program for the employment of 3,000 women primarily in rural areas that will help 12 thousand old households. We are aware of the importance of the private sector as a medium-sized economy operator and we have therefore introduced a mandatory application of the test to small and medium-sized enterprises in the regulation to prevent new administrative burdens and unwarranted costs. We've cut some of the administrative fees by 30% and we'll cancel the part. We encourage crafts and vocational education, and have awarded over 1500 scholarships for students in deficit crafts interests worth nearly 14 million kunas. It's the highest number of such scholarships in one school year so far. For small and medium-sized entrepreneurs this year we have granted support of a billion-and-a-half kuna which is 3.5 times more than a year ago and we expect it to open or preserve more than 2,000 jobs. Only for the current academic year have we provided 4600 scholarships for the most vulnerable students and students 3400 scholarships for students of natural, biotechnical and technical sciences and by 2023 we plan to share 17 thousand STEM scholarships totalling more than 180 million kuna. We have started preparing the process of introducing the euro as an official currency in Croatia. All new EU members including Croatia have committed themselves to accepting the euro when conditions are met. Before becoming a member of the monetary union of the state, four criteria should be met with legal convergence: price stability, sustainability of public finances covering two criteria (a budget deficit and public debt), exchange rate stability and convergence of long-term interest rates. The structural reforms we implement contribute to meeting these conditions that we must implement for our own sake. Currently, Croatia meets almost all criteria except for one and, in terms of the general government and GDP debt ratio, a positive trend in dynamics is because economic recovery and the stability of public finances affect its reduction. For Croatia, therefore, meeting the criteria is an effective and realistic goal. A number of analyses and comparative experiences show that citizens and businesses can expect positive effects from the introduction of the euro. The main benefit would be to remove the currency risk to which all euro-related loans are exposed, euro-related enterprises, and revenues will no longer be vulnerable to exchange-depreciation. Secondly, the benefit should also come from the reduction of interest rates. The government will therefore, together with the CNB at the end of October, present a draft strategy for the introduction of the euro as an official currency in Croatia, starting a public debate on this process. Ladies and gentlemen, one of the reforms implemented that had an extremely broad impact on Croatian people was tax reform. We cut taxes, the tax system today is simpler and fairer than it was a year ago. The 16-law package at the very beginning of the mandate reduced the total tax burden of income by about 1.5 billion kuna. An additional 560,000 citizens have been exempt from paying income taxes, thus increasing the total number of non-income taxpayers to 1.5 million. The profit tax rate has been reduced from 20% to 18% and for small farmers, craftsmen and small entrepreneurs to 12%. With the Law on Local Taxes, we have left enough time to make a wider analysis of the system, conduct simulations and analyses, and propose the best solution. In the parliamentary debate, we also addressed the Law on the financing of units of local and regional self-government, as it will strengthen the fiscal capacity of local self-government and make income tax more fair. We have proven our responsibility in managing public finances. In a very short time, with the discipline of all members of the general state, we have stopped long-term negative trends such as the growth of deficits. We managed to reduce the deficit for 2016 to 0.8% and for the first time in many years there was a reduction in external debt. In the first term of this year, fiscal results are even better than expected. For the first time in recent history, a surplus of the general government budget has been recorded. And the trend of public debt cuts continues. Thanks to the measures implemented, Croatia came out of the excessive budget deficit procedure in June, but we are still aware that this does not mean that the process of financial consolidation is over. Until now, all 3 leading global rating agencies, which have improved the outlook for Croatian credit rating, and... has raised the outlook from stable to positive. [[The speaker doesn't understand.]] Our goal is to raise the Croatian credit rating to investment level as soon as possible, which is why we are unreservedly continuing structural reforms. The successful management of public finances, contributions and European funds. In the last 3 years, Croatia has agreed 2.8 billion euros, of which more than half during the first 8 months of this year. Furthermore, we have announced as much as 2.2 billion euros worth of tendering, which is 10.7 billion euros available to us in the multi-annual financial framework by 2020. These figures show an acceleration of the use of European funds, and we expect to contract almost significant projects in the transport, energy efficiency, natural heritage and water utility sectors. The government is seeking to revitalise state property that is of exceptional value. According to some estimates, its total value is greater than the total debt of the state. However, the value depends on whether the asset is managed. And unfortunately, it hasn't been effective enough in the last 25 years. We have therefore established the Ministry of State Property, whose mission is systematic and rational management and supervision of state property on behalf of and on behalf of Croatian citizens. We want to show that companies countries can be successful if they are responsible for leadership. And inactive state property, we put into function economic growth. We've established a central state office for the development of digital society. To make a step towards the digital economy, digitisation can relieve the state administration and increase efficiency. For example, the introduction of e-katstra services simplifies the electronic availability of data and contributes to the acceleration of the registration of real estate registrations. We are spreading a range of services in the system of e-citizens, which significantly saves time and money. We are aware that the development of infrastructure and services is widely-explained Internet access one of the preconditions for the development of a modern economy and we will increase its availability. I would like to note that recently at the EU summit dedicated to the digital economy in society, the agendas, we could notice that the steps made by Croatia, especially in health care or e-receptions, are among the more innovative among EU members. And therefore we are in this area even better than it seems. The energy sector should be one of the most important generators for the development of the Croatian economy. We must use the favourable geostrategic position of Croatia to ensure the supply of the Croatian market. One of the key projects is the construction of a LNG terminal in Krk, whose construction will take a significant place on the map of Europe as a new energy centre. And for the realisation of this project, we have provided significant European resources. One of the more complex exports to the energy sector, which found this government, is the issue of our oil company INA. We made a strategic, political decision on the return of INA owned by the state, which we also met the Hungarian authorities. We set up a consultation on negotiations with MOL, which discussed funding models, and a selection process was launched by two competent ministries, environmental protection and energy protection and the Ministry of Finance. The process is complex and we approach it in the way it is demanding, which is cautious and gradual, but with a clear goal, INA in the service of the development of the Croatian economy. It is unquestionable that MOL and I have a disagreement, but there is a clear interest that INA as a national and strategic important oil companies is working well. We want it to contain all features of vertically integrated companies, and to invest in research production and processing. There is a parallel arbitration procedure, which is the international centre, to resolve investment disputes in Washington, which was launched by MOL in 2013. All competent authorities are almost daily engaged in the case. The second arbitration procedure launched by Croatia ended in a river, was delivered on 24.12. and which is not favourable for us. The acquis maintains the status quo of management of the INA and we, as a country dedicated to the rule of law, respect it, yet using the opportunities at our disposal we have requested its annulment. One of the goals of the government is to continue investment in Croatia's transport integration. From air to road, river, port and rail traffic. With that goal in the first year, we started but ended a number of investments. We have ensured continued funding for the second phase of the construction of Dubrovnik airport, with the European co-financing of 1.2 billion kuna. We opened a new modern passenger terminal in Zagreb, and then I thanked the work of previous governments. The European co-financing of the reconstruction and construction of the railway railway Križevci-Koprivnica, a state border of 241m euros, has been ensured. We have also made a major step in realising the strategic project to connect the south of Croatia with the rest of the country, in building the Peljega Bridge. The European Commission co-finances 357m euros in construction and will be one of the most visible projects showing the concrete benefit of Croatia's EU membership. The procurement process is under way and three tenders received are being analysed. The Peljeski bridge will connect two parts of our country and allow for a better connection and the technical gauges of the bridge were agreed with BiH as early as 2006 where Croatia met the demands of our neighbouring country and thus opened the possibility of this project being realised. I repeat once again on the edge of the bridge are built exclusively on the territory of Croatia, and the bridge will be located above the sea space belonging to Croatia. so that it cannot accept certain requirements that now want to condition the construction of a bridge with unrelated political issues that is a matter of demarcation at sea and we will solve them, but the issue of building a bridge with demarcation has nothing to do with it. We are systematically introducing order into agriculture. A sector with great development possibilities. There are over a billion kuna worth of projects in realisation. We simplified the procedures for European competitions and shortened the deadlines for processing. We care about the quality of food that is eaten in Croatia. We created the possibility for public authorities to get food that travels from field to table for up to 48 hours. We spent increased food surveillance sold in chains and made it public. By changing the laws of the OPGs, we will expand their activities, put in place abandoned land and protect domestic producers from unfair trading practices in the food supply chain. Today, we sent a second reading of the proposed laws to the Assembly. We've also secured 150 million kuna for the recovery of agricultural damage after the fires, fighting and floods. The government takes care of environmental protection and builds a modern waste management system. We have accelerated our activities to address the problem of air pollution in Slavonski Brod as soon as possible. We've created preconditions to facilitate the refinery's gasification of the ship, which will improve the air protection state. We have launched a program of energy reconstruction of buildings including kindergartens, schools and dormitories. It is expected that only by the beginning of 2019, investments in the construction sector will exceed 1.7 billion kuna in energy recovery, and the restoration of buildings with minimal insulation can save up to 5 billion kuna. We have built a strategy for the spatial development of Croatia, a fundamental state document for the direction of development in space. This tourist season is the best in Croatian history, including pre-war years. This year we will reach a figure of as much as 100 million overnights, 17 million arrivals, and we expect revenue of almost 11 billion euros, which is as much as 700 to 800 million euros more than last year. By 2020, we aim to achieve 14 to 15 billion euros in revenue this year, we have achieved over 800m euros in investment in tourism, and next year we plan to reach almost a billion euros mainly through new and newly renovated hotels. Respected MPs and MPs, while raising the quality of life of citizens, is the government's continuing task of raising general social standards and transforming the polarised social climate. The Croatian Society of the 21st century must enable constructive dialogue between different actors and groups. We want to develop a toleranceal, plural and democratic society by opposing discrimination and hate speech that we often witness too often, on a global scale, and in Croatia as well, growing surface and sensationalism in public life. Such trends are also evident in strengthening political forces that offer simple, almost instant solutions to complex problems. In the first year of office, our government has shown a consistent fight against demagogy and populism, arguments and expertise. One of the topics where they try to impose a quick and simple but proven ineffective solution is the issue of facing the past. In Croatia, ideological and historical topics are often referred to as scarred and uncritical. We've chosen for the second time, and we're very clear about it. We give pitet to numerous Croatian families who have been victims of tragic human rights abuses and violations by non-democratic systems. We have established a Council to deal with the consequences of the rule of non-democratic regimes that have two tasks. First, to develop comprehensive measures that will contribute to the face-to-face with the past, such as scientific research and the provision of access to public data, and to fostering memory culture and others, to make recommendations on the permission to use non-democratic symbols. Such a systematic approach is more demanding and we are the first government to accept it because we believe it is possible to make real moves in the face of our society with the consequences of a non-democratic government. Very openly, in the early 1990s, Croatia was a victim of aggression and had other priorities. Other Middle Eastern European countries then addressed these issues and we did not and therefore they are on the agenda of Croatian societies at this time. We are building partnerships with civil society, religious communities and the academic community because they can contribute to creating a better society with their different perspectives. We introduce social dialogue with respect and respect for employers and trade unions. After increasing salaries to state and public officials in September, we started a new cycle of talks on collective agreements. I am particularly pleased that we enjoy the support of all 8 representatives of national minorities in the Croatian Parliament. In our dialogue with them, we have built operational programmes for national minorities since 2017-2020, a mechanism to support their public action and protect their rights. For the sake of quality communication of different levels of government, we have established a practice of regular government meetings with mayors, representatives of the Association of Cities and Association of municipalities. And after local elections where citizens have chosen new 4-year-old representatives, we continue co-operation and co-ordination. In the first year of my term, I have visited our homeland several times to get acquainted with key issues, priorities and plans at the county level. We held meetings of the Government in Vukovar, Sisak and Knin, and in early December we will also be in Osijek. To encourage debates of local and regional importance and to confirm commitment to even development. We designed and implemented the project Slavonia, Baranja and Srijem. After the Homeland War, the country faces particularly pronounced challenges of unemployment, deindustry and negative demographic trends. So by 2020, we are planning as much as 2.5 billion euros in financial injections for the development of agriculture, rural regional development, transport, energy and the economy. We have launched legislative reforms and in order to strengthen the assisted areas and encourage the development of Croatian islands, and have adopted the Strategy for Regional Development. The inclusion of Croats living outside Croatia in the country's social and political life is one of our strategic goals. We have begun to facilitate the process of obtaining citizenship for members of the Croatian people, their descendants and spouses. We promote Croatian identity, culture and language. The Croats outside Croatia will try to get even more involved in the country's social life, which is why we will analyse the possibility of making elections easier. Ladies and gentlemen, in Croatia, there is a large number of different cultural institutions whose role is important, not only to preserve our identity and heritage but also to today be part of a growing economic branch, or creative industry, whose development we systematically encourage. Already in the first year of the term of office, funding for cultural programmes and projects increased by 3.2% and even 20%, respectively, if out-of- budget users and European funds were added. Attracting audiences and participating in culture as a priority objective of cultural policy, we seek to ensure and finance specific projects. In order to strengthen the crisis of literary and publishing activity, we financed additional measures, including the opening of new bookstores across the country. The rule of law is based on an independent, impartial and effective judiciary. We therefore reform the executive process, introduce information technologies, speed up the procedure for the appointment of judicial officials and improve procedural and material legislation. We will simplify and speed up the procedure for the appointment of judicial officials, carry out organisational changes involving mergers of criminal and municipal courts, and complete the long-awaited project of the integration of land books and catastras. We are creating a professional, modern and rational public administration that is an integral part of an effective business environment. We have therefore also adopted an Action Plan for the implementation of the Public Administration Development Strategy for the period 2017 to 2020, which digitises the processes and establishes a unique way of communicating citizens with state administration bodies. We want a predictable, legal, tax framework, transparent public procurement, a continuation of the fight against corruption. The main objective of the health system is complete health security within a modern and financially sustainable system, which is a demanding task. We want to improve the quality of health services by bringing about a national hospital development plan that provides for functional integration and better management of non-health services. Stopping unnecessary multiplication of procedures at small geographical distances. We are preparing a pooled supply of medicines and consumables as measures for staying between other and young doctors in Croatia and easier to get specialization. We're on our way to modernising 29 hospitals, hospital equipment and improving working conditions. We provided funds for the construction of a new hospital in Rijeka and started preparing for the construction of a new, unique children's hospital in Zagreb. Despite all this, we need to do even more to ensure that health services are available and more rationally using hospital resources. Due to the new security challenges, we have devoted ourselves to increasing the coordination and proactiveness of the Croatian state institutions in the area of national security protection. After 15 years, we adopted a new National Security Strategy. A strategic document that began the process of developing the Homeland Security System, we increased the defence budget after 6 years of decline, a strong tradition of the defence army, the winning one, obliging us to a thorough and thoughtful modernisation. This represents a certain cost but modern threats require greater investment in security without which we have no economic growth. Modernising our forces is also increasing our credibility as allies in NATO and partners in the EU and participants in a number of UN missions. Because of this, we have decided to obtain multi-purpose fighter aircraft to protect airspace, which means increased defence capacity, but also creating a special partnership, we will make the choice decision in the coming months. This year we returned the Armed Forces unit to Sinj and in 20 days it is expected that members of the Croatian army will arrive in the heroic city of Vukovar. Next year we will return troops of Croatian troops to Ploče, as well as Puma in Varazdin. The Croatian defence industry is a generator for the development and promotion of top products. In this regard, I am very pleased that the 7th Croatian Contingent was sent to NATO for the first time by a mission of support in Afghanistan, fully equipped with Croatian weapons and equipment. We're increasing the standard of living, working and training of soldiers, officers and officers of the Armed Forces. He would especially like to thank the Armed Forces for their contribution during recent fires and floods, as they managed to protect human lives and minimise material damage along with firefighters and other parts of the system. With unusual intensity and scope, Croatia hit natural disasters in 2017. In more than 6,000 fires, an area of about 1,000 square kilometers was burned, which is equal to the total surface area of Hvar, Brac and Korčula and almost 3 times the annual average, and in September, Zadar County hit the worst floods ever recorded in the area. However, the consequences for human lives, public infrastructure and facilities were not great, especially compared to the fires in other European countries and you saw today this disaster in Portugal or the examples of terrible victims in the United States. But the fire season has shown that there is a space for improving mutual coordination in crisis situations, especially in crisis communication. In gratitude, but also in need, we have allocated 7.6 million kuna to firemen and certain funds to pilots and mechanics of our canadians who have completed countless hours of flights in this fire season. What I'm saying is that because of the fire, the police have detained more people and filed criminal charges against them. It is very important that the perpetrators of these crimes are investigated to the end and thus determine the character of such large numbers of fires in 2017. In addition to caring for the position of active Croatian soldiers, we want to ensure dignity for Croatian defenders and to cherish the memory of their sacrifice and victory in the Homeland War. The most responsible for defending the homeland without which we could not freely discuss here today how to manage the country, we are obliged to provide adequate care. That is why, as promised in the campaign, we have developed a new comprehensive law. In one place, the rights of defenders and victims of war are united, thus ensuring their legal and existential security. Since September, 37,000 Croatian defenders and victims of the Homeland War receive 10% higher pensions. We continuously provide Croatian defenders and care for their health and that is the goal of this unique law. Dear MPs and MPs, an important part of the Homeland Security system is also the Croatian police we modernise and professionalise. We simplify administrative affairs like the issue of documents. The driver's license can now be requested by the E-Citizen system, without arriving at the police station counters. We appointed the leaders of individual MIPs based on the expertise of selected personnel. Much of the MUP's work concerns meeting the criteria for entry into the Schengen area, a single European borderless area, which is a strategic and national objective. We want to achieve technical readiness to enter a single European space during 2018 to enter Schengen in the current European Commission's mandate during 2019. Since June, we have been connected to the Schengen Information System through which data is automatically obtained on each person, vehicle or ID. I would also like to mention the agreement with Slovenian Prime Minister Cerar on 29 April this year at a joint meeting with Commission President Juncker when we agreed to move from systems to targeted controls following the revised Schengen law. This agreement has enabled a significantly greater flow of people, tourists in Croatia, because if rigid systemic control was retained, I fear that at the peak of the tourist season miles of waiting to leave Slovenia and entering Croatia, they would be about from Bregana to Ljubljana. When it comes to the external-political dimension of our activities in European affairs, I want to single out a few highlights. First, to remind us that in this 2017 together and here in the Croatian Parliament we marked the 25th anniversary of the country's international recognition and our membership in the UN. I also mentioned this in a speech to the UN General Assembly a few weeks ago where we remembered the speech of the first President Tudjman then in New York and the difficult circumstances of the imposed war and aggression on Croatia. We are proud of the fact that today we are actively contributing to international security because only twenty years ago we were on the side of those who are the recipient of security and today we are among active donors and those who share their experiences, which unfortunately are unique on the European continent. When it comes to European affairs, I would like to say that we are part of the most developed community of EU countries, whose opportunities we are trying to make the most of. We are involved in creating European policies and discussing Europe's future. At a time when the dominant is the topic of the exit of the united kingdom from the EU and which via facts imposes topics that are not affirmative. Therefore, together with other partners, we seek to inhale ambition, a new elan and draw the maximum for citizens of all Member States on the basis of existing contracts, policies and budgets from the European project. Therefore, for more levels of involvement in European affairs, for a year and a regular reporting of the Croatian Parliament, after a session of the European Council. All in order for all of us to be much more sensitive to these topics together, when the Croatian EU presidency comes in the first half of 2020. We remain one of the main advocates of the continuation of the enlargement policy, in particular to the countries of Southeast Europe, and we want to be part of those Member States who want to strengthen co-operation as part of a tight round of the European integration process. Croatia is paying great attention to cooperation with the neighbouring BIH with which we are bound by special connections. The European future of the BIH is a political priority for us, as co-signator of the Dayton Agreement, is extremely important for us, ensuring equal rights for the three constituent peoples of the Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks, which must also be guaranteed in the electoral legislation. After 7 years, we organised a successful joint session of the government and the Council of Ministers of BiH in July in Sarajevo. With relations with Serbia, we have open issues from the time of independence, and aggression against Croatia, which includes the issue of missing, cultural goods, but also the regional jurisdiction of the Serbian law on war crimes. We don't accept the falsification of historical truth. As I said on the day of the victory in Knin, Croatia is failing the Homeland War, just as Croatian defenders did not give in Croatia in the '90s. With regard to relations with Slovenia, we have also faced a question that our country has been following since independence, not resolved by the border, Croatia's decision of the arbitration court is not binding and we will not apply it. There are no dilemmas. In July 2015, the Parliament was decoded. That decision was made by consensus. We, in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of International Contracts, have launched a procedure for the termination of the arbitration agreement and have withdrawn from the process. We did so because it revealed the illegal action of the other side. I do not believe that any other country in the world would allow its state borders to be decided in procedures in which no minimum of independence and impartiality is guaranteed. The same cannot be expected of Croatia. But Croatia wants dialogue with Slovenia, wants to talk and wants dialogue, wants to talk and wants to resolve open issues, and once again I call on Slovenia to dialogue and continue on this letter of the diameter of Cerara yesterday, I repeat that on 12 July in Ljubljana, I said that we are open to resolving all open issues by including the border of bilateral talks between the two countries. In international relations, Croatia advocates respect for the rule of law, our diplomatic and consular representations are daily in a position to provide various forms of assistance to our citizens. A new embassy in Kuwait opened for a larger engagement in the Middle East. And in the opening procedure are the embassy in Korea, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. General consulates with special interests in BIH, Livn and Knights, we have returned the positive practice of developed diplomacy and organized a traditional annual gathering of ambassadors and general consuls. And we'll do it every time after the first cabinet session in late August after the summer break. Ladies and gentlemen, in one of the most challenging years since the end of the Homeland War, we have been trying to regain our trust in institutions, politics, government, the Croatian Parliament. We act responsibly and legally, the approach we have since the first day, puts at the heart of politics, every Croatian citizen. Which is where we take special care of vulnerable social groups. I am convinced that many of our moves have positively affected the Croatian economy and society, and I will stress in this summary, just some of the most important. First, the collapse of Agrokor, whose causes were not involved, was prevented, but whose backdrops would be disastrous for its workers, suppliers, and the entire economic and financial system. Our measures encourage economic growth, increased employment, exports and industrial production, and the effects of tax reform are positive for both citizens and entrepreneurs. We have systematically accessed the topics of demographic renewal, the face of the past, educated reforms, the digitisation of Croatian defenders. We developed a new concept of national security and homeland security, and started modernising the armed forces. We are working intensively on Croatia's entry into Schengen and taking over the euro as an official currency. In the European context, Croatia is as recognizable as that member who wants to be part of the first round of European integration, while protecting the national interests and position of our citizens in the EU. All this shows that we are ready to make decisive moves, that the challenges facing modern society cannot be solved overnight, and not in any first year of office is already part of the process and work through the four-year framework. I believe that in the first year, the government has achieved a large part of its programme that improves the lives of our citizens and society as a whole, we will continue through the Government programme and through the National Reform Programme and through the creation of a tolerant, inclusive climate in Croatian society. And I would therefore like to underline that those 4 basic points that I said here last year are political stability in the country, economic growth and development, legal certainty and social cohesion and solidarity will continue to be the central points of government work and the framework for taking all the measures and legal proposals that we will present here in the Croatian Parliament. Thank you very much for your attention."", ""Dear President of the Croatian Parliament, distinguished MPs and MPs. Today, I have the honour to report on the work of the government in the second year of our mandate, which, by ensuring both political and economic stability, has continued and started with changes that make our fellow citizens' lives more quality. Building a more orderly society and a stimulating economic environment today is more important than ever, in order to catch a step with the countries that entered the EU almost a decade before us by reform and dedicated work. In order to fully understand our activities, I must remind myself that we have found a divided society, political instability, high unemployment, negative demographic trends, an unsustainable pension system and a large number of blocked citizens with too much tax burden, not public finances, slow use of European funds and implementation of structural reforms. We also had a crisis of systemic proportions in Agrokor as well as a number of other inherited issues of economic transition. We are aware that some of the results are faster and that there is a need for more time somewhere but it is clear that the reforms we are doing are already giving concrete results at an economic, political and social level. Economic growth is sought through the triangle, structural changes based on the national reform programme, investment and responsible fiscal policy. In other words, we must work better, invest more, and manage the budget more wisely. With our actions, we have sought to launch strategic projects, develop a culture of political dialogue, respect for the rule of law and democratic standards to bring them to a higher level. Although we act in an atmosphere where pessimism and defetism, dedicated work, and the gradual transformation of society, we want to restore the necessary optimism to people. In this context, we seek to develop cooperation with all relevant actors, employers, trade unions, academic community, professional and not government associations, media, counties, cities and municipalities. 266 laws have been passed on the government's initiative since the start of the mandate. In the vast majority, through regular procedure and public consultation. In the past year we continued to hold meetings of the government and meetings with the mayors and representatives of associations of cities and municipalities throughout Croatia. I am particularly pleased that all 8 national minority deputies support the government and that in a partnership relationship we are working to achieve operational programmes for national minorities, protect and promote minority rights despite their increasingly loud questioning of individual actors, initiatives that seek to reduce minority rights undermine the democratic standards reached and that is what we are opposed as Government. On this trail, I will present today's report through four thematic areas: strengthening the rule of law, a more competitive economy and more balanced development, protection of family, tolerance and justice, and stronger and safer Croatia in Europe and the world. As a member of the EU, Croatia is part of a family of free European nations sharing common values among which the government is the first of the fundamentals. However, we also witness negative phenomena that indicate that there is still much work ahead of us to really strengthen our institutions. The state cannot be the right to support citizens if its institutions are not effective, responsible and all available. We must make additional efforts in the professionalisation of public services and state institutions in order to ensure a quick and effective service for all our citizens, full confidence in the state institutions and their legal behaviour. This is why the strength of Croatian institutions is our key, permanent and joint task. In the judiciary for many years, we have a continuous reduction in the number of pending cases in courts. In June 2016 there were 528 000 pending cases, and two years later the number was 424 000. So the number of pending cases has been reduced by 20% or you're down 104,000. Despite significant developments in the Croatian judiciary, however, the situation is still not satisfactory. By respecting the independence of the judiciary, we want to make the courts and the state's attorneys more effective and faster procedures, better equipment and more efficient organisation. The adoption of 6 judicial laws has enabled the reorganisation of a network of judicial authorities and better availability of courts. One of the main elements of this reorganisation was the merger of infringements with municipal courts, while at the same time the number of judicial authorities was further reduced from 116 to 108. Modernize and digitize the judiciary by spreading e-communication. In addition to the effectiveness of the judiciary, we addressed issues of transparency, accountability and independence of the judicial system through legislative amendments. This is how we introduced a transparent system of property cards that will be made publicly available from next year. We have adopted new solutions that will narrow the area for arbitration and allow for the selection of the best candidates for judicial duties. At the same time, we also prepared a proposal for a law on the protection of applicants of irregularities, so-called whistles to further protect those who report corruption and other irregularities in good faith. Such protection should always be given to journalists who play an important role because media freedom is an important component of democratic society. All of these are measures that we want to counter the existing corrupt risks and thus strengthen citizens' confidence in judicial institutions. Unfortunately, events related to the compromise of secret reconnaissances and the granting of special measures have further violated confidence in the system. I stress that the independence of the judiciary is manifested by not interfering with the work of the judicial authorities and by respecting their decisions, however, I expect, and this is also the view of the whole public, that judicial institutions are knowingly, effectively and responsibly exercising their powers in the fight against crime without political pressure, but with the full support of this government. I would like to make it clear that no one can be in Croatia and will be above the law. The bureaucratized public administration gradually, but surely goes into history. We connect or abolish more than 50 agencies with public powers, which saves or improves the system of public administration. We are building an efficient and digitized administration that is at the service of the citizens. A united IT infrastructure is established for all state electronic services. Through the system, 610 000 registered users can be associated with the doctor of general practice, report the birth of a child, obtain a unique building act, driver's license and use a total of 52 e services which saves both time and money. There's a cell phone app in preparation to bring it all together. With the law on units of local and regional self-government, we have ensured the stability of democratically elected authorities for 4 years so that local development priorities are focused. The units of local and regional self-government have missed income from income tax, which has given them financial strength and continued fiscal decentralisation. For too long, the untapped potential of state property is being put into operation today by more than 1950 decisions that have reactivated state property. We decentralized the management by transferring property management powers to the districts, cities and municipalities and putting them in the service of the economic development of local communities. We also promote the management of companies owned by the state on high corporate governance standards. Ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to creating a more competitive economy and more even development, I want to remind you of where we started and what macro economic indicators were not long ago. Due to major financial imbalances, the deficit of 17 billion 2014 and the public debt that reached 85% of GDP, Croatia was in the excessive budget deficit procedure by 2017, all indicators were negative and recovery was not in sight. However, the responsible management of finances, the implementation of the National Reform Programme and the Convergence Programme have turned this around. We are rapidly reducing the public debt whose share of GDP was due to fall to 74.5% by the end of the year, and we plan to bring it down to 65% by 2021. In 2017 we achieved a surplus of two billion and 750 million kuna in the general state, and in the first 6 months of 2018 again we have a surplus of more than one billion and 600 million kuna. GDP continues to grow at a rate of up to 3%, but on a healthy basis, which is better in the long term than a higher debt-based growth rate. Exports of goods and services are growing by 5.6% compared to the same period last year as household consumption grew at 3.6%. For many years Croatia has also been in the process of excessive macroeconomic imbalances, and given the results and plans we want to meet the criteria to get out of this procedure as soon as possible. We put the interest on public debt from 12 to below 10 billion kuna and we continue in that direction, and the reduction is also interest on loans to citizens and businesses. We have refinanced the unfavourable loans of road companies, saving on interest rates of 50 million euros annually. While our credit rating was reduced twice between 2012 and 2015 last year, all three leading global rating agencies improved the outlook of our credit rating. .../ The speaker doesn't understand. They have raised our credit rating by one level in stable odds, which is the first time in 15 years. Today we are one step to the investment rating, which is our goal in the next period. We have simplified the tax system, the reform we have been implementing since January 2017, and we have taxed out citizens and entrepreneurs. The tax burden we try more evenly to deploy to all taxpayers in order for the system to be more stable and fairer. The two most significant new measures that will further disburse citizens from the new year are the halving of VAT rates on fresh meat, fish, eggs, fruit, vegetables, baby diapers, and a new reduction in wage burden. These measures will disburse citizens and entrepreneurs by €2.7 billion, while the total tax disbursement in all 3 rounds of tax reform amounts to as much as €6.3 billion. We're also working on a key employment issue. In the past year alone, the number of employees increased by 71,000 and in the first quarter was one million and 616 thousand, and Croatia recorded one of the highest increases in the employment rate in the EU. With 56.8 at the beginning of the term of office, this quarter could reach 63%, and by the end of the term of office we want to realise our objective of 68% of employees. We still have 130,000 unemployed, but that number is the smallest since the '90s. A year and incomparably less than 350,000 as many as we had unemployed just 4 years ago. At the beginning of our term of office, the overall unemployment rate was 13.4%, and today it is at a record level of 7.9. We reduced the rate of youth unemployment, which was around 49% in 2013, and today it is to 22% and continues to fall. We invested 4.5 billion kuna in employment policies in the first two years of the mandate, most of which are from the European Social Fund, which stimulates the creation of new jobs. One of them is the desired project, which employs more than 7,000 women in rural areas, who care for 35,000 nursing homes. That's how we reactivate the workforce, but we also care for our older citizens. The average salary in the government's mandate increased by 710 kn. We also increased the minimum wages 2 times 5%, which is more than in the previous 9 years between 2011 and 2015, increased by only 215 kn, and in 2018 alone was effectively increased by 8.2%, i.e. by 270 kn to 3545 gross kn, as since this year overtime and work on Sundays and holidays no longer enters the minimum wage, but is paid additionally. By law on the procedure of extraordinary management in companies, of systemic importance, we avoided the negative consequences of which the breakdown of Agrokora could have caused the economy of Croatia, but also of countries in the region and thus saved 60,000 jobs. The law, meanwhile, has been recognised as one of the EU's insolvent laws, as well as before courts in England, Switzerland and the United States. By stabilising the business of Agrokora, we also removed the unfair commercial bangs, which were choked by small and medium suppliers. It is a structural change for the entire Croatian economy. With a successful settlement, it has proved that the state is capable of responding to the biggest challenge of Croatian independence, which is the stabilisation of this largest Croatian company, and that we are able to manage the complex process, the current largest restructuring in Europe. It is important to point out once again that all payments made by suppliers and the total cost of restructuring the collapsed business have been settled from the business of the company itself, without spending taxpayers' money. Shipbuilding, one of Croatia's major industrial branches, faces problems accumulated during the past years in the late 1980s. Croatia's shipbuilding production was 3 in the world, today we are in 9 positions globally, i.e. the second in European terms. However, it is true that Croatia has shared about 31.7 billion kuna with the shipyards, state aid in the last 25 years and the guarantee of the government of 716 million kn in January enabled the functioning of the Oilic and 3.May practically this entire calendar year. This government is interested in the Croatian shipbuilding to survive, but, on the principles of the market economy, in accordance with Croatian and European regulations. It is therefore necessary to find a restructuring model in cooperation with shipbuilding administrations, potential strategic partners and the European Commission, which will enable sustainable business and production and preserve jobs. On this day-to-day government representatives hold talks, including today, while we are here at the Croatian Parliament. The issue of reforming the pension system is a burning issue, which has not been resolved for years, although the situation has been increasingly serious. Of the 38 billion kuna needed to pay off pensions, only 21 billion are covered by contributions. The remaining 17 billion is compensated from the state budget. The fact that 15% of the budget goes to pensions shows that the system today is not just sustainable. To make things more complicated, we have an extremely unfavourable ratio of pensioners and employees, one, to just 1.26 and our pensioners on average have only 30 years of work experience, unlike 38 in Germany. In such circumstances as pension reform, we want to allow current pensioners to work for 4 hours, and receive full pension. We propose to increase the lowest pensions by 3% and a solution to the status of 248 thousand pensioners who, if nothing is done, will have no minimum pension. We open our perspective to younger generations through the strengthening of the second pillar, we promote the third voluntary pillar and we set up a state pension insurance company so that our pensioners have bigger pensions. We promised to raise our pensions by 5% and in the first two years of our term of office we already increased them by 6.3%. By the end of the term of office, we will be working to make the pension system more sustainable and fair and continue to increase pensions. In the global conditions of the fourth industrial revolution, there are 4 words that mean a lot to Croatia: competitiveness, innovation, digitalisation and investment. Competitive entrepreneurship and innovation are the key to economic growth which, unfortunately, the administration and the lack of efficiency of the administration seem to be barriers. Since the start of the mandate, we have been actively working on dissolving the economy and creating a positive investment climate that will contribute to economic growth. Only in this year will we save the economy 625 million kuna, reducing the burden by 12% and new administrative discharge by the end of 2019 will reduce the burden on entrepreneurs by 30%. Public procurement process is more efficient and transparent. Not only is the lowest bid chosen but the most economically profitable one. And we're introducing an electronic public procurement account that will speed up business processes. Better regulations and assessment of the impact of regulations on small and medium-sized enterprises have made it easier to operate, introduce greater flexibility and transparency, cheaper procedures, increase legal certainty and ensure more quality competition. We are uniting inspection services into a state inspectorate to ensure better coordination and to reduce the number of inspections. We will establish a full procurement procedure without paper, which will save up to 6 to 13% of the total amount of public procurement, or from more than 2.6 billion kuna. Our goal is to save time through the Digital Tansformation Strategy and the introduction of different e-services to entrepreneurs and facilitate their business. We will also improve craftsmanship by amending and supplementing the Law on crafts and improving the system of education on the principle of dual education. Investments play an important role in the development of the country, in 2017 we attracted 1.84 billion euros in investment, not yet in 2009, but in 2018 it will be recordable with as much as 2 billion euros in foreign investment as never reached the annual amount. These include a number of investments in tourism, information communication technologies, production and transport infrastructure. Easier applications over the last 2 years, we have granted almost 1800 support to an economy worth 2.7 billion kuna that should open or preserve more than 8,000 jobs. For our government, even regional development of all areas of the homeland is extremely important. We cannot be satisfied that the average income per capita of a Slavonec 2x is less than one Zagrebian. Therefore, strong support for less developed areas is one of the priorities of the government. We increased the expenditure on regional development in the current and last year to 700 million kuna, which is 3x more than in 2012/23015. We have established a clear legal framework to promote even development, and in the regional development strategy we are preparing a comprehensive national development strategy by the end of the programming period by 2030. We set up a framework for faster development of assisted areas, mountain-mounted areas, islands, the city of Vukovar as well as housing in assisted areas. We are making EU funds easier and better. After the first three years of EU membership in late 2016, we found only 9% of the agreed funds of 10.7 billion euros available to us. That information speaks for itself. With dedicated work in the last two years, we've raised that number to 54% today and by the end of the year we should reach 60%. Only for employment, social inclusion, education and public administration reform have we announced competitions from the European Social Fund in the amount of as much as 9 billion kuna. We have launched and are making concrete efforts under the Project Slavonia, Baranja and Srijem through which 18.8 billion kunas from European funds are being invested in projects in 5 Slavonian counties and we are establishing priorities for the development of eastern Croatia. Demographic challenges and weaker economic growth in Slavonia are trying to make up for the 7.8 billion kuna agreed so far, i.e. 42% of the estimated amount and the 5 County Development Agreement for Slavonia, Baranja and Srijem was signed. We believe that the project will be a successful model for investment in other parts of Croatia. We connect Croatia and build transport infrastructure. From the EU alone, we have agreed 14 billion kunas of infrastructure investment. With a decision to build a Pelje Bridge with 85% co-financing from EU funds, we will end traffic jams and after 300 years of territorial separation we will connect the south of Croatia. In addition to financial, we continue with operational restructuring in road companies. As a Mediterranean maritime state, we are strategically developing the maritime sector, maritime well-being and ports. For the first time, we have created conditions for European financing of projects for the development of port infrastructure. After the shift in the road and maritime sectors, it is time to modernise the rail infrastructure that is in poor condition and make railways competitive for the transport of passengers and goods. That's why we started a big investment cycle of over 3 billion euros by 2030. Without new investment, there is no development of railways as the most economically and environmentally favourable land transport. After steaming machine, electricity and electronics are under way, the fourth industrial revolution is based on digitization, Internet stuff, artificial intelligence, nano, bio and neuro technologies. The world we enter in just a few years will be completely different from the present. Croatia must also prepare for this by integration into the EU's digital market and at national level. By means of a national broadband plan, we program the construction of infrastructure for more uniform introduction of new technologies and availability of fast internet across Croatia. I am therefore particularly pleased that the Ericsson Research Centre Nikola Tesla is open in Osijek, which thus becomes one of the European IT centres. With growing energy needs, the issue of energy security is now taking on a growing geopolitical dimension. In order to ensure the security of supply and energy independence of Croatia over the last 2 years, we are working intensively to prepare the project LNG terminal on the island of Krk, while respecting the highest ecological standards. The special law we have passed will help to complete the project successfully, we are rebuilding more than 600 public buildings throughout Croatia, and from next year we are subsidising reconstruction and private houses to boost energy efficiency and the construction sector. In the next two years, we'll use 5 billion kuna for that. The development of Croatian villages and agriculture as an important component of economic development is one of the government's top priorities. In order to raise the competitiveness of Croatian farmers and fishermen and to improve the development of our rural areas last year, more than 4 and a half billion kuna of support has been paid, and this year, in the framework of the rural development programme, 9.4 billion have already been agreed. We have simplified and shortened the procedures in achieving support for key legislation on agricultural land, on the family holding and banning unfair commercial practices in the food supply chain, reforming the agricultural sector. As promised, marine fisheries and aquaculture have gained the status of strategic economic activities. We have facilitated the financing of the agricultural, processing and forestry sectors with a billion kuna loans and guarantees. We remain focused on family farms which we want to ensure that money from European funds is more available. With an average of over 390kg of waste per capita, it is crucial to establish a modern waste management system that creates resources from waste. This will protect our environment, but also make great savings. We are therefore working on the development of a circular economy, on increasing energy security and efficiency, as well as on the efficiency of water utility economies. This also contributes to the global fight against climate change that we all need to be involved in. A special law has been passed that enables us to manage water integratedly and to preserve our national water resources better. With a capital protection project against the project of the Karlovo-Sikas end with 92km of new embankments and reconstructions of 42km of existing ones, we will reduce the risks of floods. Tourism is an important economic branch that makes up a fifth of Croatia's GDP. After a record 2017 we will experience an even better 2018. We already have 6% more arrivals and 4% more overnight stays. Compared to this period last year and a month earlier, we reached 100 million overnights. By the end of the year, we expect 19 and a half million arrivals, 106 million overnight stays and incomes above 12 billion euros. By the end of the year, we will invest almost a billion euros in tourism, which is 15% more than in 2017 and almost 40% more than in 2016. We strengthen Croatia's position as an aircraft destination leading to the opening of 70 new aircraft lines, making it more accessible to tourists from more distant countries. In today's fast changing world, education and science, public goods are particularly important for achieving personal, economic and social development. A necessary and long-awaited reform of education has begun to take place. We have provided legal framework and resources, and we intend to bring curricula documents based on the social consensus that will enable students to acquire new knowledge, skills and competences. Couriculums must simultaneously strengthen the identity of our children and our young people through the Croatian language of our values, our culture and history and prepare them for the needs of an increasingly dynamic and demanding labour market. We professionally analyse and value all the changes that we introduce into the system, digitize and technical equipment schools, and we have introduced IT into the 5th and 6th classes of OS as a mandatory subject, we have improved vocational education and have provided a billion kuna for vocational schools. 25 vocational schools were raised to the level of the regional centre of competence, meaning new equipment in vocational schools, entering the world of work students and teaching teachers. By the end of 2020, about 67,000 students will receive scholarships totalling half a billion kuna due to an unfavourable socio-economic position or for studies in the field. In order to improve Croatian science, 13 scientific centres of excellence have been established to allocate more than 370 million kuna. We created the necessary preconditions for the employment of 350 young scientists and thus for their stay in Croatia. We have secured a billion kunas for scientific equipment and infrastructure, which is the largest equipment of Croatian science in the last 15 years, and we have pulled as much as 2.8 billion kuna from the European funds. In the area of culture, the care of our cultural identity, the protection of heritage, the support of creativity in creative industries, the promotion of Croatian art culture in the country and the world and international cooperation are our permanent tasks. To this end, we have increased the budget of the Ministry of Culture, which is now almost 1% of the state budget, which has also contributed to better funding from the EU funds. We have adopted 3 whole laws: The Law on Audiovisual Activities to encourage investment in film production and export of film services including video games, a growing market with a package of the Law on Museums and Archives and Archive materials, we adapt to digital time and digitise archival construction and cultural heritage. Respected MPs and MPs, at the centre of the government's policy, there is the creation of a more solid and fairer society, and in particular the strengthening of the family as its fundamental units. Extremely negative demographic trends and aging are the problem throughout Europe and so is Croatia. In a continuing negative trend since World War II, the number of births fell from 95 to about 37,000 a year. While the death toll remained at 50 thousand, 37:50. In addition, we are a country with traditionally large eviction which further worsens the situation especially since the freedom of movement of Croatian citizens can be employed across EU member states. No more quotas, no more work permits, the only country that can protect its labour market for another two years from the arrival of Croatian citizens is Austria. All the others have completely liberalised their labour market and that is why this wave of emigration has been happening for the last few years. Realising that demographic restoration is crucial for Croatia's future, we have established within the current ministry and part that is extremely important for Croatia's future, which is demographics as well as a council for demographic revitalisation. We increased support for the birth of a child by 50% from 2663 to 3991 kuna for another 6 months and cash benefits for unemployed parents from 1663 to 2328 kuna per month. We have extended the circle of children's extras to 92 thousand parents and 150 thousand children, as well as the most intelligent 500 kuna supplement for 3rd and 4th child, which is an extension of 50% compared to the previous number of users and the first increase after decades. We build or restore over 300 kindergartens, and enable the two-way work of kindergartens in ever-increasing conditions. In order to strengthen young people and their families, we continue to subsidise housing loans and build apartments under the programme of socially encouraged housing throughout Croatia. Only last year, 2320 young families came to their home more favourably through a subsidisation measure, and we are especially pleased that 250 children were born in these families. Over 3,000 received requests this year show exceptional interest and impact of this measure. In cooperation with public and private sector partners, we plan to introduce a family card that will allow families with more children to benefit from progressive discounts according to the number of children on various services offered by partners. Our goal is also to strengthen return measures and action plans to facilitate Croatian emigrants' return or eviction to Croatia. However, we must bear in mind that demographic issues are one of the most complex and that there is no immediate solution in this area, but they move only in the medium and long term. This is a general social issue that requires joint engagement and only through general mobilization and awareness will we be able to reverse negative demographic trends. In this regard, particularly important are the young holders of the new development cycle in Croatia and the most dynamic part of society, we are aware of their problems and the uncertainty of the employment they are often offered. We finance youth projects with 6.3 million kuna to improve the dialogue on public policies for young people, and we also formed the Government's Youth Council. We want to create for young people conditions for a better life so they can stay here and build their future. In order to protect women's victims from violence and domestic violence, we ratified the Council of Europe Convention to combat domestic violence, respecting the Croatian constitutional order. And despite that campaign that we have witnessed, I would like to say that our interpretative statement, which is part of the Confirmation Act, has been accepted here in the Croatian Parliament among the legal experts of the Council of Europe, has not only been welcomed and accepted without even the slightest reservation but is considered as a model for other Member States to facilitate the ratification process of this Convention and that things return to its essence, which is preventing violence against women and domestic violence. Preventing family, peer and any other form of violence is a civilization issue. The government is determined to do everything in its power to combat the appropriate protection of victims as well as to punish the most severe perpetrator. Ensuring equally accessible and quality health services is one of the priorities of the Government programme as well as a particular challenge in the system that requires modernisation. To this end we are conducting a functional integration of 12 hospitals that will unite their work: Vinkovci, Vukovar, Ogulin, Karlovac, S. Brod, N. Gradiška, Osijek, Nasice, Sibenik, Knin, Požega, Pakrac. We are promoting the emergency care system through the functional integration of the county emergency medical services and the united emergency hospital reception. Over the priority waiting lists we have entered for diseases that need to be processed and treated as soon as possible during 2018, more than 14,000 patients have been ordered. And in health care, we make better use of European funds. So far, more than 3 billion kuna of health infrastructure projects, emergency health care and better hospital care have been agreed. The financial sustainability of the system contributes and a united public procurement process that we are carrying out. We supported the construction of a new KBC hospital in Rijeka, the construction of a general hospital in Pula, and we plan to build a National Children's Hospital. Doctors and other healthcare professionals are the foundation of a health system that requires support from the state. We finance more than 200 specialists in primary health care, a national cancer plan is being prepared, since cancer is the second cause of mortality in Croatia, we also develop anti-drug programmes. An important health prevention and anti-addiction factor is sport. Over the past year, we have increased the allocations for sport by 23%, and we have doubled the awards for top sports performances in the competitions. In addition to the joke of champions at the world football championship in Russia, Croatian athletes showed talent, tenacity and success on various world and European reviews, I congratulate them again. The first strategic document in the field of sports will improve its funding. We take care of the most vulnerable groups because caring for the most important tasks of every solidarity society, and over half a million of our citizens live with a certain type of disability. In the next 2 years, 15 000 people with disabilities will have personal assistance services thanks to the funds provided through the European Social Fund. After 20 years, personal disability and care allowance were increased by 20%. Thank you, sweethearts. Representatives and MPs, one of the problems we have encountered is a large number of blocked citizens. The number of 325 000 citizens in the blockade over 43 billion kunas of debt alone spoke of the acuteity of the long-standing social problem blocked to which we have approached responsibly. The principle of solidarity we have adopted a package of laws to address the issues blocked in order to give the most vulnerable citizens a hand of salvation and to allow a new start. We first spent a one-time write-off and thus unblocked 6248 citizens completely. Such treatment has also been decided by certain local units of the private company that we welcome, and we hope to set an example for others. Then we made it possible to suspend the verification of the performance that proved to be non-refundable. With these measures, with these two laws, the number of 325 000 blocked has been reduced to 274,000, and the amount of the blockade has been reduced from more than 43 billion kuna to less than 19 billion kuna. We also expect a significant contribution from a simpler consumer bankruptcy process that should include around 80,000 citizens. Cost reduction, additional protection of the perpetrators, introduction of electronic communication, more effective implementation of the procedure are the main objectives of the new executive law, including excluding the possibility of operations in the winter period, we additionally raise the amount of real estate from 20 to 40 000 kuna and we extend the cycle of receipts excluded from the performance. We are creating a more modern collection system that will ensure cheaper, faster and more effective settlement of the credentials with an increased level of protection of the perpetrators. The issue of the Homeland War and the issue of Croatian defenders is very important for the entire Croatian society, but also for our government. We therefore pay special attention to Croatian defenders who have made an immeasurable contribution for Croatian freedom, and have often been underrespected in the past years. That's why we strengthened our relationship with the Homeland War. With the protection of the dignity of the Homeland War, whose operations we honor with dignity, we show our respect for the role of Croatian defenders in defending the country, achieving its independence and liberation. In two years we increased the budget of the Croatian Defence Ministry by 50% and passed a new single law on Croatian defenders and members of their families, as promised. We also care about lighting up the fate of the missing and punishing the perpetrators of war crimes during the Homeland War that don't get old. At the beginning of the year, a special group was established at the government's initiative under the Police Directorate's task of intensifying activities on the painful issue, especially in connection with crimes committed in Vukovar and Ovcara. We have also launched the first expert and reasoned debate on dealing with the past. Through it we want to build a memory culture that respects victims, condemn totalitarian regimes and individualizes guilt. Investment in education on these topics will prevent revisionism, denial, relativisation and demeaning of victims of the 20th century non-democratic systems. Dear MPs and MPs, allow a few words about Croatia's role in Europe and the world. Transnational challenges, increased number and type of security threats today require country-wide adaptation and preventive action. Although, like many, we are faced with a variety of criminalities, Croatia is a globally secure country, and the overall crime in decline is by 5.2%, we are still investing in prevention and security for the daily fight of all criminal acts, especially in countering organised, economic and cybercrime. Entry into the Schengen area, the strategic goal of Croatia that will raise the level of protection of our borders. We want to meet all technical criteria by the end of the year to be ready to enter Schengen by 2020. The issue of migration is one of the main challenges facing Europe today. Croatia has the longest, out of the Schengen border of the EU and already has about 6 and a half thousand border police officers, almost as much as all Southeast European countries combined that protect Croatia's border from illegal migration. As we are on the only land-based migrant route, we must be prepared to protect our borders even more effectively. So we will continue to invest in improving labour standards and the lives of police officers, which, after many years of neglect, has been initiated by this government. We are building an OS on the tradition of a successful and victorious Croatian army on its wings to win the Homeland War, an increased defence budget that improves the ability of the Croatian military and raises the country's international credibility. After 15 years, the National Security Strategy and the National Security System Act have been adopted, we are developing an effective Homeland Security System for coordinated action by different actors in all the challenges of police, military, bodies and civil protection systems, security-intelligence systems, fire, diplomacy, economy and local communities. We returned the Croatian army to Sinj, Vukovar, Ploče, at the end of the year in Varazdin, through 2019 and 2020 in Pula, which increased the rate of reaction. We have also made a historic decision on the acquisition of a multi-purpose fighter F-16 from Israel, thus raising the readiness of the Croatian Air Force and ensuring the ability to control and protect the national airspace. We are constantly improving living standards, working conditions and education of members of the Croatian army to which we are returning the rights we have taken away. Three months ago. We marked the 5th anniversary of Croatia's EU membership. In the European Parliament and in front of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as I chair the Committee of Ministers as well as the Central European Initiative, I had the opportunity to present the Croatian vision of Europe, and then I pointed out that we wanted to be part of a circle of closer integrated members. We are working intensively to prepare for our EU presidency in the first half of 2020, preparing with Romania and Finland with which we form a trio. And this is our opportunity to contribute to the further development of the European project. Our Presidency priorities will be focused on growth, development, employment, energy and transport links, security and enlargement policy. We advocate the enlargement of the Union to JI Europe because we believe that European integration can only strengthen peace, stability and prosperity in this part of the world. 20 years after the Zagreb summit, it was in November 2000, Croatia wants to repeat such a meeting between EU and SEE leaders during the EU Council's Presidency in spring 2020. In the spring, Croatia will host a very important meeting at the top of China +16. A part of the Chinese policy of one belt one time will be attended by the Chinese prime minister and the leaders of 16 Central European countries and we expect more than 2,000 participants. After a recent meeting with Chancellor Merkel in Berlin, next week I will be in Paris with President France Macron, and this is the occasion that in such short time with the two most influential European states, we will jointly consider the direction and the breaking moments that will take place for the EU in the next year. Also, I will visit China in early November to prepare and strengthen our co-operation together before the summit next year. Dear MPs and MPs, I also want to look back today on BiH with which we have very strong and close ties, in which Croats as an equal and constitutive people of BiH play a special role. We see that in Sunday's elections, it has been derailed for the third time by the very meaning of the Dayton Agreement, which is the fundamental principle of equality between the constituent peoples and which was also a prerequisite for BiH's international recognition, has been violated. As a guarantee and a signator of the Danton-Paris Treaty, Croatia is obliged to protect its spirit and its objectives. The results show that the orchestrated action played the real political will of the Croatian people in BiH, which they elected on Sunday by Bosniaks to the territory of the Federation as a single electoral unit, Zeljko Komsic, for the third time for the nominal representative in the presidency. Despite the plebiscite support for Dragan Covic. What happened was bad for the stability and future of all BiH because it unnecessarily antagonises Croats and Bosniaks. In 1992, Croats voted in favour of BiH's independence, defending it against Milosevic's aggression in a referendum. Today, it is those who draw the most towards the EU, with strong support from the consensus of all political actors in the Republic of Croatia, and in turn send a message in return that their legitimate representatives are not welcome in the largest institution in power. The situation is a key challenge for the Croats in BiH as well as for Croatia to point out the necessity of correcting such abuses to political actors in BiH as well as to the entire international community. When it comes to Slovenia, we continued the dialogue on resolving the border issue. We have offered a solution that is in the mutual interest and we remain ready in good neighbourly spirit with the new Slovenian government to resolve the issue bilaterally. Relations with Serbia are burdened not only with open issues from the time of isolation and aggression against the Republic of Croatia, such as the issues of missing, cultural goods, the regional jurisdiction of the Serbian law, but also with rhetoric that Croatia rarely distills in the international community, which we firmly answer in all international forums. Despite the war being imposed, Croatia has won and today is a member of the EU and NATO, it is important that Serbia and its leadership take this into account and adopt European values as soon as possible. We take care of Croats outside Croatia, who want to connect with the country, but also provide them with protection in other countries, where they are minority, based on the principle of reciprocity and respect for signed contracts. Dear MPs and MPs, after half the term of office of this government, I believe it is necessary to awaken optimism, confidence and trust in society. And to unite people around common values, to give pain to common success, protect national interests and strengthen our position in Europe and the world. In the end, I want to point out a few priorities in the time ahead. First, we will continue to strengthen the rule of law and strengthen the independence and efficiency of judicial institutions. We will not hesitate to combat abuse and strengthen efficiency. This is why we continue to digitise public services more rapidly, and the second we will step up the measures of demographic revitalisation. The state must support every family to decide on the number of children they really want. We will subsidise the settlement of the housing issue, provide appropriate monetary and logistics support to parents, introduce, as I highlighted the family card and devise additional measures to attract Croats living outside Croatia in the country. On the economic side, we will further reduce the administrative and tax burden, the economy and the citizens, which will lead to the creation of new jobs and investments. Entrepreneurs, and especially exporters, are the drivers of Croatia and therefore we will facilitate their business, so that they can raise salaries to workers and employees more easily. By the end of the term of office, we will be responsible for leading public finances, reducing public debt and reaching investment ratings, which was unimaginable about 2 years ago, and we will make better use of EU membership, work on entering the Schengen area and implementing the euro introduction strategy as an official currency in co-operation with the CNB. We will address the improved absorption of European funds and prepare the Presidency of the EU Council, based on the National Reform Programme, to implement a series of sectoral reforms. First of all, the reform of the three largest state systems, for which our citizens are most interested, because of their scale and importance. Peacekeeping, health and education. We will complete strategic infrastructure implementations, such as LNG terminals on Krk and Pelješki bridge, and we will prepare a great modernisation of Croatian railways. Due to the importance of Croatia's connection and value to co-finance 2.7 billion kn, when built for 3 years, the Pelješki bridge will be the most tangible symbol of Croatian membership in the EU. Each of the measures on which we work daily should improve certain aspects of the lives of our citizens, but as a whole, indeed, should change Croatia and bring the vision of a successful and modern state, which adapts very quickly by changing global circumstances. And in the past experience, we know that this job has been very demanding, but it has been more demanding and even more difficult to fight for independence, for international recognition, to defeat the superior aggressor in the Homeland War, to free and restore the country, to meet the criteria for EU and NATO membership, it has been even more demanding. That's why we won't save effort or energy. And I am convinced that we can succeed, so I invite both representatives and representatives of the Croatian Parliament, but also the entire Croatian public to join us in changing Croatia for the better. Thank you very much.""]","<|system|>

Ladies and gentlemen, we are only a few hours away from the forty days of confinement since we have activated one of the strictest alarm states in the world in Spain. A true quarantine that we never thought we would live and that Spanish society has had to face with courage, resistance and exemplary discipline, with a moral of victory. We are living in a time of extraordinary personal sacrifices, also of social sacrifices and economic sacrifices, which have just begun, because the global public health crisis initiated by COVID-19 will not be over until science finds a vaccine. Meanwhile, all governments in all institutions, in all corners of the planet, must continue to work to contain the spread of the virus, while preparing to enter a new normality. There have been positive trends in Spain for days that indicate that we are doubling the contagion curve. We have overcome, as the Minister of Health has said in various appearances, the critical moment of the spread of the virus; our health system has resisted, and the number of recoveries - which today totals more than 82,000 people - is a reason for hope. But, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot lower our guard, even if our health system begins to decongest - as it is doing - and the materials and tests are coming - as they are already doing in greater quantities - every lost life reminds us of the solemn obligation to continue working tirelessly to offer one morning to all Spaniards and Spaniards. Those stolen lives have filled with pain the homes of thousands of families who will never forget the brutality of this health crisis. I want to assure you here again, in the House of Popular Sovereignty, that Spanish society will neither forget it nor forget its dead, they all deserve our tribute and will have it; they all deserve our remembrance and will have it, moreover, with the breadth and solemnity they deserve. Ladies and gentlemen, I appear today at the Congress of Deputies for two reasons, as the President of the Congress has said. Firstly, in order to request the further extension of the state of alarm, which will allow us to enter progressively and sensibly into the next phase, the phase of descalation, and secondly, to account for the work that the Government of Spain is doing within the framework of the European Union in various European councils that have been developing during this beginning of the year. I begin with the first point, the object of the motive that has brought us here. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to ask that all the parliamentary forces - or at least most of the parliamentary forces present here - support the Royal Decree extending the state of alarm adopted by the Government of Spain at the last Council of Ministers held yesterday. This is the third time I have asked as President of the Government for this extension, but this is the first time that I can do it with a prudent future scenario - and I stress this word, cautiously - optimistic. Citizenship has resisted the disciplined confinement charged with growing longings and certainly also, let us recognize it, with uncertainty. All of Spain has reinvented itself in this week, has learned to live in waiting, in the absence of certainties, in the enclosure. For the first time since this terrible emergency began, I am today asking for an extension of the state of alarm by seeing what life could be like, once the acute phase of the crisis has passed. As I announced, ladies and gentlemen, last Saturday - and I also treated the presidents and autonomous presidents and the mayors represented in the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces, and without a doubt also the leaders of the majority of the political parties - we were able to start designing the next scenario that is the stage of the descalada. I consider it essential to extend the state of alarm because we have to be extremely cautious at this stage. In a situation of extreme gravity, such as the one we live in - and I say it now - it is obvious that any optimism must be accompanied by prudence, the necessary and the essential prudence. Therefore, by following the advice of the World Health Organization and from the Government of Spain with the advice of various scientists, from the Government we will be extremely cautious and cautious in the so-called phase of descalation. As you know, WHO, the World Health Organization, has recommended the six guidelines that a country must bring together to lift the confinement. And I would like to share them with all of you, at least so that it is recorded in the Congressional Journal of Sessions. Firstly, transmission will have to be controlled and identified for infected persons. We are moving in the right direction - in my opinion - to achieve this in each and every territory of our country. Secondly, the National Health System should be able to detect by test each case of infection that appears so that it is immediately isolated and to warn people to whom it may have infected. Ladies and gentlemen, we have already carried out a million PCR tests, which are most likely, and we have provided two million rapid tests to the autonomous communities to develop them in those places where there can be a potential contagion, such as hospitals and also the residences of older people, as you all know. Thirdly, we must have under full control places with the highest risk of infection and maximum vulnerability, i.e. health facilities and new residences for older people. Fourthly, a system of control of people from other areas will have to be put in place to prevent new imported infections, we are already doing so and we will continue to do so over the next few weeks, not only at national level but also at European and international level. Fifthly, we must - we are told by the WHO - establish strict preventive measures in workplaces and also in educational establishments, and we are achieving this by the hands of the social partners and also of the autonomous communities in many of these areas. And sixthly, the population must have complete information and we must all be committed to the rules of hygiene and social distancing. I believe that we are doing this on a permanent basis and the commitment of all citizens is - I insist - even exemplary. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain will follow the approach of the WHO and the experts, as we have done since the beginning of the crisis, and with much more reason at this stage in which we risk the achievements that we have all achieved so hard. The general confinement will not rise until we are truly prepared for it, because we are not going to run any risk that will bring us back to the painful situation that we have experienced and that has cost us all so much to reverse. This extension of the state of alarm, ladies and gentlemen, will not be the same as the previous ones. Legal coverage will be the same, the state of alarm provided for in our Constitution, but the rules and scope will vary in the same way as the situation has changed. Therefore, over the coming weeks, and having in the second half of May the horizon of descalation or the second phase of the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, the rules and limitations will have to vary in order to adjust to these new scenarios. Progressively, ladies and gentlemen, the danger will be reduced and, according to that reduction, the conditions of the state of alarm will be changed, always - I insist - with the same premise: to protect the citizenry and to keep our health system safe so that the descalation can be carried out gradually and safely. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we should all assume that the descalation is going to be slow and gradual, precisely because it must be safe. Every improvement in the health system and every check of the control of the contagions will allow us a new advance in the liberation of spaces of mobility and social activity. Ladies and gentlemen, we must avoid to the extent of our possibilities, and with all the uncertainty that logically you have to face a virus that is still unknown to science as to its remedy, the wrong steps. That is why, after every new breakthrough, we have to make sure of its solidity before taking a new step. If we keep the virus at bay and our health system maintains and strengthens the tone, we will pose a new step, and if not, we will stop, if we warn of any risk, we will re-establish the restrictions. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, there will be no final decisions, but there will be progress and setbacks depending on the behaviour of the virus against those decisions that we are taking. Ladies and gentlemen, this extension of the alarm decree includes two very important amendments that I would like to share with all of you. The first is that which will alleviate the confinement of minors, boys and girls, and thus facilitate the day-to-day life of their parents. And the second is that the royal decree enables the Ministry of Health with new powers. On the first point, this is a government that listens, ladies and gentlemen, and that is why we are proposing relief from the confinement of minors. It is true that we sin with prudence; our sons and daughters are all. The scientific committee that advises the Government, as well as the experts in pediatrics and child psychology, have asked us to do so with the utmost caution, and after the discussions of the health authorities and children's authorities, minors will be able to take controlled walks. On these grounds, from next Sunday, 26 April, the date of the start of the new extension, we propose to allow minors aged fourteen to accompany an adult responsible for their care when he carries out some activity allowed during the state of alarm and for the walks of minors will be approved an order, under the authorization that the Ministry of Health has conferred by the royal decree of the state of alarm, as already yesterday the Minister of Health made public before Spanish society. Ladies and gentlemen, the Government is aware of the tremendous effort that confinement has made for children and for parents, for families in our country. I repeat that this exception, this small relief - because it is a small relief - which implies the possibility of children leaving, does not alter the most important, which is the rule of general confinement that continues in force. With regard to the second point of the change in the state of alarm, which seems to me to be the most substantive from the point of view of substance and horizon that we have during the next two weeks of work, I would like to inform you that this royal decree of extension is different from the previous ones and it is because this royal decree will allow us to begin to derail the rules of confinement. Therefore, what the Government proposes in this amendment that we bring to its debate and vote is to empower the Ministry of Health to modify, expand, restrict, allow measures, places, establishments and commercial, cultural and recreational activities. And I think it is very important to underline the verbs that I incorporate in my speech, and also logically in the text that you have to put to the vote: it empowers the Ministry of Health to modify, to extend, to restrict the measures, the places, the establishments and the commercial, cultural and recreational activities allowed. That is, ladies and gentlemen, we are going to take steps forward and we are going to take steps backwards, depending on how the pandemic, the epidemic, is going on in each of the territories. The Ministry of Health is also empowered to issue orders and instructions determining the scope and territorial scope of other activities and movements already permitted. This is an essential legal tool that will help us to move forward in the different stages that will make up the transition to this new normality, once we have defeated the virus. In that transition we are already counting on the autonomous communities, as we have also been doing with the social actors, and in this case we met with the autonomous governments on Monday precisely to start building this strategy of descalation. We are in the right direction, ladies and gentlemen, so that we can embark on this process of de-escalation when it touches with the best coordination between the various administrations. I also think it is very important to stress, ladies and gentlemen, that the municipalities and the provinces are going to play a decisive role in this transition to this new normality. Why? Because the territorial units, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the action of this decontainment or de-escalation is concerned will most likely be inferior to what the autonomous governments represent administratively. Ladies and gentlemen, when I obtained the investiture as President of the Government, just a few days before the pandemic reached Spain, I expressed the goals that I wanted for our country and that I am sure it shares a large majority of Spanish society regardless of who votes in the various elections. First, growth - I said - based on knowledge and increased productivity. Secondly, a leap forward in the incorporation of Spain and society as a whole into the technological revolution in all areas of our society. Thirdly, an ecological transition to more sustainable and logical modes of production that must preserve the environment, in addition to ensuring justice in this ecological transition. Fourthly, a strong welfare state - I think it is very important to draw this conclusion after what we are experiencing - which dispenses social justice and protects everyone, especially the weakest. And finally, full equality between men and women, as well as a country capable of living together in the difference. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe that these goals devoid of any partisan spirit remain fully effective following the health, economic and social crisis to which we have been subjected. I believe that it should be a source of satisfaction for all to have succeeded in bringing the vast majority of political forces into the arrangement to form agreements for the social and economic reconstruction of our country. For the first time after many years the political forces with parliamentary representation - at least for the most part - will meet at a table to dialogue, to contrast, to start designing a future scenario of common work, unity and strength, dialogue and solidarity. I believe that this is a step that the vast majority of citizens long for, and I will also say that it needs our country. That is why it is synonymous with hope for our Government. The Government has already said, and reiterates it today, that the protagonist of these pacts is collective and that if they include a success there will be only one winner, and it is precisely the whole of the citizenry. In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank here and now all the parties that have said yes to this table for the social and economic reconstruction, to the autonomous governments that have also said yes to that desire for an interinstitutional agreement for the social and economic reconstruction, and without a doubt also to the municipalities and social actors that have accepted the challenge of putting us to seek among all that unites us and to park the differences that logically separate us, of making effective the interest of all Spanish citizens above any partisan strategy that seeks the particular benefit at the expense of the rest. We are going to lay the foundations for an agreement with a view to the future, and I sincerely believe that this is the best we can offer our country. I believe that from this dialogue, which is going to be intense and complex, but also complete and profound, there will be an encouraging future; an encouraging future must emerge. It will lay the foundations for a new way of governing and a new way of doing politics. Before I said that all of Spain was reinventing itself; it has reinvented its everyday life, its way of organizing itself, its way of surviving and also of resisting. So the time has come for politics to live up to the citizenry, the time has come for new political ways. When we have enough perspective, ladies and gentlemen, we will surely see that this global emergency has the effect of accelerating changes, which have already been under way for years: the shift to new forms of non-invasive work, with the spread of telework; the shift to forms of production and consumption compatible with the response to the climate emergency; the accelerated shift to digitisation and automation, where we are seeing, for example, the digital divide and the effects it is having on education, particularly on public education; the shift to forms of global governance to deal with threats that are also global, such as this pandemic. But a global shock has come that has accelerated all these changes that we have been recording and debating in this House, in this forum, for a long time, and I believe that one of the most important changes awaiting us is the change in policy towards forms of dialogue and cooperation that replace sterile dialectics of blockade and confrontation. The thought that a plural country needs plural work and a will for union is an idea that has opened itself up in these weeks, let us recognize it, with great strength. This, ladies and gentlemen, as we said at the beginning of the investiture, is the legislature of dialogue, it must be the legislature of dialogue; I repeated it later and I maintain it, ladies and gentlemen. There will be no better or more pressing opportunity to put into effect that unique will that has the whole of the Spanish dialogue society than this moment so critical, so transcendental for the history of Spain and also of Europe. I believe that this is the case for all of us, and we are going to demonstrate it in the work for this social and economic reconstruction agreement that will take place in this very House. On several occasions I have stated, ladies and gentlemen, inside and outside this House that I was asking the political forces for unity and loyalty, that I was asking for exactly what I was willing to offer. No one in good faith discusses the need for social and economic reconstruction agreements to re-establish our country, especially in view of the economic prospects presented by various international bodies. On the other hand, there are those who doubt the sincerity of the proposal, because they believe that it is the Government that could benefit from these agreements. Well, I want to offer two guarantees against those reservations today. First of all, I wish to solemnly proclaim that the culmination of an agreement will be a success for all those who bow their shoulders and thus contribute to understanding; reconstruction pacts cannot be patrimonialized by anyone. Secondly, the need for social and economic reconstruction is a pressure that is not expressed only at national level, it does not challenge this House alone. The economic and social devastation caused by this crisis will manifest itself in all the spaces of our geography and of our Administration, which is one of the most decentralized in the world, in particular in a face as capital as that of our National Health System. That is why I express my support for the achievement of reconstruction pacts at the different stages of our geography. I repeat: I express my support for the achievement of reconstruction pacts at the different stages of our geography. These reconstruction agreements must incorporate that spirit of unity and common work in each autonomous community, in each municipality, the governing authority. Therefore, yes to the reconstruction agreements, with all their consequences, without reservation, in each place, in each administration, governs who governs, without more exclusion than those of those who self-exclude and decide to stay out of the social and economic recovery of our country. Ladies and gentlemen, the working space for the agreements to be successful must be confined to matters which may lead to an agreement and must set aside those which cause controversy. First of all, I think it is clear that we need to talk about our National Health System. We must rebuild it, we must strengthen it, because it is not only the defense that protects us all as individuals, but it is what defends us as a community against attacks and threats like the ones we are suffering. Secondly, it is essential to revitalize the pulse of our economy. It is necessary to agree on the precise financial, fiscal and administrative measures to rebuild and relaunch the business fabric devastated by this pandemic, to restore power and dynamism to all sectors affected, focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, the social economy and self-employment, which suffer from a much more peremptory weakness because of their size. The whole social economy of our country must be re-launched and sectors that have been hit hard, such as industry, tourism, hospitality and culture, must be given greater priority. Thirdly, it is essential to take social protection measures, so that absolutely no one is abandoned or unprotected in a crisis or in a trance like this, or when the social and economic crisis takes over from the health crisis. Finally, it is essential that in this new way of making policy we have as a priority to be in line with the European agreements, which we offer and demand within, we can offer and demand outside. Ladies and gentlemen, the pacts in Spain will be the pacts in Europe: union and solidarity, the capacity to work together, the real possibility of sustaining freedom and democracy, of leaving no one behind, ultimately. That is the new policy that awaits us, that is the new policy to which the Government appeals, that is the future for which we are going to work and fight together and together in Spain and Europe. At this point, I will inform you of the results of the various extraordinary European Councils on 20 and 21 February and of the ordinary European Council held on 26 March. On the European Council of 20 and 21 February, a Council was proposed by the President, Charles Michel, as an opportunity to reach agreement on the multiannual financial framework, which was anticipated to be very complicated from the beginning. As you know, at last December's meeting there was no agreement on the proposal which the Commission first presented, and then the Presidency of the European Union, the Finnish Presidency. Both were insufficient for the Spanish objectives in the area of the common agricultural policy and also cohesion policy. We therefore call on the President-in-Office of the Council to present a new proposal with an approach to positions, which led to this proposal being presented on 14 February and which formed the basis for the negotiation of the extraordinary European Council that brings us here today. Before that meeting, ladies and gentlemen, we said that the new proposal seemed just as disappointing to us as the previous one, because it still did not reflect the approaches of many countries, including our own, and that did not favour consensus. The final result is already known, there was no agreement, and the President of the Council acknowledged that we needed more time to negotiate. The Spanish position was and will continue to be the defence of Spain's interests in Europe, of a Europe that has to be strong and solidary. We have the support of a large number of partners, articulated under the umbrella of the group of countries for a more ambitious Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, it has barely been eight weeks since that meeting - eight weeks - and today when I told you this, I am convinced that you thought it had happened years ago. The world we lived in has suddenly changed. However, what the Spanish Government had defended in those days had become even more meaningful. Our approaches at that time have proved essential today, if we are to ensure the reconstruction and economic and social recovery of our country, and also of the European Union as a whole, in order to successfully address the consequences of the pandemic. Let me therefore go into detail with what was and continues to be at stake in the last proposal, the content of which is still disappointing today for the Spanish Government for three specific reasons. Firstly, because the total volume of the multiannual financial framework, i.e. the volume of budgets for the next seven years of the European Union, was and is insufficient. If we advocate ambitious budgets, capable of responding to the challenges of the future of the European Union, and also assuming the cost of leaving the United Kingdom, it is clear that we need to aspire to much more, much more resources. We are talking, among other issues, for example, about the new European green pact, the decarbonisation of productive activities, the justice of this ecological transition, migration policy, digital transition policy, neighbourhood policies, the common agricultural policy, cohesion policy and, in addition, a long one and so on. To give an idea, the initial proposal defined a Community budget size of 1.074 % of the gross national income of the Union as a whole, only four hundredths more than last December's Finnish proposal. In short, it involved a practical freezing of the European budget and was therefore unacceptable. The Government of Spain obviously opposed it, as you all know. We must also remember at this point that the European Commission's initial proposal was 1.114 % of gross national income and that that of the European Parliament was an even higher proposal, 1.3 %. I believe that an ambitious budget is today - and we could all agree, ladies and gentlemen - an indispensable condition; without it we will not be able to respond to the enormous challenges before us, those we had and those we will have after the pandemic. After the crisis of the COVID-19 we need a European budget that is qualitative and quantitatively different from all those that have preceded us so far. Spain, ladies and gentlemen - you have the conviction, the certainty - is one of the countries that is struggling most to make this happen and we will continue to do so at the European Council that is being convened for tomorrow. There is an idea that we have to start to assume in all areas and also in this, and that is that the pre-crisis does not serve as a standard of measurement. We have to invent a new normality and, therefore, we have to do it with ambition, and ambition has to be accompanied logically by budgetary resources. The second reason for their disappointment earlier has to do with the huge cuts in two traditional policies - one of which has also proved essential after the outbreak of this pandemic - one is the common agricultural policy and also the cohesion policies that constitute the backbone of the European Union. At this point, the Spanish Government has firmly defended the need to break with the misleading disjunctive which seeks to counter the supposed old European policies common to policies that make no sense, negative policies even for the construction of Europe, and to associate good policies with new policies. Nothing further from reality, ladies and gentlemen; I have heard it from the rostrum when we also had the opportunity to talk about the financial perspectives in times past. We must maintain both priorities; cohesion policies and, above all, the common agricultural policy, which are the ones closest to the citizenry and which strengthen something very important which is now also called into question as a result of the crisis, which is the internal market and its proper functioning. With regard to cohesion policy, I would like to tell you that there will be no real convergence between regions, no equality of conditions or a real model change, such as the one calling for, for example, the European Green Agreement, without a strong cohesion policy. And we could not therefore accept a proposal involving a funding allocation for our country well below the initial proposal of the European Commission, which, let us remember, amounted to EUR 34 billion. There are still twenty-two European regions that after nine years have not recovered their level of GDP per capita prior to the 2008 crisis, all of which are concentrated in southern Europe, including twelve regions in Greece, five in Spain and four in Italy. The new financial framework cannot ignore the fact that our regions were impoverished as a result of the 2008 economic and financial crisis, worsening in terms of GDP per capita and unemployment compared to most European regions. Eleven, ladies and gentlemen, eleven of our autonomous communities would be downgraded to the next multiannual financial framework if we followed the line proposed by the Finnish Presidency. Fourteen of our regions would now be in transition or considered less developed regions. It would therefore be a strategic mistake not only for Spain, but also for Europe to allow for a reduction in policies aimed at compensating for the differences in development, especially in the peripheral regions, which benefit less from a central geographical position in access to the internal market. The Government was not prepared in February for proposals in cohesion to abandon those who suffered the most from the 2008 crisis. The new reality following the crisis of COVID-19 will add and aggravate economic and social impacts to which cohesion policy will have to respond in order not to leave anyone behind. And with regard to the common agricultural policy, I would like to say to you that, as you know, the next multiannual financial framework was an unprecedented opportunity for the agricultural sector to contribute positively to the transition to a climate-neutral economy by 2050. This is what the Spanish Government has defended. However, the proposal you know, the February proposal, set cuts of up to EUR 53 billion in the CAP, with a reduction of 10.8% for our country, something simply inconsumable while we require farmers and farmers to make further efforts to adapt to this ecological transition, rural workers who are asking us to accompany us in the modernisation they are doing and who are facing the consequences of depopulation, which is another of the challenges of our country and of the European continent. We therefore make clear our refusal to cut the budget and our demand to maintain at least the same amount for the CAP in current terms as in the current multiannual financial framework, including direct payments, which are so important to our farmers. The new proposal included in this section the Just Transition Fund for Climate Neutrality in 2050, a model with which our country and the Government of Spain, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, are fully committed. And from the government we have issued two warnings to the rest of the members of the European Council: the first, that the criteria of division should not reward those who have not done their duties, among other things, because we did them a few months ago; and the second, that there must be an equalization of rules between the European Regional Development Fund and the Just Transition Fund, and this is important for the ecological transition to be financed through both instruments and for the level of development of each of the regions on our continent to be taken into account. The third reason for disappointment that we do not share the European Council's approach in February was the maintenance by the Presidency of the Council and the then Finnish Presidency of the cheque system, although its logic only made sense with the United Kingdom's stay in the European Union. This is a regressive system that the Spanish Government wants to eradicate as soon as possible, as it goes against any redistributive justice to reward even more those who have more and therefore those who enjoy more wealth. Ladies and gentlemen, as I said earlier, the reality of the days following that European Council drastically altered our agendas and our priorities. We have not stopped working on this since then, although the next meeting of the European Council, to which I shall now refer, necessarily had another much more urgent content, which is the response to COVID-19. The macroeconomic framework governing the previous proposals has completely expired, it is already a wet paper, and the urgency of a genuine Marshall Plan - if you will allow me to express it - for social and economic reconstruction in Europe places the multiannual financial framework again at the centre of all our negotiations. We are confident that the European Council tomorrow that we will hold in the afternoon will be able to come up with a first consensus that is in line with the position maintained by the Spanish Government in February, which I have just explained to you, because what was before just and convenient is now simply essential; essential for the European Union to deserve that name and not that of a circumstantial grouping of commercial interests. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I am now reporting on the European Council held by videoconference on 26 March and, logically, on the position of the Government of Spain in the European Council that we will hold tomorrow afternoon. With regard to the European Council of 26 March, in the face of the global public health crisis caused by COVID-19 in our countries, the governments of the Member States have held numerous meetings to coordinate a collective response. Thus, on 17 March, there was already a video conference after which we adopted a joint statement expressing the deep solidarity of the 27 EU Member States with the victims of the pandemic and their families, a text that reflected objectives in four major areas that I would like to remind them of: the first, the containment of the pandemic; the second, a better distribution of health resources through some centralised purchases at European level; the third, support for research to find a vaccine as soon as possible, and finally preparations for social and economic recovery. With regard to the first point, namely the adoption of measures to contain the spread of the virus, as of 26 March all Member States had already taken different measures against the pandemic. The Government of Spain in particular had launched for two weeks - remember - the most stringent measures, along with Italy, from all over the continent. The European Council confirmed that all these national efforts, including ours, met the criteria of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the recommendations of the Commission's advisory panel on COVID-19. In addition, the Croatian Presidency, which is right now leading - let us say - the Union's designs, has activated the Union's integrated policy response to the crisis to carry out a coordinated follow-up of developments. At the last European Council we discussed two important points concerning the mobility of people, which you know of: the control of external borders with the application of a 30-day, now extended, temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the European Union. Secondly, a smooth management at the internal borders, where there would be - let us say - controls to ensure that these do not affect essential movements, especially the cross-border workers of essential goods - our country, logically, affects that relationship with France and Portugal - and, in addition, the measures adopted to contain the virus, which are having an impact on the agricultural sector in several countries, including ours. The European agri-food chain has demonstrated its resilience and capacity to ensure the regular delivery of food to European citizens in quality and quantity, despite all the restrictions imposed by Member States to tackle the outbreak of COVID-19. However, the closure of the hotel, restaurant and catering sector will severely affect the agri-food sector, especially a large number of farmers whose products will not be released into the market in the short term. The Government is therefore urging the Community authorities, ladies and gentlemen, that all instruments of the common agricultural policy be deployed urgently to deal with market disturbances, thus helping farmers to maintain the productive potential that provides food for Europe. Finally, we share the need to firmly counter the bubbles and misinformation through transparent and responsible communication. The European Commission and the High Representative will be fully involved in this matter and will report to the Council on joint efforts. With regard to the provision of medical supplies, which was the second of the issues we dealt with at that Council in March, it is important to remember, ladies and gentlemen, that we were moving then, and still today, in a difficult buying environment and a highly aggressive market. We therefore call on the European Commission to continue and accelerate its assistance to ensure the rapid and adequate supply of medical equipment throughout the European Union, which was our top priority. The need for authorisation to export these resources outside the European Union was also established. Since it cannot be otherwise, we appreciate the efforts made by the European Commission to relocate resources, to increase the initial budget for the strategic reserve of medical equipment. Let me add to this one of the proposals that the Spanish Government is already promoting within the framework of the European Union, such as the need to carry out regular stress-testing of our national health systems as part of the European Semester. That is to say, just as the European Commission regularly monitors public finances or macroeconomic imbalances by requiring minimum levels of solvency, we will ask that the same be done with Member States' health systems to ensure their robustness in the future. Thirdly, with regard to the promotion of medical research, we agree to strongly support research and to coordinate efforts within the European scientific community in order to develop a vaccine as soon as possible. That is why we call for collaboration not only within the European Union, but also in the rest of the world, especially among our partners in the G-20 and also in the G-7, and we welcome the initiatives taken by the Commission, the European Innovation Council and the Group of the European Investment Bank to provide financial support for the assistance response and the promotion of research. Ladies and gentlemen, this pandemic is global and international collaboration is essential. That is why I would also like to stress at this point the importance of the European Union's external action to help our neighbours on the southern side of the Mediterranean, of Ibero-America and, without a doubt, also of Africa in its efforts not only to combat COVID-19 - a message I will insist on tomorrow with my colleagues in the European Council - but also against the terrible economic consequences that the crisis of COVID-19 is going to have for a whole continent such as the African continent. I believe that the whole of the European Union and also a country like ours must show such solidarity with the African continent and with our Latin American brothers, as a result not only of the impact that the public health crisis is going to have, but also of the dramatic economic and social consequences that are going to live whole societies. With regard to the socio-economic consequences, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, the public health crisis caused by COVID-19 is leading to an unprecedented economic and social crisis. We've been able to see some data that shakes everyone who reads it. We are faced with a historic challenge that obliges us to work already for a reconstruction that must also be historic, a reconstruction that must necessarily be based on a strong and solidarity-based European response. Consequently, on 26 March the European Council took note of the progress made by the Eurogroup two days earlier and we appreciate the measures taken by the European Central Bank to ensure favourable financing conditions. We also welcomed the unprecedented use of the general derogation clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, which allows for indebtedness beyond what is normally foreseen, and the Commission's temporary framework, which has allowed for more flexibility and rapid authorisation of state and extraordinary aid launched by different Member States, including our country, in the context of the crisis. The Spanish Government recognizes, ladies and gentlemen, the will of the European institutions, reflected in all the instruments that have been put in place, as well as in the adaptation of the existing mechanisms to put them at the service of the current situation. However, as you know and I have already mentioned, our Government has called for new and ambitious mechanisms to prove that the Union is up to the expectations of its citizens. It must be said that in this endeavour we are not much less alone. That is why, before the 26th meeting, I signed, together with eight other European Heads of State and Government, a letter to the President of the European Council demanding that we work on a common debt instrument to help us finance the necessary economic and social reconstruction of the Union as a whole. As you know, at that time an overall agreement was not possible, but something important was agreed, and it was entrusted to the Eurogroup to work to offer us proposals within two weeks. On 9 April, the Eurogroup reached their agreement on short-term measures, insisting on this short-term temporary horizon in three directions: firstly, to protect workers by creating a support instrument to mitigate the risks of unemployment, which could finance, for example, ERTE in our country; secondly, to protect companies, with the support of the European Investment Bank; and thirdly, to support States in their health response through non-conditional access to a new MED line of up to EUR 240 billion. A total of EUR 540 billion is needed to respond in the short term with European funding to this crisis in COVID-19. What I think is even more important than what was agreed by the finance ministers on 9 April was the outline of the need for a reconstruction plan, a medium- and long-term recovery plan for our continent. At the video conference on 26 March, I already presented to the other European leaders our proposal for a Marshall plan for Europe, and the declaration incorporated the idea of a road map in that direction. I believe that, for the Spanish Government, the reconstruction plan must be of a size commensurate with the challenge before us, allowing for sufficient flexibility of the cohesion instruments - which are essential for managing it in those territories most damaged by the pandemic - which we believe are called upon to play a decisive role, and taking into account the different economic sectors that will be most affected in our country, in particular the tourism sector and the rest of the services. At tomorrow's European Council, ladies and gentlemen, we will address all these aspects. I would also like to convey to you the reasonable optimism of the Government, because the conclusions envisage that the exit from this crisis must be accompanied by sustainable growth and linked to the just ecological transition. We have made the fight against the climate emergency a cross-cutting pillar of our government action and have positioned Spain at the forefront of Europe in this area. The deterioration of our planet does not wait for reconstruction and must therefore be one of the main elements of it and of that future recovery of our continent. The Vice-President and Minister for Transitional Ecological and Demographic Challenge has made this known in a letter she has addressed to the European Commission together with others from her European counterparts. With regard to the repatriation of European citizens blocked in third countries, on 26 March we agreed on the desirability of intensifying and further accelerating efforts to ensure that citizens of the Union who are blocked in third countries and wish to return to our continent, to their countries, can do so. We are counting on the active support of the High Representative and the European Commission, which has already resulted in thousands of repatriations. The Government, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is in constant contact with its network of embassies and consulates around the world, whose employees, by the way, I take the opportunity to thank them for their tireless efforts to help Spanish citizens living abroad. The Minister has created a crisis unit, which is coordinating the return of Spanish citizens together with the autonomous communities, third countries and the Member States of the Union. In recent weeks, ladies and gentlemen, the return of more than 21,000 compatriots has been facilitated. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a long and complex summary of what has happened in these last two councils, but, as you well know, tomorrow we face a new meeting whose significance does not escape anyone. That is why I thought it appropriate to finish my speech with a brief reference to the position that the Spanish Government is going to hold at the Council meeting tomorrow. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of an indisputable fact, and it is that we must achieve the greatest possible unity among ourselves in order to rebuild our country, but the real possibilities of the measures we agree will depend on the existence of a major European reconstruction and recovery plan. That is why we have come to the European Council tomorrow with three major priorities that we are going to push in all areas and by all means. Firstly, the European Council should welcome the financial package approved by the Eurogroup, to which I referred earlier, and call for the completion of the preparatory work so that the instruments are ready by 1 June at the latest. This is key for Europe and is therefore key for our country. Secondly, the Spanish Government has made a proposal this week which seeks to bring together as much ambition as possible in defending our legitimate interests with a real possibility of agreement. We have proposed the creation of a large recovery fund of up to EUR 1.5 billion - three times as much as agreed in the Eurogroup - financed with perpetual debt and linked to the budget of the European Union. It is a solution that, in our view, offers four definite advantages that I want to share with all of you. Firstly, it would involve deep-lost transfers instead of repayable loans, which would only serve to aggravate the massive indebtedness of the countries of the European Union. Secondly, these direct transfers would be intended to finance a recovery and reconstruction programme that will enable the European economies to be revived rapidly, investing in key areas such as the ecological transition, the digital transition, the improvement of the European Union's industrial and technological autonomy and also investing in the most affected sectors, such as transport or tourism. Thirdly, the distribution of funds among Member States would take place in the light of the human, social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e. the bulk of resources should go to those countries most affected. Fourthly, financing through perpetual debt would mean that only interest would be paid, guaranteed jointly by the power of the European budget through the creation of real Community taxes, such as CO2 tax at the border or a tax on financial transactions, among others. The third priority for the Spanish Government in the European Council is to reach agreement on the next multiannual financial framework for the Community budget for the next seven years. At this critical moment Europe needs a budget as soon as possible - I think we can all agree on this - to maintain the allocation of agricultural and cohesion policies while strengthening allocations to other sectors that have proved to be key in this crisis, such as digitisation, the green transition or - why not say so too - research, science, migration or strengthening our health system. This is, in short, a pragmatic, effective and essential proposal; a proposal, moreover, which can be accepted by our most reticent partners - if I may say so - because it would not require legal changes that could lead to parliamentary or legal proceedings at national level, which are very important for certain more reticent partners. It is an instrument, in short, at the height of the gravity of the situation, but it would demonstrate the real intention of the Union to act with real scope, because we cannot limit ourselves to trying to put out the fire, ladies and gentlemen; it is about rebuilding the house and welcoming everyone in it. Ladies and gentlemen, I conclude my speech, and I would like to do so precisely by insisting on this idea. So far all our collective efforts have been directed in a fundamental direction, in which we continue, and it is to defend ourselves from the unexpected and brutal attack of the pandemic; to fight, each from its posts, to defend lives in this silent war without bombs. The moment comes when, without neglecting that defence - I insist, without neglecting that defence at all - we must also take decisive steps towards proposals that rebuild a common future, looking forward and on the basis of solidarity, a feeling that the European Union itself originated. Without losing perspective, we must get out of the rhythm imposed by the disease and take the political initiative to rebuild the landscape that appears after its passage, I insist, without neglecting our defense as little as possible. That is why this appearance reflects, precisely, the point at which we find ourselves. We need, ladies and gentlemen, to prolong the state of alarm, which has been our most effective measure of protection in the past weeks - here are the data - and at the same time to address the agreements that must make us face the future with ambition and hope, both on the national stage and on the European level. Ladies and gentlemen, we have lost a lot in these terrible days; above all, we have lost the lives of compatriots, family and friends, whom we have seen march in solitude and whose absence we are not going to recover. Like them, much of what has gone away in these unusual weeks will not return, and with that weight we will have to face the reconstruction of our lives and also of our country. That is why let us implement all our resources, all our potential as people, as a community, as a country, and that our competencies are aligned with our ambitions. Every confrontation that we encourage, every delay that we assume for other calculations and interests will be a burden that we will bear in the coming months and years. Each agreement we reach will, on the contrary, be the fertile ground from which to grow again. I, ladies and gentlemen, have confidence; trust in our autonomous and municipal institutions; trust in our social partners; trust in the European institutions, in their willingness to maintain the Union despite differences and difficulties; and trust, above all and above all, in our compatriots who have given an example of self-denial, of social discipline and of morals of unmatched victory; confidence in their capabilities, in their intelligence and, as I said before, in their spirit of victory. From their homes, from their jobs, from the hospitals, they are the ones who mark the way, ladies and gentlemen, and I therefore propose that we reserve the applause of this House for those who fight in the front line. More than the words of one or another speaker, it is they who deserve the tribute of applause. It is up to us, ladies and gentlemen, to respect your efforts and to pay tribute to it with the silent applause of our union. I hope that that will be possible in this meeting and in future meetings. Thank you very much. [[Ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group, of the Confederal Parliamentary Group of the United Nations Podemos-En Comú Podem-Galicia in common and of some members of the Government present in the Chamber, standing]]"", ""Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, good morning. I compare, as the President has said, before the plenary of this House for the second time - the first was on 16 December 2020 - in compliance with article 14 of Royal Decree 926/2020 of 25 October, declaring the state of alarm to contain the spread of COVID-19. I compare to be accountable to you for the management of the Government of Spain during this period. In just over a year - the first official case detected of COVID-19 was on December 8, 2019 in China - the world has lost about 2.5 million people victims of COVID-19, a virus that has broken the pillars of what we believed in; a virus that has forced us to rethink many things: our consumption model, our life model; a virus that has taught us the supreme value of science and also of the unity of action; a virus that must also make us aware of the gravity of some of the emergencies, especially the climate, which we urgently have to face; a virus that has also reminded us of the importance of public services, of the welfare state; a virus, in short, which has shown us that the great challenges we had must be faced urgently and firmly. We have learned a lot about the virus, ladies and gentlemen, in these long months of pandemic, but we still have great uncertainties and we must recognise them. The world has created in record time effective vaccines against COVID-19, but we need to keep surveillance at maximum levels and continue to investigate to shut down the virus and its new variants. In the midst of this health, economic and social emergency - I have said it many times - the progressive coalition government has had only one option: firstly, to be guided by science and not by superstition; secondly, to mobilize all economic and social resources to deal with the pandemic and to seek unity at the international, European, national, autonomous, local level, at all levels, and ultimately to include in the unity to the maximum of the political and social actors available. That is what the Spanish Government has tried to do on all fronts, ladies and gentlemen, that is what Europe has also done, and that is what we need all over the world to give a multilateral response to a global challenge. Unity was not complete - it must be acknowledged - in many areas. It has not been, for example, at the international level, where one of the major powers - the United States, in this case - has distinguished itself from the guide of the World Health Organization, and yet it has been possible to have unity in the European area in a consistent way with the agreement reached last July 2020, and there are the fruits, in the vaccination campaign, for example, with centralised purchase, despite all the difficulties in the supply of the vaccine by some of the major pharmaceutical companies with which the supply of doses was contracted last year. And unfortunately, ladies and gentlemen, unity was also not the rule at the national political level, despite the efforts made by the Executive and the constant appeals. It has been that unity with the social partners, and it has resulted, precisely, in seven agreements which I believe have guaranteed stability and certainty to workers and businesses. Yes, it did, but also with resistance because we were subscribing to this culture of co-governance in the autonomic and also in the local sphere, recognizing the contribution of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces to that multilateral debate that we all owe in terms of co-governance in response to this pandemic, thanks, for example, to the conferences of presidents but also to the Interterritorial Health Council, but unity was resented between the forces and especially in this House. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, when we bend the last corner of the pandemic, when we turn to the right of the exit from this health, economic and social emergency, I would like to start my speech with an appeal to unity addressed to all the forces of this House, to the forces that have always supported the measures of the state of alarm and also to those who did not. After a year of health, economic and social crisis, after a long year of economic break, with social consequences and enormous ravages on the productive fabric and also on employment, Spanish society is exhausted and expects of human policy, responsibility and generosity. [[Applauds]] Society, in short, ladies and gentlemen, calls for unity and unity is what I come to ask of this House. The year 2020 - we have said it many times - will be remembered as the year of the pandemic, as the year of the COVID-19, the year of social distance, if I may, but also of emotional proximity, the year of applause on the balconies, the year of recognition to our health professionals, who will always be in our hearts and minds, that of our teachers. I was once told by the Minister of Education that, compared to what is happening in other countries of the world and also in Europe, very close to us, only 0.7 % of the incidence has occurred in the classrooms. That means a lot about the work of the educational community on all fronts. I would also like to thank the members of the State Security Forces and Corpses, the members of Civil Protection, the firefighters, the Armed Forces, the transporters, the workers of the supermarkets, the food sector, all those men and women who were there at the worst, in the front line of the fight against the virus. We have said this on many occasions, but I believe that it always, always, must always be in our guide and in our conduct of political action. Spain, ladies and gentlemen, has, as you know, deployed a social shield, in my opinion the largest in our country's history, because it has been an unprecedented challenge that we have had to address in this long year of pandemic. But in order to put it in economic terms, in terms of figures, up to EUR 200 billion we have mobilised in order to be able to deal with all the consequences of this pandemic. We did so, ladies and gentlemen, to save lives, to save jobs and to save businesses; we protected workers with ERTE; we helped self-employed people, families and businesses; we supported families that were already vulnerable before the pandemic and also those that became vulnerable with unprecedented measures in our democracy but also as necessary as the creation of minimum living income. Allow me to dwell on this point, ladies and gentlemen, because today I would like to make a new announcement to you in order to continue to protect the Spanish economy and also to ensure that our country continues to make progress. The first thing I would like to move is that economic recovery is a promise, a firm hope, with unprecedented economic means that make it real, effective and possible. They make it the basis on which to establish not only the immediate present but also the future of our country. The economic and social recovery also has to be emotional because when Spain - as it already begins to do - progresses with a solid and transformative growth not only will the pockets and the public coffers be recovered but also the spirit, spirit, hope and tranquility of the Spanish and Spanish. Please note that since the pandemic began and we declared the first state of alarm in March of last year, the Spanish Government has implemented measures and aid to companies, workers, self-employed persons and households equivalent - as I said earlier - to 20% of gross domestic product; I repeat, 20% in less than a year. A protection exercise never seen in the democratic history of our country. For an idea to be made, only the payment of salaries and contributions for workers in ERTE and the provision of self-employed persons amounts to some EUR 40.8 billion of direct aid. In addition, more than EUR 116 billion of ICO loans are being mobilised. Clearly, we could not allow viable companies to close or destroy jobs because of a crisis that we always knew would be temporary, such as a pandemic, and that would last only for as long as the virus lasted. In addition, the Government transferred more than EUR 24 billion to the autonomous communities in 2020, also in 2021, so that they could cope with health expenditure, educational expenditure and also inject direct aid into the most affected companies because, as the autonomous administration, they were better placed - not only from a competitive point of view but as a conviction that they were - to know what the impact of the restrictions on each territory was and therefore what compensation should be derived from it. More than EUR 24 billion is also transferred to the Autonomous Communities. According to the various international indicators, the public support measures adopted in Spain are aligned or even higher than the average of the rest of the European Union and have had a very positive impact in terms of preserving the financial stability of our economy. Thanks to this safety net we have managed to protect our productive fabric, employment and the incomes of families and we therefore have an already solid basis for economic recovery. As I have told you before, I would like to inform you of a measure that we are going to take in the coming weeks from the Government of Spain and that the Executive will shortly approve an additional package of EUR 11 billion for new actions for businesses, SMEs and self-employed workers. [[Applauds]] These EUR 11 billion, ladies and gentlemen, are a significant amount of resources to continue to support, during the hard weeks that we still have ahead to finally overcome the pandemic, sectors of the economy that grew before the pandemic, which were competitive before the pandemic and which are now, logically, in an extremely difficult and complex situation, such as the tourism sector, hospitality, restoration or small business, among others. It amounts to EUR 11 billion to strengthen the solvency of their balance sheets and can thus resume their economic activity, make the necessary investments and hire the workers who need to start economic recovery in full. This progressive coalition government, ladies and gentlemen, has the vocation not only to leave no one behind - we have said this on many occasions both from a social and territorial point of view - but we also have the ambition to always look forward. Not only do we want to save businesses, not only do we want to save jobs, we want to strengthen those businesses and jobs, we want to create new businesses and new jobs. We have an unequivocal vocation to continue to bend the contagion curve but also the economic crisis curve under two parameters that I would like to share with you and a premise. The parameters are as follows: firstly, the seriousness and sobriety in the public accounts and, secondly, the modernisation of our economy to create jobs, jobs and more quality jobs in the coming years. The premise is clear: never lower the guard. Never, we can't get her down, we haven't gotten through the pandemic yet. With the state of alarm decreed on 14 March 2020 and the responsibility of the citizenry, ladies and gentlemen, we managed to bend the first curve of the pandemic. Therefore - I have said it many times before you - I believe that Article 116 of our Constitution, the state of alarm, works to maintain and bend the curve of the virus. And yet, I think that with a certain perspective we could also be aware that we made a de-escalation in that first wave too fast, pressed by the need to reactivate the economy, to remedy the emotional fatigue that, after an unusual experience as was the confinement so hard that we did during the month of March last year, evidently suffered our society. Co-governance, which has worked well, ladies and gentlemen, in all areas, could have worked better - we have to recognise it too - in that first descalation. The second wave, which reached all of Europe after the summer, forces us to resort again to the state of alarm, this time decreed for six months and this time with greater protagonistism by the autonomous communities and co-governance. That state of alarm, which we approved on 25 October 2020, was supported by the majority of the House, although I must say that I would have liked much more unanimity than we had then because it would have been useful to better address the new stage of the pandemic. What has happened, which we can assume as a teaching of the successes and also of the collective mistakes that we have had over these long months of pandemic, must serve as an example to improve responses and also to avoid future failures. Prudence is now, ladies and gentlemen, a civic duty but also a political duty. We run the risk that the arrival of vaccines will relax us sooner and we will see ourselves in a fourth wave that we must avoid. We must all take the challenge of avoiding a fourth wave as our own. Ladies and gentlemen, as you know, this state of alarm is logically different from the one adopted on 14 March in the first wave of the virus. First for its duration, as I said in the first of the appearances aligned with this state of alarm, until 9 May. These six months of implementation are the estimated time, not only by the Government of Spain, by the health authorities but also by the experts, to overcome the situation we are going through. Secondly, together with that duration, it incorporates an express recognition that it will cease to apply immediately in the event that the emergency is overcome earlier. In the fourteen days - simply to recall some data - prior to its approval, our country recorded an accumulated incidence of almost 362 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the fourteen days, the total number of deaths was 34,752, of which 655 were compatriots for the last week. The situation in Spain at that time was very serious, with an unstoppable upward trend and very worrying, and with the arrival of the change of season and the diseases associated with the winter's entrance we all saw how the hospital pressure increased to very critical limits. At that time we already had a greater diagnostic capacity, we had to recognize it, with more than a million PCR tests we did a week, and we also had a state strategy that drew up and approved the Interterritorial Council of the National Health System. In other words, the Spanish Government and the autonomous governments did their duty. And again the answer gave results to bend the curve. On 16 December in this House I explained that, thanks to the state of alarm and the strategy of containment of that second wave, we had been five consecutive weeks keeping the cumulative incidence down to 14 days. We moved from almost 530 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 14 days in the first week of November to below 200 cases. With the arrival of Christmas, ladies and gentlemen, the third wave also came, with a great lesson, which once again we must humbly assume at a global level and is that in all the countries of our environment there was a significant upswing because of the Christmas holidays. Even in countries with lower incidence during the first two hours, such as Germany, the rate of contagion and also of the deceased was literally triggered. The guard should not have gone down then and therefore we cannot go down now. Spain currently has a cumulative incidence of 236 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 14 days, a figure that we have managed to reduce by 62% in the last 14 days and the number of deaths amounts to 68,079 compatriots. The situation in Spain remains serious, there are in particular some territories where the cumulative incidence is significantly high, but the trend is downwards thanks to the measures taken. It is shown once again that the state of alarm works and that co-governance is working, which provides a repertoire of measures sufficient to bend the curve, but obviously they must be activated and also maintained. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to stress something very obvious to everyone and it is that in the face of any evolution of the virus, what the Government will do will be to reinforce, together with the Autonomous Communities, the restrictive measures and all those measures that are relevant. We did so, for example, on February 17, when we adopted a new ministerial order to prevent and control the spread of variants - the Brazilian, the South African - of COVID-19 in our country. This order dictates, as Minister Darias shared with her ladies and gentlemen, that all travellers from Brazilian and African airports keep a mandatory quarantine of ten days upon arrival in Spain and this period may be reduced to seven days if, after the initial quarantine of one week, a negative CRP is provided. The order entered into force, as you know, this very Monday, 22 February, with a duration of fourteen calendar days and with the option of being extended if deemed necessary by the health authorities. We all know that this is not an easy task, ladies and gentlemen, that the societies in which we live are very interconnected. We also know that the COVID-19 only needs a small wick to spread uncontrollably, but we do everything we have to do from the various public institutions. For example, the interterritorial council of 17 February, the day on which that order was adopted, also had the participation of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Mr Planas. The aim of their presence was to strengthen the control between the different administrations in the face of the start of the new agricultural campaigns, which we saw in the past months of July and August, in the summer of 2020, which involved a wick that spread the virus in different territories of our country, thus detecting, with that participation of the ministry, the housing needs of temporary workers and the correct planning to prevent possible outbreaks in a sector as important to our country as is the agri-food sector. Ladies and gentlemen, I would not like to move forward without quantifying the government's management here. Since he appeared two months ago, 10 meetings of the Inter-Territorial Council of the National Health System have been held, 7 of them as of year. In total, since the beginning of the pandemic, 17 conferences of autonomous presidents, 239 conferences and sectoral commissions have been held, including 75 plenary sessions of the Interterritorial Council of the National Health System, 201 meetings of the Evaluation and Monitoring Committee and 59 meetings of the Technical Management Committee, including those of the Technical Committee on Descalation. In addition, this must be added to the 12 meetings of the Scientific Committee, which I personally chaired. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, we are not going to deviate from our objectives, nor are we going to allow ourselves too much confidence. There is a road map for the Spanish Government which is summarized in three concepts: health, employment and social protection. We must therefore continue to work together until we achieve an incidence of less than 25 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 14 days. I insist, in the battle against COVID there can be no truce. Never. We have to win day by day and, therefore, we must all be consistent in the implementation of health measures. As we face that third wave, ladies and gentlemen, we are also approaching the most hopeful stage of all, the beginning of the end of this pandemic, in a context in which the cases of COVID-19 are coming down not only in Spain and Europe, but throughout the world for five weeks. Like never before in this pandemic. Consequently, we are entering a new international order and we have a challenge as a country, joining as a society, strengthening ourselves in this final line of the pandemic, which is the process of vaccination and the process of economic recovery and social reconstruction. Therefore, we are facing a new phase and, therefore, I ask for what I offer, unity of all the parliamentary forces. I said earlier, ladies and gentlemen, that 2020 was the year of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2021 has to be - it will be, ladies and gentlemen - the year of vaccination and economic and social recovery. I'll start with the first point, the vaccination. Ladies and gentlemen, as is evident from a crisis of international magnitude, such as the one we are suffering from, it can only be addressed from a response with international involvement and the strengthening of all multilateral institutions. That is why the Member States of the European Union have developed the European Vaccination Strategy, to which Spain joined on 12 June 2020. To date, the European Commission, ladies and gentlemen, has signed contracts with six pharmaceutical companies for the acquisition of a total of 2265 million doses. As you know, this is AstraZeneca-Oxford, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen, Pfizer-Biontech, Curevac and also Moderna. Recently, the European Commission has made progress in negotiations with Novavax and Valneva, whose contracts could also facilitate the purchase of 200 and 60 million doses respectively. As far as our country is concerned, the Council of Ministers has authorized the acquisition of 126 million doses of five vaccines: more than 52 million doses of Pfizer-Biontech; more than 31 million doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford; more than 8 million doses of Moderna; about 21 million doses of Janssen, which you know is only one dose; and around 23.5 million doses of Curevac. Thus, a total of more than 136 million doses for a population of just over 47 million inhabitants. Beyond the purchase of doses, Spanish scientists and scientists are playing a key role in the manufacture of authorised vaccines and also in the development of new vaccines. Three Spanish companies are actively involved in the manufacture of vaccines from large pharmaceutical companies and, therefore, this is a source of pride for all and for all. For example, there is the company Rovi, which has installed a new production line at its plant in San Sebastián de los Reyes, near the city of Madrid, for the production of millions of doses of the Modern vaccine destined for the markets of the United States. Together with Rovi is Reig Jofre, who reached an agreement with a large pharmaceutical company, Janssen, for the technological transfer of the production of the VOCID-19 vaccine, currently pending approval. The pharmaceutical capacity is 250 million doses per year and could start manufacturing before summer in Sant Joan Despí, Barcelona. Alongside this, Insud Pharma, for its part, will perform in its plant very close to here, in the province of Guadalajara, in Azuqueca de Henares, part of the international production of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca-Oxford. The company has been in charge of its filling and packaging since February. To strengthen this line of action, the Centre for Industrial Technological Development, the CDTI, has financed eleven company projects in Spain. The objective is to expand infrastructure, develop production capacities, also from vaccine packaging to VOCID-19 in both Spanish and international projects. In total, ladies and gentlemen, EUR 9.98 million has been mobilised, of which EUR 4.72 million is provided by the CDTI in the form of a grant. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we can be very proud of our research. Spanish science is also developing twelve new vaccines projects against COVID-19, three of which are coordinated by CSIC. Ten projects have already received funding of €7.8 million from the Ministry of Science and Innovation. All ongoing projects have developed a prototype or vaccine candidate and are carrying out the preclinical tests necessary to determine the validity of vaccines in animals. I would like to stress that there are five very hopeful projects funded by the Spanish public institutions. First, the one developed by the Mariano Esteban group, which has obtained very positive results in preclinical trials in mice, with a 100 percent efficacy in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This vaccine is stable and can be stored and administered under advantageous conditions and, therefore, if the results are positive - we cross our fingers - phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in humans could be started soon. Secondly, there is the Luis Enjuanes project, which is in a phase of negotiation with several companies for the encapsulation of nanoparticles, as preclinical tests in mice progress. This would not enter clinical trials until June 2021. Thirdly, that of the group of Felipe García, of the Hospital Clínic. The production of its vaccine candidate is being developed in the Catalan company Hipra and could start phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in humans in the second quarter of the year. Fourthly, there is the Hipra project, based on an antigenic protein. The company has the technology and also the production capacity necessary and plans to carry out preclinical trials in animals shortly in order to be able to start phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in June this year. Finally, the project of the Buenaventura Clotet group, which has completed preclinical trials in animals with a hundred percent efficacy. [[IrsiCaixa]] It is in negotiations with different companies to agree on the production of its vaccine and to start phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. In short, ladies and gentlemen, they are vaccine projects that fill us with hope, optimism and great pride for the company and also for Spanish science and research. [[Applauds]] For its part, the Interterritorial Health Council has played a key role in managing this crisis. It has been the meeting space between public administrations in the co-governance forum. It was there last December, for example, that the autonomous communities of both signs agreed with the Ministry of Health on a vaccination strategy at the state level; an indispensable mechanism to protect the health of all citizens. This Strategy has since been updated three times, in order to define new priority population groups and incorporate new available vaccines. As you know, because it has been reported by the media in different ways, the priority groups that we have defined so far and that will continue to be updated as circumstances change are as follows. First, residents and health and social workers working in the homes of older persons and caring for the large dependents. Secondly, front-line health and social health personnel. Thirdly, other health or social health personnel carrying out activities requiring close contact with people who may be infected. Fourthly, people considered to be big dependents. Fifthly, people over 80 years of age. Sixthly, active collectives with an essential role for our society, such as State Security Forces and Bodies, Emergencies, Armed Forces, teachers and personnel of child education and special educational needs, teachers and personnel of primary and secondary education. Seventh, people between 70 and 79 years of age. Eighthly, people between 60 and 69 years of age and, ninthly, those under 60 years of age are at high risk of suffering from serious disease by COVID-19. And finally, with the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, authorized in Spain for children under 55 years of age because this is the result of the clinical trials that the company has proposed, the rest will be for the healthcare staff and the age group between 45 and 55 years. Ladies and gentlemen, as I have told you before, obviously we are going through hard times, but joint efforts are beginning to yield results, and I would like to underline and put some figures that I believe are quite eloquent of the collective effort we are making and that we are deploying society and public administrations. Spain, ladies and gentlemen, is today the fourth country in the European Union in total number of doses administered, with more than 3.1 million doses, behind Germany, with 5.1 million doses; France, with 3.7 million doses and Italy, with 3.5 million doses. If we measure the average vaccination rate per 100 inhabitants, Spain is above these countries. Specifically, we occupy the thirteenth position in the European Union. The current rate of administration is about 540,000 doses per week. Until 17 February, 3622 165 doses of vaccines have been administered among the autonomous communities, 3165 191 doses have already been administered, or 87.4% of those received. Almost two million Spaniards have already received at least one dose. And from the Spanish Government we have set ourselves a very ambitious goal - I am aware - but necessary and possible. We have committed ourselves to reaching the target of 70% of the vaccinated population before the end of the summer. I am also convinced that the supply problems that have occurred in Europe in recent weeks will soon be overcome, especially with the new vaccines that are currently under way. Without going any further, we are thinking and estimate that Spain will receive the quadruple of vaccines in the next quarter. But our responsibility doesn't end here. In a pandemic that has paralysed the entire planet, some countries suffer more than others and, as public health is unquestionably global, our commitment to vaccination must also transcend borders, ladies and gentlemen. That is why the Council of Ministers approved on 19 January the Universal Access Plan, Solidarity Vaccination. What we are proposing, and we are defending it at European level, is that countries with the most difficulties can quickly access the vaccine. Since our status as a founding member of the ACT-Accelerator and part of its facilitation council, we will be giving priority to multilateral channels, such as the Covax partnership or the European Union's donation mechanism, and in recent months Spain has already committed EUR 50 million to GABI's Advanced Market Commitment, which is aimed at promoting vaccine production in the least developed countries. Ladies and gentlemen, as I have told you before, 2020 is going to be remembered for the year of the pandemic, the COVID, but we must also say that 2021 is going to be the year of the vaccination that will free us from the health nightmare that we have experienced in recent months and also the year of economic recovery. Economic recovery, ladies and gentlemen, is a certain, certain horizon. I understand that, in the midst of this thick fog, of this crisis, it is difficult to reach the end, but the exit is near. We are at the end of the health emergency and, consequently, also at the beginning of economic and social recovery. We are approaching recovery not only because the end of the pandemic is coming, but because we will have unprecedented means that will make it possible, real, effective. These unheard-of means, we could describe, make recovery a huge opportunity on which to lay our future for the country. They will remember that in the darkest moments of the pandemic a year ago, when it seemed to have no end and we could only ask the citizens resistance and social discipline, Spain demanded from Europe an unheard-of effort, a new Marshall plan, we said then. Well, that Marshall plan is here, that Marshall plan is quantified at more than €700 billion for the European Union as a whole, Spain will receive €140 billion in six years. In order for us to get an idea - as I have said to you on other occasions, ladies and gentlemen - the structural funds represented EUR 8 billion in six years and these are EUR 140 billion in six years - it is true that the gravity of the crisis justifies this - resources that go beyond what the whole of Europe received in the post-world war period. This economic and social recovery, as I said before, must also be emotional. And the engine of that recovery has a name, it's the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan in our country. It is the project I would say, ladies and gentlemen, of economic modernization, of more ambitious economic conversion in our country's economic history. We are working on this plan together with the European authorities in its implementation, and we have already begun to do so with the first meeting last week of the Inter-Ministerial Commission for Recovery, Transformation and Resilience, as well as with the creation of the technical committee to support that inter-ministerial commission. I have said on many occasions that this is a historic challenge, because we are also facing a historic moment, and managing EUR 140 billion from the Next Generation European Union Fund for Spain, from which we will be releasing almost EUR 80 billion in direct transfers over the next three years, will be the starting point for achieving this huge milestone. Ladies and gentlemen, the purpose is to grow, but to do so in another way; to grow by transforming, because precisely the rules and the international order have changed, as a consequence also of the pandemic. The path we are going to take is that of a Spain that has to be unequivocally more digital, more sustainable, more cohesive, more just and more feminist, and, ultimately, will mean a real revolution for our economy, in our way of life and also the achievement of a promising reality, which is economic recovery. These four transformations, mapped out and supported by Europe, fully coincide with our government agenda and with which I set out, as you will recall, when I presented the investiture programme, and will also define the action of the autonomous communities and the municipalities in the development of the plan. The purpose of these four transformations is one, to create the highest number of jobs, and the highest quality; to create solid, sustainable, quality and, of course, long-term jobs, thinking, above all, of the young people in our country, who are suffering unacceptable unemployment rates. The measures included in the plan will serve to reduce temporaryity, to facilitate the internal adjustment processes of companies and to invest in our public employment services. The plan aims to change the basis of our productive model in the medium and in the long term, but at the same time it will have a countercyclical effect of generating activity and employment in the short term. We are going to boost sectors with a high capacity to create quality jobs, such as sustainable building rehabilitation, urban mobility, the deployment of smart energy networks, the renewable energy park, the extension of broadband, the strengthening of green and water infrastructure, reforestation and biodiversity conservation in our country, the improvement of social services and also the boost to the care economy. Employment, ladies and gentlemen, is the foundation of any economic policy and is undoubtedly the main objective of the Government of Spain. And whenever I talk about employment, I mean quality and sustainable employment, not precarious employment, which unfortunately has been created in recent years. That is why I inform you that all calls for projects of the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan that will be carried out in collaboration with the private sector - industrial, digital, technological, energy projects - will have among their main criteria of eligibility the creation of quality employment. According to our estimates, ladies and gentlemen, the plan will create about 850,000 jobs in the next three years. And we're going to do all this without leaving anyone behind. We must protect the weakest, ladies and gentlemen, and create wealth at the same time, not only as much as possible, but also by redistributing to all spheres of our society. We cannot repeat an ultra-liberal obsolete model that proposed to concentrate wealth on 1% of the social pyramid so that sooner or later a part will reach the most disadvantaged. That model is unfair, and I think the pandemic has made it much more visible that it is inefficient, that it does not work. Retrieving a country in another way, leaving some untempered, is just doing half the job, and we must strive to do the full job, because everyone deserves the opportunity to live decently. [[Applauds]] Allow me, ladies and gentlemen, at this point, to speak of quality employment, I am referring, above all and especially, to training and education. There's no one without the others. Our clear objective is to promote the creation of skilled jobs - I said earlier - by promoting training, by promoting talent and also by attracting global talent, which has gone to us and also another foreign talent, to our country. What we have learned over the past few years is that in the medium term technology always creates more jobs, many of them also associated with the development, management and repair of the technologies being implemented. We are very aware, ladies and gentlemen, that programmers, mechanics or data scientists will increase in the immediate future. It is expected that the largest employment growth in the coming decades will be concentrated in sectors linked to health, technology, R & D & i, leisure and also entertainment, and this means that, with artificial intelligence and digitisation, the entire Spanish labour market, like that of the rest of the world, will be transformed. It will increase the number of jobs and, logically, the distribution of occupations and the organization of work will be different. Today we know, ladies and gentlemen, that the world is losing 23 million euros in GDP by not closing the gap between men and women. That is to say, if we achieve real and effective equality between men and women - I also say this in the week we started, when the unacceptable wage gap between men and women has become very eloquent and very visible - we would not only have fairer societies, but also much more prosperous societies. These losses are compounded by the failure to correct the intergenerational gap, to which he referred earlier, by the unacceptable youth unemployment rates. We must be aware that the advanced Spain will need more health personnel specialized in care, in older and dependent people, as well as profiles in psychology and guidance. Spain of the future, which is already Spain in which we are working in the present, will need more scientific staff, more engineers, more engineers, more renewable energy professionals, recycling, water management, building rehabilitation or sustainable food. And in this respect, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to share with you some of the information that has to do with qualifications and employment. Note that graduates in an intermediate vocational training cycle have almost 30% less unemployment than those in high school. Four years after obtaining an educational degree, the unemployment rate is 6 points lower in middle-grade FP graduates and 10 points lower in upper-level FP graduates than the unemployment rate in high-school graduates, according to the labour integration survey prepared by the National Institute of Statistics. This represents a huge opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, to reduce youth unemployment and to bet definitively, as we are going to do from the Government, as we are already doing from the Government, on vocational training. In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, on 22 July we presented the Plan for the modernisation of vocational training 2020-2023, with the aim of turning personal training into a lever for economic growth and the creation of youth employment, with three main lines: the first, the recognition and accreditation of professional competences. Ladies and gentlemen, 48 %, that is, almost half of the working population, more than 11 million people, does not have a formal recognition of their competences, having been trained through practice. The aim, therefore, is to establish in record time, i.e. in four years, the competences of 40% of this population under fifty-five, which is equivalent to more than 3.3 million people. I mean, what we were doing in ten years, we're going to do in four years, and that's going to be very good for the employability of a lot of workers in our country. [[Applauds]] The second is the relaunching of vocational training both in the education system and in continuing vocational training for employment, making it more flexible and more accessible. It is planned, ladies and gentlemen - I also said this in the investiture speech - to create in the next four years 200,000 new places of vocational training, in a training catalogue that has to be renewed, because the demands of the labour market have changed radically, in order to respond accordingly to these needs and to ensure that the lack of trained human capital does not become a burden for growth, the improvement of competitiveness and employability. Thus, vocational accreditation, vocational training and, thirdly, the incorporation of digitalisation, innovation and entrepreneurship into the vocational training system. Among the actions proposed are the following: firstly, the implementation of a digitalisation module applied to the productive sector for the unemployed and employees who will train 125 000 people annually over the next four years and the incorporation of a digitalisation module applied to the productive sector in each and every one of the vocational training qualifications. I would also like to recall, ladies and gentlemen, that the Government, within the framework of the Digital Spain 2025 strategy, has already promoted the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy, the 5G Technology Impulse Strategy, the Plan for Digital Connectivity and Infrastructures and the Entrepreneurship Nation Spain Strategy. And along with these plans, we have presented three more: first, the National Plan of Digital Competencies; second, the Plan of Digitalization of SMEs 2021-2025 and, third, the Plan of Digitalization of Public Administrations. Ladies and gentlemen, employment, employment and employment, improving our well-being and the transformation our country deserves. Look, ladies and gentlemen, at those who are old enough to do so, I ask you to remember the magic of 1992. When the Olympic Games and the Expo de Sevilla were held in Spain, with the opening of the first line of high speed Madrid-Sevilla, the Spaniards who were born in those years were barely beginning their adolescence when the crisis broke out in 2008. The COVID-19 crisis has caught them trying to start an adult life, and we must recognize that an entire generation has had to assimilate uncertainty, a generation that knows only survival, into a continuous crisis. If an idea is repeated in the head of all those young people, it is that of 'everything that costs them everything'. It is difficult for them to develop in their territory, it is difficult for them to find a job and they also perceive stable work as a sort of luxury; it is difficult for them to access decent housing, it is difficult for them to develop a personal life, to emancipate themselves and, in addition, the decision to be mothers and fathers is increasingly delayed. And this, ladies and gentlemen, has to change, it has to change if we want to transform Spain and if we want our country to move forward, because we cannot draw a future of progress on the sacrifice of our younger generations. In this regard, I would like, if I may, to convey my gratitude, on behalf of the entire Government, to the young people for their behaviour. Often the media, ladies and gentlemen, point out, denounce some irresponsible conduct by some young people, and they are true, but that is not, much less, the standard of conduct of our young people. [[Applauds]] It is true that it is easier to contain, maintain distances and even remain isolated from a certain age, but it is much more difficult to do so with the vigor of youth, and yet the vast majority of our young people have done so, and have done so more out of responsibility to their elderly, vulnerable, than out of their own health. And that must also be said and recognized. Ladies and gentlemen, the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, this possible future for Spain, I would say, ladies and gentlemen, would be nothing without the General Budgets of the State that have started on the first day of 2021 and that will involve concrete actions to transform the economy of our country in a real way; public accounts that are aligned with the priorities and strategies of the plan; budgets that have received maximum plurality of support, up to eleven different political parties. In the history of our democracy, I do not think there is as much plural support as the one that has received these accounts. Budgets are our great lever of change, the lever for a transformation I would say real, and they amount to a total of EUR 239 billion to combat the effects of the pandemic and to shield our welfare state. This unprecedented social investment includes, for example, the largest share of scholarships, increases the policy to combat child poverty by 59%, in addition to the minimum living income, allocates 3 billion euros for the consolidation of that minimum living income, strengthens the unemployment benefits by more than 4 billion, equalizes the paternity and maternity leave in sixteen weeks - I think this is a collective success also of your lords -, allocates 180 million euros to the prevention of male violence, increases the health policy by 75.3%, firmly committed by our young people, increases the housing policies by 25%, those of culture - which is a very damaged sector, as we all know - by 26%, allocates 11 million euros to tasks also very important to our democracy, as we saw yesterday precisely with 23 February, as is the democratic memory, and, without a doubt, also does justice with our older generations by increasing non-contributory pensions. In short, we are putting an end to the pandemic thanks to vaccination, we are protecting the most vulnerable families, we are supporting jobs, companies, the self-employed, now we are going to inject, ladies and gentlemen - I want to repeat it again - EUR 11 billion more to continue to reactivate our economy and we are projecting the country we want to be, the Spain we want, which is Spain, in short, which the Spanish deserve. I think we have reason to look to the future with confidence and hope. Spain, ladies and gentlemen, is an admirable country and deserves us to do so. Spain deserves, after the greatest calamity of this century, that this be the legislature of recovery and also of the modernization of our economy. Ladies and gentlemen, just over a year ago I presented a country project to get the support of this House, to unlock in 2019, after five electoral processes, the governance of the country, to be invested president and to address the challenges of Spain, ultimately to put real solutions to the real problems of the real people. We wanted to do many things, and in reality, the management of this pandemic has required us to do many more and address them with greater care and determination. And on this point I would like to acknowledge the work of the two parliamentary groups and that of each and every one of the ministers and ministers of the Government of Spain, both of the Socialist Parliamentary Group and of the United States. [[Applauds]] Ladies and gentlemen, this year 2021, in which we will leave this health drama behind with vaccination and embark on economic recovery, will also be a turning point, and at this point I would like to return to my initial appeal, as unity in this House was not the norm throughout 2020, a very hard year, and ask you to at least stick together the exit line of the pandemic and the start of economic recovery and social reconstruction. We owe it to all the citizens of our country, to whom we serve, to whom we owe. They do not take into account the vote when maintaining hygiene measures or social distance. Health care providers, police officers, basic service employees do not attend to the political colour to assume and deploy their obligations. We can exchange criticisms, criticisms - I am convinced that we are going to do so once again from this rostrum throughout this morning - but let us try not to poison the social atmosphere, that they do not distill hatred, that they do not bring discouragement or that there is no strength for a purpose that we all share, which is to overcome the crisis and undertake recovery. We need the energy of all, of all, ladies and gentlemen. There's more to anyone's hate. Everything is possible from unity and nothing, on the other hand, is built from division and resentment. The Government, with the unity of all, or of all who want to contribute at least to the action of the Government, with the help of all, or all who want to join, will continue to work for Spain to move forward, to overcome this painful trance of the pandemic and to take its rightful place in Europe and the world. Thank you very much, Madam President. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. [[Prolonged applause by the ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group, the Confederal Parliamentary Group of the United Nations Podemos-In Communal Podemos-Galicia in Communal and the members of the Government,]]"", 'Mr President of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, Members of the People\'s Party, the Galego Nationalist Bloc and the Galician Socialist Party, invited in the House, the Greeks and the Greeks, this investment session culminates in a process that began on 10 February, the date of the decree which dissolved Parliament and, with it, the X legislating of our autonomy. The Galicia that we have before us almost seven months later, after we are forced to speed up the April 5 celebrations by the coward-19, the Galicia that we represent today by the citizen will finally expressed in the July 12 elections, is very different from that moment. Any illusion we had then is now conditioned by the countless uncertainties that generate the pandemic. Any positive data has diminished by its effects. Any challenge is subject to its evolution and any step forward that we make will be marked by the deep emotional rift that causes how much we suffer and we will continue to suffer, especially the 644 families the coronavirus seized from a loved one before time, and also all those who couldn\'t say good-bye from their proximity and the grips we need when someone dies. He has come up with a new historical circumstance that compels us to live with a pandemic, and this means bringing with us the pain that it means in so many Greeks. With much more reason, in this Parliament we are obliged to respect so much suffering with our forms and with our deeds. Of course, my duty is to keep it in mind. [[Applause]] There are more than 3,600 people affected by the virus in Galicia right now. The vast majority, 95.7% of the total number of infections, is overcoming the disease in their homes, but there are 17 people fighting in intensive care units and 143 who are in hospital plants. Since March 8 the first person was released, 12,771 won the virus, but some of them have physical or psychological sequels. And unfortunately everything indicates that there will continue to be new infections, as we said months ago. All these people, like those who are already suffering or will suffer the social and economic consequences of all this, they also demand an exceptional response for an unprecedented moment, and we have to give it to them. Of course I will. This is the fourth time that I request Parliament\'s support to preside over Galicia. I\'ve always come proud of my people, and today even more for the determination he\'s faced with such a difficult moment. I have always come to realize the responsibility it entails, and today even more so, because no other legislation — not even the first, in full economic recession — presented as many needs and challenges as there are now. I\'ve always come with illusion, and today even more, because, despite all the obstacles, I\'m convinced that we can overcome ourselves as we have done before. And I\'ve always come with the vocation to keep Galicia united, and today even more, because it\'s not the time of selfishness but to work together for the common good. Ladies and gentlemen, the autonomic executive who will have Galicia, if I have the confidence of this House, will be prepared to continue ruling from the first day and for all citizens. Like those who have voted for us, those who have supported other parties — whether they have been represented or not — can be sure that the future government will be theirs as well. It will be the government of all, without exception. I don\'t devise any other way of ruling. [[Applause]] The unity that is needed at this moment also requires this House, which, after a few unusual months, is back in operation on an ordinary basis for three reasons that I would like to expressly acknowledge. Together with the Basque Country we were the first territory to organize elections during a pandemic and, as a people, I think we can be satisfied by the date chosen, by the execution and by the citizen\'s response. The experts pointed to July as the safest time to hold elections. I will not take account of what the different parties have said in this regard. I didn\'t do it or I\'ll do it because I understand that what counts is the experts\' opinion. They had a great responsibility, but they assessed us, they advised us, and in view of the fact that this clinical committee of the Galician Health Service was right when I proposed elections in July. We must also thank the organization of the errands for the people who have kept an eye on everyone\'s safety. For history they\'ll have done a great job. And, above all, the Greeks showed their participation in the polls, above any logical fear, unbreakable adherence to democratic values, for the good, and also for the bad times. Ladies and gentlemen, I will never tire of thanking the new absolute majority harvested by the People\'s Party in Galicia. Many analyses were carried out on it, as were also done on the remarkable rise of the Galego Nationalist Block — so again I congratulate its members — or on the results of parties that formed and formed the coalition of the Central Government, or also on the disappearance of forces present in the past legislation and other parts of Spain. However, I see a mistake that we are only left in party readings, because what is decided at any beginning is not the situation in which each training remains, but what the people say for their own future. And we must know how to interpret it to be completely useful to you at this complex moment. In my opinion, beyond acronyms and candidates, stability and moderation are the main winners of the elections that make up this parliament. [[Applause]] The victory of stability comes from the majority conviction that it is the best formula ever, but even more so to face the many uncertainties that we have today. The stability given by a government that is not a beginner, because any experience is little to deal with a situation like this. And the stability that gives a solid and undivided Government, therefore capable of making decisions that are necessary, without internal pulses, without more submission than the general interest. The second - I said - was the victory of moderation, that nothing has to do with weakness, indecision or ambiguity; quite the contrary. The moderation that the Greek people advocate is synonymous with determination, respect and humility. And that\'s positive for management and coexistence. In management, moderate policies allow for calm and effective changes, constant and safe, such as those we apply in the 2008 crisis. In living together, moderation unites, because moderation facilitates encounter points that are not feasible with doctrinal theses. I think I\'m not mistaken if I say that to elect a government, and also to form opposition, citizens received more moderation. Therefore, it would be fraudulent to answer them now by hardening our respective positions from each party. I won\'t do it, and I hope you don\'t either. They don\'t understand this as a purely rhetorical request. The moment we live really requires everyone\'s involvement. I appeal to the spirit of understanding that the Greek society has shown in these months, which we must now reproduce in this chamber to face the two major challenges we have: the health challenge and the socio-economic challenge. We must continue to work in common. That is why I want my first concrete proposal today to constitute in this Parliament a committee that will enable us to define together the pact of reactivation that needs and deserves our land. Ladies and gentlemen, the pandemic is proving everything; also politics, which in recent years has not always been up to circumstances. Many citizens will wonder if even a situation like the one we live in will make their representatives better. Our duty is to prove to them that yes, that Galicia is. That forces us, first of all, to tell them the truth at all times. We\'ve addressed citizens who have demonstrated their maturity by trying to look after everyone. In recent months, many sacrifices have been made, they have put up with great civic restrictions on rights and freedoms, they have adapted to new obligations and prohibitions, they have had exceptional behaviour. And bad response will be given to them if we now underestimate the situation or if we are wrong about the instruments we have and those we don\'t have to deal with. Ladies and gentlemen, at the last session of control of the past legislation, on February 5, I said that Galicia has had a good evolution in recent years. I reflected, for example, that he recorded the highest gross domestic product in his history. Well, that Galicia that had been growing for five consecutive years, which reached employment levels prior to the 2008 crisis, which consolidated its recovery and excitedly prepared the best Xacobeo in its history, now suffers the blows of these last few months. Today\'s reality is that society, economics and well-being are being severely affected. So I\'m not here - and I hope neither do you - to promise four simple years. I didn\'t do it in the election campaign and I won\'t do it today, because the Greeks didn\'t choose me to lie to them. What we live for is no longer a crisis. If the 2008 crisis was tough, what\'s about to come is very hard. And although there are quite overwhelming predictions, the truth is that their dimensions are still unknown. Unfortunately this is the case, and so we have to tell the citizens. We must speak with transparency because it is our duty, but also to raise awareness of collective responsibility, especially in view of the evolution of infections in recent weeks. We have to assume that the month of August was demolition. At present, in Spain, about six thousand seven hundred cases are again diagnosed daily, and in Galicia above the 200 sixty daily cases. To a greater or lesser extent, the whole nation recorded a clear rebound that was expected all over the world, but that comes before the predictions that the Government had transmitted to us, and again with more force in Spain than in other countries in our surroundings. In this context, there are responses that are appropriate for organizing different administrations, but we need to be aware that no government should fight the virus without citizen collaboration. Being scrupulous, each person contributes to the progression of the contagion. If anyone relaxes, caress about the hygiene of their hands, the use of masks or physical distance, there are consequences that we all pay for. And, of course, we have to be ruthless about irresponsible behaviors, of those in Galicia we have suffered some particularly regrettable example. Prevention is the most valuable thing we have to protect ourselves while there is no effective vaccine or treatment in the world. All we have left after prevention is the restrictions, with all that it means. And that\'s why we have to keep insisting: if we relax and trust ourselves, we will retreat and confine ourselves. I want to address the young and not so young, all those people who, because of their age or physical condition, feel invincible against the virus. They\'re wrong. 80% of the cases detected in August are under the age of sixty; more than half, under the age of forty; a quarter, twenty-five or less. Most of them coincide with parties, family gatherings or recent trips. They worry about them, but especially because in many cases they are asymptomatic that continue the line of infections until they reach more vulnerable people, as unfortunately is already happening. The average age of the deceased in Galicia with curfew-19 since the beginning of this new increase in cases is 83.6 years. So, among all of us, we should try to prevent this trend from continuing, taking care of older people, as would older people. Is there any doubt that our elders would put everything on their side, everything they needed, all that was in their hands, all that and more, and all the time it was necessary to protect us? As far as we want, we all take care of ourselves, and we especially take care of our older ones. As far as we\'re concerned, let\'s take precautions and comply with the rules. As much as we like, let\'s keep trying. [[Applause]] Galicia must continue to be an example for Galicia, by its exhausting result. And throughout Spain, Galicia has to remain an example of sentiño, with measures to protect public health and with measures to protect the economy and collective well-being. Those two objectives will mark the immediate priorities of my Government if I gain the confidence of this chamber, without neglecting the challenges we had before the pandemic. Ladies and gentlemen, in an investment session like this, the usual thing is to present a roadmap in the medium and long term. I will, too, because Galicia of the new decade had drawn up a pre-covid strategy, which we will certainly not give up. I\'m summoned by every measure that we set out in the electoral program to achieve a more familiar Galicia, a younger Galicia, a more innovative Galicia and a more open Galicia. And, yes, I\'m fully aware that the first thing we\'re about is the emergencies, the emergencies generated by the pandemic. That\'s why my duty is to make it clear that the most important moment in legislation is this. It will center the first and most of the intervention, because probably no other challenge, however big, will be at the level of what we play in the next weeks and months, and I hope not years. The result depends on us, but also on what Spain we\'re part of achieves as a whole. My commitment is to continue working with the central government, as it has so far, supporting what is right and marking what we can all improve in, because that\'s also loyalty. To warn about errors, such as delays in national alerts or constant changes in criteria in data, to denounce the central government\'s inaction in key areas, such as the homes of older people, to regret the lack of a single leader in the acquisition of material or in the course of school, to surprise us by ignoring requests as basic as those we have done to reduce the EVI by 21% of the mandatory-use masks or to reject the legal strategy being developed is compatible with recognizing the efforts of most members of the state executive and wishing them to do everything they can. Ladies and gentlemen, I see neither Mr. Sánchez nor Mr. Churches, leaders of one party or another; in this situation I see only the Government of our nation. Both they and the autonomic leaders know that the Greek people have been, it is and will remain at the disposal of the common interest. Join us in the objective of getting out of this with the greatest possible strength, and nothing, absolutely nothing is more important than that. There is nothing more important than continuing our efforts to maintain as a Community data that, in the midst of so much pain, encourages us in the field of health; as being one of the least affected communities of the virus - fifth at this time - with the lowest lethality rates in Spain, with the lowest rate of hospitalisation - together with Asturias and Extremadura - with fewer serious patients in relation to the population - the second - or with less mortality in residences than in Spain - seven times less deaths than we would have in the population -. And there\'s also nothing more important than avoiding among all a second generalized confinement. We need the economy to work to keep counting on the resources that finance public services, and we need not to tear down the productive fabric as a whole so that what works will help the sectors that are being irremediablely affected. With maximum health care, we all need to protect ourselves. With the greatest determination and energy of all of us, we all have to work for everyone. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, at a public meeting on March 13, I said that we all had a duty to meet this crisis, but not all of us would have the same responsibilities. Over this time, and political apart, there is no doubt that the greatest weight has fallen on the more than 40,000 professionals who guarantee the functioning of hospitals and health centres. And more specifically, in those who care for foster patients and in the thirty-five professionals who form the Clinical Committee and study each situation, each risk and propose each measure. They do it with uncommon rigor and effort, and they do it as they ask us all to respond to this threat: without giving up in any circumstance as hard as it may be. We\'ll never thank you enough. In fact, the health challenge is the most important, conditions everything else. And as I told you, we\'re at a critical time, because evolution in Spain is bad, and in Galicia, even if there\'s less impact, too. The incidence in Spain in the last 14 days is 205.5 cases diagnosed by 100,000 inhabitants, placing us at levels equivalent to those of April 2. We are again the European country with the worst evolution and we multiply by 2.3 the incidence of the second most affected nation, France. In Galicia this indicator continues below the national average: 123 in Galicia, 205 in Spain. But the trend in Galicia is also negative. It is true that there are 99 municipalities without new cases in the last two weeks, 130 municipalities without new cases in the last seven days and nearly 200 municipalities without registering any cases in the last three days. But we must be aware of the evolution of the most affected areas and at all times protect residences and centres of disability. The current situation is 161 active cases in residences, which means 0.57 % of the total users. In this context, in Galicia we reacted as we did from the very first moment, even before the Spanish ensemble had publicly warned about the coronavirus. They know that already in February we constituted an interdepartmental commission of the Galician Union, we started on 1 March hiring the first professionals in the field of public health and we increased the stocks of respirators to the point that we are now able to triple the number of critical beds compared to before the pandemic. We react, we go ahead on many occasions to the rest of Spain, and they can be sure that we will continue to do so at every moment. But I also say that it will be easier and more effective if coordination at the national level is broad and permanent. Spain has a serious problem if it normalizes that there are only two alternatives to cope with the pandemic: either the sole command of the central government or the absolute decoordination. The communities have our role, and the central government must also assume its role, which is not to centralize everything or to inhibit everything, but to accept that it has its own powers to exercise so that others can also perform those that correspond to us most effectively. The Government of Spain has to lead the response to a pandemic that affects the whole nation, it has to ensure that security forces and bodies ensure compliance with the laws, it has to equip itself with the necessary means and detect whether there are standards to improve; and, of course, coordinate with autonomous communities, with alarm status or without it, on issues that are common. If not, why are there 22 members in the central government?, why are there ministries that manage competences consistent with autonomy?, why is there a social vice-presidency if nothing has to do with residences?, why is there an education ministry if there is no responsibility in school?, why is there a university ministry if there is nothing to say in the organization of higher education?, why is there a territorial policy ministry if there is nothing to coordinate? The State of autonomy is a state, it is not a set of states; therefore, the Central Administration cannot be a mere observer who refrains from acting now. Because that\'s not co-governance, gentlemen, that\'s ingovernance. [[Applause]] With that conviction we will continue to advocate that greater coordination is essential to protect ourselves more and more. And, of course, we will continue to exercise our powers supported by the health emergency decreed on 13 March and since that time it has been fully effective, supported by the response plan to outbreaks that have been operating in Galicia since April, and above all supported by the clinical committee that advises us permanently on the three key action programmes: detection, care and adaptation. And I\'m going to refer to them now. Ladies and gentlemen, we will continue to carry out intense detection work with all the people involved in tracking tasks, with family doctors — who are having a key role in this field — with the members of preventive medicine — who follow the cases at the hospital level — with the teams of the Health Council, the central services and the territorial heads, and announce that with future incorporations, such as those that the Ministry of Defence has made available and that Galicia has already requested. And also with the reinforcement of the structure of the public health department, which requires dimensionalizing and adjusting to the pandemic that we live in. Tests, tests and more tests are the road marked by the World Health Organization and we\'re not going to deviate from it. We were the first community to launch the ""Covid-auto"", we prioritize health professionals, in residences each new incorporation is submitted to a diagnostic test, and we also carry two complete barrels of the 25,000 people who reside in the said residences — and we\'re going to start the third. We also come to the collection of especially exposed groups: the Civil Guard, Civil Protection, children\'s school workers, who today start the course, schools, institutes, pharmacy professionals, local government officials, home help workers, etc. Integration into the Radar Covid App is being promoted and we are waiting for its entry into operation in mid-September. And, above all, before each outbreak, a test strategy was adopted to make early diagnosis, isolate positive and maintain close contacts. We currently do an average of 4,400 daily tests, i.e., 178% more tests — only PCR tests, in addition to complete antibody tests — than we did at the peak of the alarm state. That\'s how we\'re more effective, and that\'s why they\'re detecting more cases. But we want to take one more step. As you know, we have been pioneers in the use of the pooling technique — which currently analyses jointly up to 20 samples and will have the ability to reach 60 joint samples. And we propose that we return to it with a new system of massive tests from saliva samples that are being planned at Vigo hospital and that we hope to consolidate during the month of September. Let each person from his own house collect his own sample, record it through an app and transmit it to be evaluated on robots with the ability to analyze 100,000 tests per month only in this technique. It\'s a qualitative leap to make major assessments, which we\'ll logically prioritize in the health areas and also in large workplaces or affluence. Ladies and gentlemen, in addition to the tests, it is inevitable from a certain point of view to apply restrictions, such as those in force at the moment. In some cases generally for all Galicia and, if necessary, more intensively where there is a greater incidence, as we have done in the areas of Coruña and Lugo in recent weeks. We will take the necessary measures, being aware that no one is infallible and with humility we will also recognize that success in the containment of the first outbreaks — for example, in Barba and the Marine Lighting — will be increasingly difficult if among all we do not reverse the Community transmission that is back in Spain. At this point, I want to send a message of calm to the Greeks: we have a great health system with the ability to pay attention that is needed. As a people we have decided that public health was one of the great collective works in our democracy; as a government, we have improved it in the last legislation; and, as president, health remains my highest and main vocation and commitment. In short, we had a great public health. [[Applause]] We believe it by giving one of the best responses from all Spain in the first wave of the pandemic, and we also prepare it to respond to the second: we maintain the reinforcement of health professionals hired; there are reservations to increase ICUs — and today is only 3.6% of the total available ICU beds in Galicia—; we meet the requirement of hospital beds — still fortunately, currently occupied only at 1.7 per cent —; we count on the TELEA platform to track home patients — we have reached more than 4,300; we have the capacity to lift campaign hospitals if necessary; and there are stock of materials and channels open to acquire what is necessary and we are prepared to intervene the residences that suffer the greatest impact of disease, as we have recently done at Incio. And beyond the timely reinforcement that this crisis compels us, I also want to underline that it remains in force the strategy that we had before the coronavirus for public health. First, because this crisis has shown that it has been a correct investment in health care in recent years and, second, because we also owe it to all the Greeks who suffer from other pathologies that are different from the coward. I would like to tell these patients that they suffer from other pathologies other than the coward-19 that we are aware of what they also suffer, that the management of the pandemic influences on day-to-day hospitals and health centers, and that it would imply for each case that the contaminants are released again and force again to limit the ordinary activity of health centers. Ladies and gentlemen, last year Galicia was the fourth community with the lowest average surgical expectation of the entire national health system. It also recorded a higher surgical performance — almost 40,000 interventions more than the year we did in 2009, 23% more. It improved the rate of consultation, with an average waiting time of 40% lower, and also the effectiveness of primary care, which today derives from hospitals 13% less cases than a decade ago. Thanks to all this, according to the health barometer, the Greeks valued their public health more than ever in history, especially in emergencies and primary care. To keep this data — and more rightly still in a pandemic context — complete the comprehensive renewal of the Galician Health Service will be a top priority in this legislation. It will be at all levels, starting with primary care, because we know that it plays a fundamental role in this crisis and also in a normal situation. [[Applause]] In the same way that in the last eleven years we have built or renewed 74 health centres we will drive those who are missing — other 39 centers — in this legislation. And we will continue to implement the 2019-2021 Primary Care Plan, which is equipped — as you know — with 100 million euros, which has already enabled more stable wage improvements and contracts and which will have the necessary updates to continue to overcome the pandemic. Even so, we will end the impulse given in the last decade to hospital care. Just like we built the new public hospital in Vigo and put it into operation and fully equipped the public hospital in Lugo, we built a new public hospital in Coruña to double its current surface. In the same way that we transformed Ourense\'s public hospital into a new hospital with an income building in the first phase and with the second phase currently underway, we will also transform into a new public hospital in Pontevedra, the Gran Montecelo, the new public hospital in Ferrol — already under construction — and extend, as the commitment, the public hospital in Santiago. In the same way that we have completed the expansion of the public hospital in the Navy and we are pushing its second phase, or equipping the public hospital in Salnes with new surface and new services, we will include new improvements in 100 percent of the city hospitals: in Verín with a new emergency service and CAP; in Monforte with a new day hospital and pharmacy; in the boat we will reform the facade, external consultations, the day hospital or the larger outpatient surgery area; and in both Cee and Barbanza we will end the expansion of the emergency facility. Finally, we will fulfill the word given and this legislation will be that of the completion of a new Galician Health Service. A hundred percent of the Greeks will have a new or renewed public health infrastructure with up-to-date technology. [[Applause]] In addition to completing the health centres and building the new hospitals referred to above, we will continue to incorporate new rights and services, as we have done in previous legislations. Just as we introduced the free choice of doctor, pediatrician, nursing staff and hospital, or access to the second opinion, will include new pathologies in the decree that guarantees maximum waiting times. Just as we have improved the provision of services — for example in hospitals, such as Hemodynamics 24 hours in Lugo and Ourense — in this legislation home hospitalization will reach 100 percent of the Greeks. Just as we set up the rapid pathways for certain diseases, we will now renew all breast cancer diagnostic technology, extend the cervix seizure to all of Galicia, continue to promote colon cancer to achieve more participation and start new ones, such as lung cancer or certain rare diseases. The same way we incorporate new vaccines into the calendar or new treatments, such as hepatitis, we will strengthen the service portfolio of the comarcas hospitals, starting with day-to-day hospital empowerment. Just as in recent years we\'ve been betting on hospitals with more technological means — hybrid chirophanes — now we\'re going to start robotic surgery. And we will bear in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that the pandemic is a damage to the mental health of many people. Therefore, in this legislation, as already committed, we will develop the greatest mental health plan in our history. We will create new units, for example, in the field of child-care, and the Galego Health Service has already planned to hire more than 200 professionals to give better attention to people with mental health problems. Ladies and gentlemen, I mean detection and health care, but, as I told you, we also need to talk about adaptation, about the adaptation we have to make in all areas, and about combining security with activity. For this reason, we have already supported the various sectors to develop appropriate protocols - trade, industry, primary sector, tourism - and we will continue to work with everyone, recognizing that in many cases there are no instructions at national level - which would be advisable - that to comply with the rules requires great effort for the whole world and, of course, that, as we try not always to be right, the revision of the protocols must therefore be constant. Over the past few months, citizens have adapted to their jobs, day by day, to their customs; they have assimilated a new context with a majority responsibility. So we also ask ourselves if our adaptation was complete, if we respond as we were due to the weaknesses that the first few months of the pandemic have left undiscovered. Well, I want to refer to four issues in which I believe we have pending issues: health legislation, health professionals, senior residences and education. After all this time Spain follows exactly the same health legislation as it had before the pandemic. It\'s incomprehensible. You can understand the state of alarm in the beginning because we suddenly faced something new, but it is inexplicable that after these months, with a second wave above us, we continue the same. We\'re talking about new normality, but the mechanism given to us to deal with a situation similar to that of March is still exceptional; it\'s neither new nor normal, because the state of alarm is extraordinary, whether it is requested by the President of the Government or whether we are asked by the autonomous presidents. It\'s essential to ensure agility and legal certainty in outbreak control actions, and there\'s no need if we\'re subject to the criteria and times of each guard trial to make decisions or if the only alternative is that we\'re approving ""an alarm stadiums"" each community with a different criterion. That is why we are in favour of modifying the regulatory framework which governs Spain as a whole and collecting in the homogeneous instruments to make homogeneous decisions, which, logically, each territory must adopt at the appropriate time, but with a common criterion and with a single legislation. Convinced of this, this week we will refer our proposal for organic health law to the President of the Government himself, and we will do so in accordance with my commitment to the Conference of Presidents. I also confirm to you that in this initial period of legislation we will send to this House a reform of the Galician Health Act. They know that so far the updating of autonomous legislation has been impossible, Parliament was dissolved. But, fully recovered from legislative powers, this rule seems to us priority for five reasons: firstly, for greater effectiveness when urgent measures must be taken at all times by ensuring proportionality; secondly, to achieve the maximum of these measures, maintaining, of course, some flexibility in response - for example, we see it appropriate to introduce regulation on mechanisms that have been proven effective, such as the registration of people from other territories in different epidemiological situations -; thirdly, to collect the role of new technologies in the law; fourthly, to clarify the competences of the local and autonomous administration; and fifthly, to update the sanctioning matter and make it consistent with the orders we gave last week in this field. Another issue, in addition to health legislation, is the stability of health professionals. The question of health personnel is shared by all administrations, but I am not sure that we are responding to facts in addition to respect, applause and words. They deserve more stability and that is why we will continue to insist on the central government that it is urgent to eliminate the rate of replenishment in public employment offers for health workers. [[Applause]] It doesn\'t make any sense to continue to ban more professionals than retirees, nor does it make sense that the Administration is obliged to make a multitude of temporary contracts when what it is to avoid them. They also deserve greater reinforcement, because there are key areas in which generational relief should be ensured, such as primary care, pediatrics and mental health - as mentioned -. The number of new doctors who form each course - which also depends on the central government - must ensure the incorporations that are needed in these areas. And thirdly, they deserve more recognition, always, and even more at this moment; so, as far as the future self-government is concerned, we will propose to improve their working conditions in line with their efforts and professionalism. Ladies and gentlemen, the emergency caused by the coward-19 also had a great impact on social services, not only at the human level, but also because it triggered a collective reflection on the future of residences. The situation in Galicia did not reach the extremes at which it was seen in other territories thanks to the anticipation and intensity with which it had been worked since the first time. Before the declaration of the state of alarm and before the Central Government published its criteria, Galicia already had a residency protocol. The health authority has taken care of all residences, both public and private. We strengthened the staff of the residential centres with more than a thousand people, we launched the first integrated residences several days before other communities, which would follow our example, we intervened, as I mentioned earlier, in private residences with a high number of contagions and we have a complete reactivation plan that indicates how visits should be developed, the exits of residences and when and under what circumstances they should be restricted if there are outbreaks. There was less affect and mortality in the Welsh residences than in other parts of Spain, but, of course, we cannot conform because we had to cry too many losses and because the protection of the elderly should be as much as possible always. Our goal is to perfect the response mechanisms in the residences before this or any other emergency, and that\'s why there will be even more health in the residences, because we will approve a protocol of relationship between them and the public health network focused on improving patient follow-up and progress in teleassistion. We will put in place a permanent training plan for the workers of the centres and social services in Galicia, we will address the renewal and technological support of the centres, we will strengthen the inspection, among other measures, and we will develop a new regulation that regulates the conditions for opening and operating the homes of older people. We will continue to do our best, and we will also count on the rigour and professionalism of the workers of these centres. We are aware that the practice of all dependent staff has demonstrated in these months a great commitment and professionalism that deserves all our gratitude. Of course, where bad practices are detected, it is necessary to detect and denounce them, but exceptions cannot disturb the meth and dedication of most. Why? Because it wouldn\'t be fair. [[Applause]] Another idea where adaptation is basic is education. We\'re worried about the start of the course because we\'re talking about the most important thing we have, which is our children, our daughters, the generations that guarantee the country\'s future. Over the past few years, Welsh education has advanced in key areas in which we intend to continue to deepen, overcome sterile struggles and opened public education to multilingualism. Today more than 100,000 students are taught in a third language and we are committed to continuing to increase this number every year. You\'ve seen infrastructure improvements. Since 2009, more than 850 educational centres have been built or renovated, where 220,000 students are studying, and we will continue with the training. There has been a more accessible public education, which we will maintain with more public dining facilities, with the largest school transport network, with help for books and materials and with the lowest university rates in Spain. And there\'s more technology available, since there are over 120,000 students studying in digital classes; targets that, of course, will be strengthened in this legislation. Only in this course will we acquire at least 14,000 new computers. Galicia may be proud of its public education because, in addition, the results believe it can be. In the results of the PISA report, Galician education exceeds the average of Spain and OECD average in all the competencies assessed and there is the lowest drop-out rate in the history of the autonomous community (from 25.8% of school drop-out in 2008 we went to 13.5% in 2018). But, ladies and gentlemen, in addition to pride, I also want Galicia to feel safe and at ease with the education we have given to the boys in this difficult course that will begin and for as long as the pandemic lasts. It\'s normal to face it with concern, too, that marked elections in unheard of conditions and with all the fears that then happened. Finally, I think it has been resolved successfully. Surely zero concern will never be achieved, but families and the rest of the educational community must know that the Union is doing and will do everything in its hand and that at all times the Clinical Committee of the Galician Health Service, which has given one of the best answers to the Spanish pandemic, is working in this area in a special way, in the educational field. That families face the beginning of the course with concern is inevitable, that they do it with confusion is a regrettable fact for which we must apologize and that we must resolve. I do it regardless of who has more or less responsibility because I think the administrations can do it better. Until last week, to the days of the date initially set to start the course, the Interterritorial Council was not held to deal with the common protocol for the opening of the school in Spain. And it seems that finally the Conference of Presidents of this Friday will have education at one point on the agenda. I want to make it clear that I didn\'t feel comfortable in this delay in the preparation of the course, nor do I observe how central government partners go through this matter with each other as if it were a hot potato from which no one wants to take responsibility. But I\'m not going to listen to that either, because the opening of the classes is my job and I\'m worried. The course must begin with maximum certainty, and so Galicia was one of the first communities to count on a proposal for the new course - presented in July -, the first to have instructions adapted to the national protocol agreed throughout Spain last Thursday and also to be adapted to the latest recommendations of the Clinical Committee. In this way, the cloister that is now incorporated into the centers has a roadmap from this day one and, in the same way, for parents to have all the information needed before the course starts, the Education Council will organize telematic meetings with families to explain all the measures directly. Afterwards, the management teams will also have the indication of specificity in each centre. Ladies and gentlemen, the German children will be back to classes step by step because we think that makes it easier for them to adapt to the news that\'s going to happen. They will return to the safe, reorganized classrooms when the distance recommended by the Ministry was not necessary in the current spaces. In these classes they will be professionally subjected to a full-fledged job, as we are performing tests for all the educational staff and for all the staff working in the educational centres, both the public and the concerted. Galicia, which was already the community of all Spain with more teachers per student — 10.5 boys per teacher in front of 12.5 students per teacher in the average of Spain — will add the teachers needed to attend the new school map. And at the disposal of the entire educational community there is a list of preventive measures to comply: firstly, the most important, the requirement of the mask from 6 years old; information on what to do every day before going to school or institute; protection measures such as those relating to classroom ventilation several times a day and the cleaning of the center; as well as double shifts or masks in the dining rooms; scenarios for a possible outbreak situation; and a virtual teaching plan for when these outbreaks occur, because everything indicates that, unfortunately, they will occur. Among all of us, with maximum safety and maximum certainty, we must work to get the course started, because, ladies and gentlemen, children need quality education. Their parents cannot become their only teachers and teachers must be beyond the computer screen. Education, especially in smaller or more difficult situations, will be less education if it is not presentable, because the figure of a teacher in front of his students, the relationship they make personally, is indispensable and irreplaceable. That is why we must aspire to the course to begin, with all concerns and without losing sight of the epidemiological situation, but we must aspire to the course to begin. I understand the concern and share it as a father and as an educator. All sectors felt it, those who never stopped and those who returned to activity. They all answered with great professionalism, and that\'s why we must not accept that no one questions or tries to boycott the teachers and the rest of the educational workers. [[Applause]] Just like the staff of hospitals - especially those of emergency, infectious and critical units - adapted their service, in which thousands of people enter every day, like the workers of supermarkets, who live with thousands of citizens who buy near them, like those responsible for opening up tourist establishments in security conditions in which citizens enjoyed their vacations, like the workers of small, medium and large businesses that every day perform their duties, the educational community must also resume the course with the rhythm that the health authority advises, with the greatest responsibility, knowing that the zero risk, unfortunately, does not exist, and with all the vocation of giving our children the best training. I\'m convinced the educational community will do it well, and it will do it well, as always. Ladies and gentlemen, the course begins with all guarantees is essential for no minor reasons; it is essential to preserve the quality of our children\'s training, and for more reason in the case of disadvantaged families. We cannot forget in education and in all the fields that Galicia must emerge from this more coherent crisis, no less, more solidarity, not less, more equitable, not less. During the first weeks of the health emergency, Galicia unveiled a social plan of continence to support families who have to live on the day and who were the ones who suffered the most impact of the first uncertainties; it shifted to the maximum that allows the law to access Risga so that more than 1,600 people were new beneficiaries of the Risga - i.e., 15% more than they had previously received it - provided home care, 100 percent free of charge, over 3,000 older people and expanded the service of Eating at home to reach 1,700 new Galicians who live alone - increasing more than 20% - ; and they gave help to about 60,000 families, with a school lunch bag, both for children\'s schools and institutes during the pandemic. In this way, we managed to soften the first blow of the pandemic, along with the commitment they showed hundreds and hundreds of Greeks from administrations, from NGOs or individually to care for the most vulnerable people. The exemplary behaviour of Galician society inspired us to put in place a social recovery plan that is still in place today with 60 million euros. For 1,200 families with no incomes or very low incomes, we gave a basic card of between 450 and 900 euros to acquire first-needed products, in addition to a 50% increase in the share of social inclusion aid. For families with children or dependents in charge, we offered just fines Special Care, with 500 euros a month to hire home care, which have already requested more than 1,800 families; for 730 families with minors in foster care, we increased their remuneration by 25%; for vulnerable children, two new protection centres; and to ensure continuity of fundamental social services, such as child schools and day centres, extraordinary lines of help to compensate for the time they had to remain with their suspended activity. Ladies and gentlemen, we also bear in mind that the fight against masculine violence cannot be neglected at any time. We haven\'t done it in the last few years and that\'s why we\'ve kept regular support and guaranteed support in psychological, judicial or counseling during the pandemic. At the exceptional time of the alarm state we put in place a victim\'s relief plan. And we will continue to work in this legislation, for example, by creating 4 public ownership information centres to improve and coordinate the 82 that exist at the municipal level and also by encouraging them to continue to reach the rural area. The path to Galicia of well-being also goes by bringing to all families the resources to live as dignified as possible. In the past eleven years, our community has doubled funds for the fight against poverty. Thanks to that, and to the legislative improvements, like the new Risga decree, the security network that assists the most vulnerable families is stronger today than it was eleven years ago. Now, this can\'t lead to conformism. The consequences of the pandemic will strain our social fabric and we must be prepared to react, resource-based, normatively-ready and politically-ready. The fight against poverty must be based on consensus in this legislation and not on dissensuals. [[Applause]] In an area where it is difficult to dissociate the autonomous competences of municipalities, coordination is capital. In the last few months, we have shown that it works this way, in addition to desirable, it is perfectly possible. I have nothing but praise for the work of the Greek municipalities, for the vast majority of them. It must continue to be like this. I have always defended from this forum that collaboration allows to exercise more widely, efficiently and correctly the functions that we have assigned, so I am sad to read information that points to the fact that the Minimal Vital Income is not being dealt with with with in the agility that is currently required. According to the data we have, only 0.5% of the people who apply for it are accessing the Minimum Vital Income. Still counting on families you\'ve already granted automatically, this benefit is reaching less than 10% of your potential beneficiaries. The serious bureaucratic impasse we are living in can be a sign of the effectiveness of a measure that the Government has announced as historic and that it could be if it had been put into practice properly. I\'m not going to remember the warnings we made to most autonomic managers or most NGOs about the ways in which it was negotiated and approved the measure and the method of management that was selected. If I would like to move forward the position that the Galician Council will maintain if this House gives me confidence to be its president. First, our community will continue to demand the management of the Minimal Vital Income. As I\'ve moved several times to the President of the Central Government, after thirty years of dealing with Risk, the Autonomic Administration has the professionals and the experience necessary for this benefit to arrive as best as possible to the people who need it. Neither the majority of the Greeks nor myself understand the reasons why some communities have already been committed to managing this help and others have denied us, even if the paralysis is such that when three months are completed from the publication of the Minimum Vital Income in the Official State Gazette, they were not even satisfied with the management order to the two communities -- two single communities -- that, according to the Government, they were worthy of doing so. Secondly, and in parallel to a claim that we believe fair - the direct management of this income by the autonomous communities - Galicia will design the mechanism for a part of the risk budget to be directed towards complementing the Minimal Vital Income, ensuring that it is, yes, linked to the socio-laboral insertion of people who perceive it. Our community will also be looking after those people who are in a more extreme situation. We will continue to work to avoid evictions and facilitate housing alternatives to the people who suffer them. In addition, in this legislation, the measures collected in the Home Care Plan will be developed, which particularly affect access to housing. We have the conviction that having a roof is the best way to start a social inclusion process. We are aware of the difficulties of many Greeks, especially the younger, to access a home. It can get worse in the current context, and that is why we will continue to prioritize this task: through the Social Rental Bond, which during the pandemic is covering 100 per cent of the income with the money of all the Greeks through the budget of the Union; with new aid for the acquisition of protected housing, both new and rehabilitated, from up to 20,000 euros for families with less income; encouraging the emancipation of young people with a rental program with a choice of purchase; and also promoting the mobilization of empty housing, a goal in which we have worked a lot over the last few years. More than 33,000 families in Galicia have help from the Board for Rent or Rehabilitation, and our goal is that there will be more and more, because having a decent housing is a key goal for anyone. Of course, under no circumstances can the constitutional right to housing be exercised in collision with the freedom or property of other Greeks. Like most citizens, we are concerned about the illegal occupation of housing; it damages the coexistence and attention to the values that make us strong as a society, and, like the rest of Spain, it is growing worryingly, so it must be reacted at the national level with speed and consistency, changing the appropriate legal regulations. [[Applause]] The difficult weeks in which Spain has been confined made us appreciate more, if any, the importance of having a home in condition. But our thought was also with those who have a home but not with whom to share it. Older people living alone need support, companionship and affection. To get you closer, we have the home aid service, which, after these eleven years, reaches 16 times more homes than before. Dinner at home or the teleassistation service, too. We\'ll still be next to him. In the coming months we will present the strategy of attention to unwanted loneliness, which will identify this problem and propose measures to solve it. It will also be reopened with all health guarantees or the door-to-door care bus, which in 2019 has travelled 20 municipalities and will lead to 200 municipalities optical services, podology, cognitive stimulation, etc. I have the conviction that older people must be active subjects, not passive, of this society. His voice must be heard with attention, appreciated and respected. The older Greeks have the right to decide how they want to grow up. From this philosophy we will extend a pioneering initiative like the homes of the largest, which in this legislation will reach 100 percent of the municipalities of less than 5,000 inhabitants. The first 30 are already in operation and the order has been launched for another 30 houses of the largest. We will also strengthen the public network of older residences for those people who, because of their degree of dependence, need more intensive support. In the first half of this Galician legislation there will be seven of Europe\'s best residences, which we project with the financing of the Amancio Ortega Foundation in the main cities of Galicia, and will complement with more public squares in those areas where there is a greater demand. If in these eleven years we can increase by 44% the number of squares available to the most dependent people, up to 2024 we plan to rise this percentage to 80%, creating 2,000 more squares. [[Applause]] But all this, naturally, we can\'t do it alone. The financing of the dependency care system cannot almost exclusively lie on the shoulders of the autonomous communities. Of the EUR 383 million that Galicia is intended to care for dependents, three-quarters come from the Autonomous Community, contradicting the law, which establishes a 50-50 breakdown. Since 2009, investment in dependency on Union has increased by 95% and state funds by 24%. I hope this is the legislation in which the Central Government pays this debt to the biggest and disabled people in Galicia. That doesn\'t mean, ladies and gentlemen, that in our community we don\'t have any pending matters. Despite the sharp increase in public squares, despite the impulse to work integration of people with disabilities, despite improvements in accessibility, there is still room for improvement. Many people spend too much time waiting for their degree of dependency or disability, a situation that was accentuated during the pandemic. For them, we commit ourselves to speeding up and simplifying the processes necessary to access public services and services. In this same line, in the near future, we\'ll have a useful tool for people with disabilities to access a centre that meets their needs and preferences. I\'m talking about the decree of the social concert, which is already being processed and we hope you\'ll soon see the light. Let me also reiterate my commitment to justice, a service that is also being strongly pressed at the root of the pandemic. It is a priority for the Central Government to develop a plan for the reactivation of judicial bodies successfully and with sufficient funds. It has all the support of the Galician Union. For our part, we do not give up continuing to complete neither the technological renewal nor the completion of the judicial infrastructures that we need. In fact, in the same way that in recent years we have invested 100 million euros in technological renewal and infrastructure in the cities of Ourense, La Coruña, Santiago and Ferrol, which have new judgments available, we will continue to work and, for example, we will end the City of Justice of Vigo, the largest judicial work ever done in the history of Galicia. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, there are and there will be difficulties that we must protect because the economic situation is very complex. We are already suffering the consequences of the pandemic, like the rest of communities and countries. To this is the uncertainty about the outbreaks, and the effects of the measures to be taken to contain them. And in our case there are also the worrying forecasts for Spain, which point to the greatest fall in the gross domestic product of the European environment, unprecedented in our history. We must accept it realistically because this is basic in order to be able to anticipate, without passively waiting for events. And we must face it with hope because we are past moments of recession before. If Galicia is the second largest community per capita GDP in the last decade, it has reached the highest convergence in income with Spain in the historical series, struck export records until the pandemic arrived, reduced the unemployment rate of 12.6% that we found in 2009 to 11.95% today or changed the course of sectors that were falling, such as the naval or the automobile, if we were able to achieve this, it is because as the people were able to reverse the fundamental crisis that also marked an investment session like this in the first of my legislations. That experience must move us. There are also places of hope at present where we can support ourselves to meet the present challenge. For example, GDP drop data - although very hard - reveal at the moment a better behaviour of Galicia than the rest of Spain. In Galicia GDP falls 14.5% and in the rest of Spain 18.5%. Employment destroyed in the second quarter is recovering at the highest rate than the national average. In Galicia, 81.85 % is recovered from 31% of the state. And the same thing happens with ERTE. Galicia was the fifth community where the number of workers fell faster in this situation, with an intensity of eight points higher than the set of Spain. And in addition to data, we also have our collective strength. Like I said, I\'m counting on all the groups of this camera. If every day Germans who were voters of the Socialist Party or the Nationalist Block or the People\'s Party of Galicia work and fight together, we also have to add efforts in search of realistic responses to the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. The reaction will also be more appropriate if we continue to count on the productive fabric, with its vision and experience, as we did in Galicia when we set up the Committee of Economic Experts. I want to thank all your members for their willingness and transfer them as well that their service to Galicia is not over. We\'ll still need them. And, of course, social dialogue. Social dialogue is a key tool for drawing up measures that bridge the current situation and drive the path of growth. Social dialogue proved very useful to take the first steps during the pandemic. For example, in the Galician social dialogue he agreed and managed to be one of the first communities to make it easier for workers affected by an ERTE to charge an advance on his payroll when the government had not yet entered it. For example, in the social dialogue we act as aids to complete the minor benefits of workers affected by temporary employment regulation records and for people from 50 to five years who have lost their jobs. For example, in social dialogue we have done a new digital training programme aimed at unemployed people over forty-five years of age. And also in the social dialogue during the pandemic, we approved a package of extraordinary conciliation measures to help families, including surpluses and day-to-day reductions by care of minors or older. All of them - yet - are initiatives that emerged in the midst of social dialogue during the months of the first wave. That\'s why my intention is to strengthen the conciliation framework we already had. I announce that my first decision together with the appointment of the new government will be the call of the Social Dialogue Bureau, precisely to draw together methods and objectives. [[Applause]] Methods and targets to alleviate the crisis, but also to get strengthened out of it and design Galicia in 2030, supported by four axes where we\'ve been working as you know: a more familiar Galicia, a greener Galicia, a more innovative Galicia and an open Galicia. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not hide that a determining obstacle to coping with the future is the uncertainty we have about public accounts. Galicia had until the arrival of the vault-19 a healthy financial situation. We\'ve been able to maintain self-government. We don\'t need any help involving the loss of control or intervention of our autonomous farm. We have been the Community which has increased public debt the least since 2008 and which it now pays its suppliers the best. That data, which, of course, we continue to aspire to, is now overcome by a limited number of unknowns about the financial situation that we have in our communities and that we must dissipate as soon as possible. Since this crisis began, most autonomic presidents have called for the holding of a Fiscal and Financial Policy Council. None have been celebrated. And it\'s essential because autonomy, which we\'re assuming important tensions in order to meet the skills we have, we need answers and decisions. As is the case with improving the functioning of the Conference of Presidents, so that it will be useful and truly an area of agreement. First of all, we need to talk again about the €16 billion fund that is qualified to meet this year\'s expenditure, because it is proving insufficient. But in addition, we remain absolutely opposed to the criteria set out by the Government, which in the case of Galicia only in the first instalment of this fund loses EUR 83 million in relation to the percentage that would correspond to the current financing system. Secondly, we disagreed that the social area had been eliminated from the bottom, although Galicia had already provided for seventy-six million and a half resources in the social area, while the Government had sent only 18.9 million, and 43% of them to the municipalities. And thirdly, because it must continue this year 2021. There are costs that will be structural for several years - in health and in education especially - and for this reason the Government should enable a similar fund sufficiently endowed for the year 2021, the covered fund 2021. Within the restriction of uncertainties, second financial necessity: the central government continues to do not outrun the 370 million it owes to Galicia, as well as to the rest of the autonomous communities, for the monthlyity of the VAT it is unpaid and for the incentives for compliance with the tax targets, which since 2017 remains unpaid. Third. The finalist funds for employment were also not transferred, funds that just confiscated us, and that in the case of Galicia amounts to 100 million euros. We continue to demand access to them. The logic would be to expand them into a new socio-laboral reality that recommends strengthening active employment policies. Fourth. We still have no information to draw up next year\'s budgets, which at the moment - as you all know - should be in the process of drawing up. We don\'t have any information. We don\'t know, we don\'t know the expenditure ceiling, the forecasts, the advances on the account, the public deficit targets, the percentage of the debt allowed, that is, we don\'t know anything. Fifth. We disagree with the agreement reached with the Presidency of the Spanish Federation of Municipalities — against all parties, except the Socialist Party — regarding the surplus of the municipalities, which corresponds to the neighbours of each municipality. And sixth place, very important. The situation in Galicia with regard to European funds needs to be clarified. The agreement reached by Spain at European level meant, with the current procedure, a loss of 40% of the European funds over the previous Community period. Which, of course, you will understand that we cannot accept. I have already asked the President of the Government to reconsider at national level because it is essential that we prepare the future with a minimum of economic and budgetary planning. Seventh place. We\'ve been complaining for years since June that the fund-sharing system, which was born ejaculated, is being updated. It goes through a reform or updating of the system of self-financing that can no longer be postponed and that we should negotiate between all of us, thinking more about people and less about territories. And, eighthly, we must enable a system to ensure that communities participate in the management of the recovery fund approved by the European Union, which I shall return to. In addition to the financial situation of administrations, it is very important that we do not aggravate the problems we already have. It would be totally incompatible to talk about reconstruction and, at the same time, let go of companies that make up thousands of jobs. [[Applause]] The central government must put an end to the uncertainties generated in the industry settled on the coast with a new law of back that gives rise to consensus and the defence of employment; also of the jobs which it guarantees to Ence for five thousand families directly and eighty thousand families who live in wood. It must look for alternatives that guarantee an industrial future for districts dependent on Meirama and The Bridges. Sail through the future of Navantia, especially to cover the void that is due to the delay in the construction of the frigates. To guarantee an electric price that brings stability to the intensive industry, so that it can compete on equal terms with the rest of Europe and because five thousand families in Galicia depend on the energy price for the intensive industry. And it must be involved in materializing the viable and stable solution for Alcoa. There\'s an option. And we also have the word that the President of the Government gave me personally. Of course, I believe in that word and I will work with it to achieve the goal that we all share: to keep industrial activity in the Navy shining and saving thousands of jobs at stake. [[Applause]] Among all of us we must create an enabling climate so that the economy can cope with the present moment, and of course Union too. With this conviction we approved in June the Reactivation and dynamisation Plan, with EUR 3,043 million of public-private investment. And as we have already done, we will bring it to the committee which is set up in this Parliament to further strengthen a package of measures in three areas: measures to deal with shock, measures to encourage reactivation and measures to accelerate economic transformation. Logically, the most urgent thing is to deal with the initial shock. And that\'s why we\'ve reached all the funding mechanisms within our reach for industry and the rest of the productive tissue. For example: tax holidays in Greece until November 2020, acquiesces of the depreciation quotas of the first half of the loans of Igape and XesGalice, agile payment to suppliers, loans of up to 200,000 euros that already benefited 2,200 companies and microcredits with which we credited 100 percent of the interest to small entrepreneurs and self-employed, and Igape Reply became a single window to advise entrepreneurs; all possible, ultimately, to provide liquidity and support the maintenance of the activity, because that was the first. In a second phase, we also assume our responsibility to contribute to reactivation. For example, we recovered the 100 percent of the public work that was being carried out in Galicia prior to the state of alarm — the first autonomous community that recovered the entire public work, with 508 works that are supposed to maintain 5,300 jobs — we made the conditions of access to the business soil owned by the Galician Union flexible, we approved new lines of funding to help companies reinvent themselves in a new context where almost nothing is like before — the transformation and digitization of commercial spaces is perhaps one of the most illustrative and successful examples of this – we helped to generate a copper material industry in Galicia with nearly 12 million euros which, for example, enabled a capacity to manufacture about one million masks every day in Galicia. Let me refer at this point to the people and sectors who are particularly affected by the crisis. Logically the people most punished by the crisis are the unemployed, or those people who see their work and income reduced. It is necessary to give them specific answers and that is why we redefine a new employment agenda that plans to mobilise more than 225 million euros and benefit more than 65,000 unemployed Greeks. We address the main challenges that must be faced in the labour market, which must be prepared for the technological transformation of businesses and self-employed people and facilitate the coexistence of different forms of work — present and telework —. The crisis is also not affecting all sectors in the same way, and we need to be fully aware that hospitality, tourism, the leisure and party sector or street sales are suffering very much. I appreciate everyone\'s collaboration in a moment of great uncertainty for them. Decisions such as the closure of night leisure establishments are necessary at certain times to contain the progress of the pandemic, but logically they have economic consequences to take into account. In this sense, we will continue to work together with the sector in a reactivation protocol for when the health situation allows the gradual reopening of the premises and funding to which they can access. I also want to acknowledge the efforts of the whole tourist sector in preparing for the summer campaign, which we are trying to contribute to a shock plan of EUR 58 million and of which 75% of the measures are under way. Galicia comes to months of holidays with the most done duties and that\'s what we\'re in between communities with the best tourist results. And with that impulse we will continue to work to resist but also to move forward. Because this crisis — I told you — also calls us in the medium and long term and puts before us the challenge of coping with the transformation in which we were already immersed but that we need to accelerate. First, the transformation to an open Galicia. We were already on our way to an open Galicia driven by a successful tourist model and the horizon of a decade that will celebrate three Jacobs. Over the past few years, we have increased by more than one million the figure of annual tourists, we have grown by all variables, we have consolidated a new tourism model that is more decentralized and more deseasonated, we have doubled the number of foreign tourists. It\'s true that the pandemic has profoundly transformed our reality, so it\'s essential to reformulate Xacobeo. And we\'re doing it just four months from the start and thanks to the advanced work, which allowed us to have a proposal and a very early diagnosis. The Jacobean decade that we are about to begin must be, beyond a celebration, an economic tool in which we must try to support ourselves. In the tourism field it will be a competitive advantage at a time when all destinations seek to reinvent themselves and adapt to a new scenario of uncertainties. In Galicia we started a world-renowned event that has been promoting the values that all today seek for their destiny — not only in the tourism field, but also in the cultural field. In the cultural field it must be a revolutionary for our creators to resume their activity, an event that promotes the design of products and formats and encourages demand to build and consolidate country projects in the long term. After a collective impact as deep as the one suffered during these months, Jacob may be — and we are going to work for it — a support for not only economic recovery but also emotional recovery from the Greek people. [[Applause]] Transformation, secondly, towards an innovative Galician. Ladies and gentlemen, we must also keep moving towards that most innovative Galicia. That doesn\'t mean giving up what we already are, because the strategic sectors of our economy are called on to follow it. We do not give up being leaders in the fisheries sector, but we must continue to be innovative in responding to the challenges of marketing and ensuring more sustainable new work formulas. In this sense, they\'re ready to walk in the first shells of the legislate, the Marisqueo Action Plan and the Handicraft Coastal Fishing Action Plan. We will also pay attention to the consequences Brexit has in such areas as this. We also do not give up many of the Greeks still living from the countryside, but we must continue to innovate to move forward in their modernization, to continue attracting projects for the transformation of the dairy sector and to continue to increase ecological agriculture. We don\'t give up our historic industries, like naval and automotive, and we\'re going to keep innovating and continuing the bet decided by their modernization. And we don\'t give up gambling for new sectors without tradition in our economic history, but with special growth potential, such as aeronautical or biotechnological, because that\'s also innovating. But, in addition to our own conviction, we are forced to follow that path of innovation because the European Union is going around too. In this sense, the fund enabled at Community level is a window of opportunity that we cannot take advantage of. And that\'s why it will continue to be a priority for us to support tool pemmes 4.0 and the industry in the betting by the smart factory; also that advanced manufacturing centres continue with the first ones that are already approved, such as the ICT of the Crown, and continue to accompany entrepreneurs in the marketing of innovative solutions to the vault, as we have come in these months; and of course by supporting Galicia innovative in digitization, which in this context is absolutely essential. Thirdly, the transformation to the green Galicia. The European reconstruction fund also reinforces our commitment by the Green Galicia, calling on us to deepen the challenge of the sustainable economy. And Galicia is in it too. We will continue to bet on a strategic sector for our economy as the forest, and in particular we will launch the line ""Use wood"" to encourage construction or rehabilitation from this material. Also due to the growth of renewable energies. Galicia is the second autonomous community with the highest renewable power, with production equivalent to 88% of our total consumption, and we will continue to work on its impulse because we want this percentage to reach 100 percent. We are finally called upon to accelerate economic transformation, and Galicia is ready. In fact, as I told you, we have already asked the Central Government to involve the communities in the plans for investments and reforms it is developing, and this Friday I will ask again at the Conference of Presidents. We must sit down so that in the autumn we can bring Europe a plan agreed upon by all. Of course, Galicia is willing and has already designed the first tractor projects, which, in our view, fit perfectly into the philosophy of the European fund: the installation of a green hydrogen production plant, the establishment of a centre for the impulse of the circular economy and the creation of a sustainable textile fibre manufacturing centre from the cellulose wood soluble that allows a strategic sector to be diversifyed for Galicia. It\'s three tractor projects we\'ve been working on for months. Ladies and gentlemen, only these three projects are worth more than EUR 1 billion investment, but our commitment is to continue with additional initiatives, which we will design with experts and with the most innovative sectors. That\'s our goal, because they fit into the bet for making a planned, orderly, fair energy transition. The ecological transition we would like to agree with the Central Government, rather than relying on closed doctrinal criteria, should be supported in reality. This reality is defined by regions in need of industrial reactivation, well-qualified workers and professionals and by industries that require gradual change and adaptation. We\'re not original at this point. Europe, without partisan distinction, follows this path which, for difficult reasons to understand, the Government of the nation of the moment has come to an end. Ladies and gentlemen, it is unquestionable that the arrival of this pandemic disrupted Galician plans as in the world. The families have reordained their habits and the institutions of our community have not been linked to this collective reorientation. In these months, the emergencies of the Government of Greece have changed, but not our commitments to citizenship, because our commitments to citizenship remain and will be fixed in the strategic plan that we are working on. The decisions we make and we will make to fight the pandemic will leave a cement in our community. Our job is to ensure that on that cement we can continue to build the Galicia we want and that we\'ve been working for so many years. In this dark age it is difficult to look away, forward, but it is our duty to do so. When we overcome this situation together, which we will overcome, we cannot and must not find ourselves in the open without a plan that guides our steps. Before this crisis Galicia had shared goals, common goals and consensus routes to achieve them. We may have to change the travel plan, but of course we\'re not going to give up the fate we set ourselves. [[Applause]] The first of them, the first of the challenges we cannot renounce, is the demographic future. It\'s not that this demographic problem is a new issue. Today there is a broad consensus that demography must be at the top of the agenda of European governments\' priorities. I trust that this collective feeling is reflected in this House, which will be an opportunity to demonstrate throughout this legislation. The Board approved this year the Galician Demographic Impulse Bill, a pioneering text not only in our community but at the national level. One of the first decisions to be taken by the next Government will be referred to this Parliament to discuss, enrich and give it a final green light. To address this issue with rigour, with the rigour we need, we must avoid falling into simplism, not just a cultural issue, not just an economic problem, not just a problem of conciliation, not just a problem of personal preferences, it is a combination of all these factors that any demographic policy must take into account to be effective. In that line are the measures the Demographic Impulse Act collects, some of which are already in force. In the week when the little ones in the house — today — start to re-enter the classroom, it is obliged to remember that the Greek families are the only ones in Spain who have a totally free childhood education for the second and second children. [[Applause]] The freeness of education for more than twelve thousand children is not an isolated decision. This is from the logical continuation to eleven years in which childhood education has lived in Galicia an unprecedented stage of expansion, with twice as many public squares, with new aids and new conciliation instruments as the children\'s homes in rural areas. Over the next few years, we will be building on the reconciliation beyond the limits of the children\'s school with funds so that companies can set up childcare services, with more support to hire kangaroos and a special reflection on schedules and flexibility, which is a matter that confinement has once again become a matter of great urgency. In addition to the conciliation measures, in these years we have also addressed households with children more economic aid than ever before. Since 2016 we have distributed 60,000 Welcome cards, with an economic contribution of seventy million euros for the benefit of families who have a child or a daughter. In this legislation that will begin, Galicia will again be at the forefront of family support policies, equating, for the purposes of income tax, single-parent homes or with two children to numerous families, and granting them a bonus of EUR 250 for each child from the third. Naturally, families with three or more children will continue to count on the unconditional support of this government. For them, as we compromise during the campaign, we are already very advanced in drafting the Plan of Support for Many Families, which will see the light before the end of this year 2020. Within this package of measures, these homes with numerous families may find, for example, discounts on all the rates of motorways of autonomous ownership, specific support for the numerous families of special type with five or more children, or reduced prices in the parking lot of the hospitals or other centers of Junta de Galicia. But demography embraces much more than policies of reconciliation and support for families; it is also the fixation and attraction of new population, territorial balance and equality, and it is policies for the younger and the older. Galicia of the future must present new opportunities for youth, and it is essential that they continue to have adequate training for present and future needs. Opportunities such as those guaranteed with the highest wager for vocational training, which today with 50% more enrolled and increasingly dual vocational training, and as well as those that guarantee universities through the renewal of the Title Map they are doing. Opportunities for both the boys who were born here and those who came from outside. Ladies and gentlemen, it\'s more and more people who want to settle down on our land. So in 2019 we were able to grow timidly in population for the first time in ten years. But since 2009 they have entered Galicia 46,661 more people than they have left. And, of course, our doors remain open to all those who want to come back, especially thinking of the second and third generation Greeks, who are living at a very difficult time in most Latin American countries. The Galicia of the future must bet on active aging, because our older ones are still having a lot to say and get closer. Galicia of the future must continue to take equal steps, because it is much that has advanced in this matter, but it must continue to move forward so that remains of machismo on our land. Galicia of the future must deepen in cohesion, so that opportunities do not depend on the place of our community where they live. The gap that still exists between rural Galicia and cities will continue to be reduced during this legislation. That\'s why we need to move forward in the allocation of infrastructure that reduces the time needed to move within our community. The same commitment that made it possible to renew the public transport lines and ensure that it is free for all under twenty-one years of age in all public transport lines in Galicia. The same commitment that made 80% of the Greeks already have less than fifteen minutes in our house a high-capacity track, which will also ensure that new progress is made. I\'m talking about intermodality, which in this legislation may begin to take advantage of many Greeks; I\'m talking about road infrastructures, where we will continue to work and, of course, the arrival of the high-speed train. There can be no more excuses — I suppose —. Galicia will not allow further delays in delays, nor any more breaches of non-compliances. We want a definitive calendar now. I don\'t think that\'s much to ask. [[Applause]] We are also very aware that, at the gates of the third decade of the 21st century, some of the most important infrastructures are not dedicated to people\'s mobility. In Galicia\'s ""debe"" there is still mobile connectivity in certain rural areas, something that poses major difficulties for its neighbours at the time, for example, of teleworking. To remedy it, Junta will lead and continue to lead efforts to improve coverage in areas where operators do not plan to do so. Because a vertebrate Galicia must necessarily guarantee decent Internet access at any point in our territory. The improvement of infrastructure is one of the fundamental tools to improve the vertebration of our community, but it\'s not the only one. In the last decade, an important policy effort has been made to move forward towards a more orderly territory, in which we will persist in the first stages of this legislation with two very ambitious laws. The historical problem of land ownership in rural will be addressed in the new law of recovery and value of Galician land, which will help identify abandoned land whose owners are unknown or imlocalizable and mobilize them to make them productive. And the land management regulations — the second law — will take a new step towards rationalizing them with a new law on this matter, which will make the procedures more simple and agile for the implementation of projects of strategic interest, whenever all legal and environmental guarantees are complied with. The urban situation of many small municipalities will also be clarified thanks to the municipal basic plans, and about thirty municipalities will modernise their urbanism with the approval of the new general municipal management plans. Sorting instruments should not pose unwarranted obstacles to projects that the Greeks want to develop, but on the contrary. The regulations we\'ve been developing for years consolidates a more vertebrate territory, which combines the harmonisation of individual initiatives and businesses with the necessary protection of one of the most valuable goods we have: our landscape. Galicia has been betting on a development model that is compatible with the protection of the natural environment and the future of the planet. My proposal for next legislation goes through the circular economy, more rational waste management and historical reform in water resources management through the creation of the Water Sogama. [[Applause]] Galicia will also put its big sand to mitigate the causes of climate change and mitigate its consequences by developing the approved strategy last year. Our community, which is already a reference to renewable energy, will continue to work to reduce emissions. We will do so — yes - as we believe it is necessary to do: progressively, rationally and always looking for alternatives to the maintenance and development of the productive tissue. Responsibly taking advantage of Galicia\'s rich natural heritage is the best way to respect it. Making use of it and promoting its permeability with Greek society is the most effective way to preserve it. Over the next few years, we\'re going to favour that the Greeks, especially the younger ones, know our natural parks better. In parallel, we will continue to work on the Greek candidatures to the heritage of humanity. Atlantic Islands, the Iron of Illustration and the Sacred River are three jewels that we will leave our children and grandchildren with a recognition, a prestige and a state of conservation better than what we find ourselves. We will also continue the bet determined by the recovery of our urban heritage. In addition to boosting the rehabilitation of about 3,000 homes, mostly in historic helmets, in the wake of Rexurbe areas, we will launch a specific line of help so that owners with less resources can finish the buildings that have unfinished, respecting the indications of the Guide to Colors and Materials. Galicia of the future must love herself more, give more value to what is ours. That includes continuing to defend our language to open it to all ages, especially to young people, to all fields, such as economics, and sister languages, through the Lusophony. It also includes, of course, the talent of our creators. That\'s the purpose of the Strategy of Greek culture, which we have just premiered and includes more than 300 measures to support the key sector of our land. Ladies and gentlemen, the urgent can\'t make us forget what\'s important too. So these future structural challenges must continue to concentrate a part of government action in a variable proportion as the pandemic evolves. Ladies and gentlemen, for your immediate and not so immediate future, the Greek people have just issued an eloquent warrant in the polls. It makes this parliament composed of three forces, while it places positions outside the House which, in our view, are extremes of one sign or another, reaffirms the pluralism of our own land and facilitates the possibility of understanding us. The Greeks were called to the polls in a special social, economic and health situation, and I think they sent us a message according to the times in which we live. We can\'t ignore that call. They told us that Galician democracy is still standing, that they want stability, and they asked for a moderate response that demands from all of us an effort to get closer. That is why, as a candidate for this investment and, in principle, I hope it will be confirmed, with even greater support than on the previous three occasions which I have had in a debate like this, I would like to tell you that I am counting on all the Members and Members who are here today. For me, most of the people that the Greeks gave in the polls are not an exclusive mandate, but an inclusive mandate. I hope that the answer we have to give to the challenges and difficulties we face is not only that of a Union that has more support from citizens than in previous legislations, but that may be the answer from all Galicia to all of Galicia. [[Applause]] In recent years, in crises initiated, in the midst of crises and overrun crises, the Greeks have persisted in their way of being. They want to live in a united and focused land only as they move forward. The Greeks are like this, we are like this, we want to continue to be like this. I am a lawyer for not importing struggles that undermine the coexistence we have given ourselves through the Spanish Constitution and the Statute for the Autonomy of Galicia. I advocate asking each day in every decision and in every project: what unites the Greeks more?, what makes them free?, what makes them more equal? I advocate managing real problems — which are already enough — instead of adding other preventable and indispensable and artificial problems. And that\'s why I\'m here and I\'m asking for the support of this parliament. I request the support of this chamber so Galicia progresses undivided and united. [[Applause]] I request the support of this chamber so that the general interest always prevails over children\'s interests. I call for the support of this chamber to defend the priorities of the Greeks: health, employment, economic recovery and well-being. [[Applause]] I request the support of this chamber so that Galicia will continue to respond to the pandemic with the sentiño that characterizes us. I request the support of this chamber to work on the emergencies that generated this crisis, but without forgetting that there are goals, challenges and dreams to which Galicia should not give up. I request the support of this chamber for a Galician who acts like a family where we support each other, for a green Galician who takes care of herself, for an innovative Galician able to anticipate the future, for a Galician who trusts the young and their own future and for a Galician who, with all concerns, affirms that she can maintain confidence. I ask for the support of this chamber aware of the difficulties we have in the future, but also in the hope that gives me experience. I am convinced that Galicia will be able, as we have done at other times in our history. [[Applause]] Ladies and gentlemen, today\'s legislation is that of the coronavirus, but I\'ll put everything out of myself to end by being the legislating of understanding and the legislating of recovery, the legislating in which Galicia was able to overcome itself again. Galegos and Galicians, I\'m at your service. Thank you very much.']","<|system|>

I would also like to thank the Enhedslisten for taking the initiative in this debate on climate policy. It has been quite a short time since COP21 in Paris ended and it has been a great experience to participate in this great and complicated negotiation work. I would also like to thank the many climate and energy rapporteurs of the Danish Parliament who passed Paris. Thank you for your cooperation in this regard. The global climate agreement underlines that there is global support for tackling climate change, and I am proud that Denmark, as part of the EU, contributed with one of the highest reduction targets. Similarly, the global climate agreement shows the importance of Denmark actively contributing to achieving and fulfilling international climate agreements both within the UN and within the EU. It is these binding agreements that are the tool to track the countries of the world on the right path in dealing with global climate challenges. In Denmark, a large part of the debate on climate change during the autumn has been marked by debates on the advantages and disadvantages of setting a separate Danish reduction target by 2020, which goes beyond the ambitious target that Denmark has already committed itself to achieving as part of the EU's overall climate targets by 2020 and 2030. The government's position on this debate is clear: we do not want to set a short-term national reduction target that goes beyond EU objectives. There are a number of good reasons for this. The government's long-term goal is that we should be independent of fossil fuels by 2050. A national milestone in the climate area by 2020 is not necessarily a cost-effective stepping stone on its way. This is due to the fact that it is currently difficult to establish the optimal route of reduction on the short track due to inter alia: the development of technology. In addition, emissions levels in the short term will also be guided by temporary fluctuations in fuel prices, CO2 A national target by 2020 can thus lead to too fast and not fully thought-out interventions. We do not yet have the necessary knowledge and a short-term national objective is not decisive in achieving the long-term objective of climate and energy. At the same time, this can lead to significant negative consequences for important parts of the Danish business community. It was also stressed by the Climate Council recently that it is not essential for the long-term conversion that the Danish greenhouse gases have been reduced by e.g. 37 per cent. 40% or 40%. in 2020. Overall, short-term national climate targets can thus become an expensive and not very effective decision that is not consistent with the Government's intention to pursue a green but realistic climate policy, focusing on bringing costs down and not up. The situation is different, of course, if it is an international obligation. This is a joint effort in which all countries take their share of the burden. This will also have a real effect on greenhouse gas emissions. So the effect on Danish competitiveness will be less and the climate effect greater. The new baseline projection for the development of energy consumption, energy production and greenhouse gas emissions in Denmark has just been published. I am very pleased that it confirms that Denmark continues to pursue an ambitious climate policy and expects to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. The published base projection shows that greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 are expected to be reduced by 40%. The changes in emission levels compared to last year's baseline projection are due to a number of changed assumptions, new knowledge rather than changing climate and energy policy. In the base projection, the effects of already adopted but not necessarily implemented actions are included, thus also the effects of the Finance Act for 2016. The new projection of greenhouse gas emissions does not mean that the government is changing its attitude in relation to the issue of setting a short-term national objective. We still do not want the focus to be on expensive here and now measures whose real impact on the long-term green transition is limited. What is important, on the other hand, is that we carry out a long-term change carried by common sense, so that we are able to pay the bill for it. For next year and next year there will also be slight variations in the assessment of emissions by 2020. This is due to a number of difficult predictable factors that are not immediately manageable through energy and climate policy. Depending on the developments in 2016, next year's base projection can therefore show a different level of reduction by 2020, although the policy course is the same. This underlines the challenges of setting meaningful short-term national climate targets and once again points out that the main tool of climate and energy policy is the broad international agreements. In achieving international objectives, broad national agreements such as the Energy Agreement are important tools. In my opinion, these are agreements that ensure stability and momentum. Thus, the government does not want a short-term national climate target that points beyond EU objectives, but this does not mean that the government does not have visions for Danish climate policy. The visions just need to make sense in relation to the development in Denmark and in the world around us. The Government's vision in the climate field is to maintain Denmark's position as one of the most ambitious countries in the world in the climate field, and to continue the well-known line in the EU. Here we are working to ensure a high level of ambition in the climate area of the European Union and, at the same time, we assume our share of responsibility for achieving the common ambitious climate targets set by the European Union. This has been the line towards achieving the EU's 2020 targets. Denmark provides, among other things: through its ambitious renewable energy expansion, a very significant contribution to climate action within the EU's common quota trading system covering emissions from the energy sector and industry in particular. Denmark, together with Sweden, is one of the countries in the EU that has expanded the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption most since 2005. At the same time, Denmark has one of the highest reduction targets in the EU in the so-called non-quota sectors, which in popular terms include the three Bs: farmers, cars and buildings. We are also well on the way to achieving that goal. This approach will ensure an ambitious climate policy while allowing competitive parts of Danish business to compete on an equal footing with the rest of the EU. Denmark will take on a significant commitment to achieving the EU 2030 target of at least 40% reduction. And it is not a small task that awaits us. The expectation is that Denmark will also have a reduction target for non-quota sectors at the high end this time. So we need to find out how to deal with a reduction target that could potentially be a significant challenge for our agriculture and transport sector, in particular, two areas that the government places high emphasis on. It is the Government's ambition that we should meet the EU's reduction targets by 2030 without unnecessarily burdening industry or the Danish Treasury. The two main challenges up to 2030 are, on the one hand, to ensure that Denmark's contribution to the EU's common climate targets, which is a reduction in greenhouse gases of at least 40%, and, on the other hand, to ensure continued sensible development in the energy sector when the current energy agreement expires in 2020. Before the end of 2018, discussions will begin within the Energy Regulatory Committee on a new energy agreement for the period after 2020. Overall, the task at this stage is to ensure that we do our preparatory work properly so that we are able to organise an appropriate climate and energy effort after 2020, pointing towards achieving the 2030 and 2050 targets. A first step is the establishment of the Government's Energy Commission. The Commission must, on the one hand, make recommendations for the organisation of the overall energy policy after 2020 and, on the other hand, identify cost-effective solutions for managing international climate commitments after 2020. The expectation is that the Commission's recommendations will be ready at the beginning of 2017. We must therefore arm ourselves with patience and devote the time necessary to finding the good solutions that will ensure a cost-effective transition of Danish society to low-mission. We need to find the right solutions that have the support of both the population and industry. It is crucial that the Danes are able to pay the bill for the conversion in the long run. That is why it is a question of finding the right balance, where we in Denmark continue both the green transition and at the same time take account of business, growth and employment. Having said all that, I would like to emphasise that although there may be nuance differences in the speed and extent of the green transition, it is my view that the overall objective of achieving a green transformation of Danish society enjoys broad support in the Folketing. This basic consensus on the overall objective provides the basis for a sound and objective exchange of views, which I very much appreciate and therefore look forward to unfolding and participating in today."", ""Thank you very much. During the past year, Danish energy policy has again been in decline, and everything from security of supply to the cost of PSOs has marked the debate. If I am to highlight an overall theme of energy policy in the past year, it must be that the framework for implementing energy policy in Denmark is changing, first and foremost at European level, where, in October 2014, we were given clarity as to the objectives to be applied up to 2030 in the EU area. Overall, the EU must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40%. in 2030 compared to 1990, and a binding target for renewable energy was set at 27 per cent. An energy efficiency target of 27 per cent was also adopted. Unfortunately, the latter objective is not binding. The government would have liked to see this, as energy efficiency improvement is at least as important a field of action as increased implementation of renewable energy. A strong and ambitious European climate and energy policy is central to ensuring as cost-effective a change in the Danish energy system as possible. The government will therefore work to ensure that the EU sets a visionary framework for energy and climate policy. Most recently, with the Energy Union, the EU has also reinforced its focus on integrating the Member States' energy systems to the benefit of, among others, European security of supply. The increased Europeanisation of energy policy creates opportunities as well as challenges. The closer integration of energy systems helps to ensure a cost-effective transition where the possibility of exporting and importing electricity is improved. This increases the value of the Danish-produced wind current, and the possibility of importing electricity from our neighbours contributes to the Danish security of supply. It is a system that we have had for many years in the Nordic countries and that has served us well. Now it is also important that the same thinking is spread to the rest of Europe and that we jointly reap the benefits. There have also been challenges. There is a new framework for State aid in the field of energy and the environment, and the European Commission focuses on whether the Danish PSP system is in breach of current EU legislation. The changed framework will have an impact on the way in which we organize future support for, among other things. renewable energy on. Moreover, I am full of confidence that we will solve the challenges and that we will have the many benefits of greater integration and Europeanisation of the energy policy of the countries. The phasing-in of more renewable energy and the ever closer integration of the various sectors of the energy sector and the electrification of the energy system are the basic ingredients of the transition towards 2050. The electricity sector will be the focal point of the transition, and appropriate and up-to-date regulation of the sector is essential to ensure that the transition takes place as planned and as appropriate. It is precisely for this reason that, following the Energy Agreement in 2012, the government launched a comprehensive work aimed at clarifying what the future regulation of the electricity system might look like, and the work was anchored in the El Regulatory Committee. The starting point of the committee's work is that regulation should support the interaction between the different parts of the energy system, thus ensuring a good framework for continuing phasing-in of renewable energy and contributing to a cost-effective transition characterised by a high degree of security of supply. In December 2014, the Electricity Regulatory Committee published their report, which proposes a number of proposals on how the regulation of the future electricity system should be. The recommendations will be the starting point for a political process in the near future, in which we will follow up on the great and thorough work that has formed the basis for the report. There are still voices in the debate, which are very concerned about industrial energy prices and competitiveness. However, there is good news for them too. Looking at the trend in electricity prices to industry, it can be seen that the Danish electricity prices to industry in recent statistics are lower than the EU average. This is due, in particular, to the fact that the charges for industrial process energy consumption with effect from 1 January 2014 have been reduced to the EU's minimum. As regards gas prices, concerns have been expressed as to the impact of the Danish target of phasing out natural gas pine in 2035 on the costs of the parts of the industry using gas. The government is aware that the green transition may have an impact on certain industrial energy costs, and the government naturally takes note of the concerns of industry. It is basically a priority for the conversion to be carried out cost-effectively and taking account of the competitiveness of the industry. This was also reflected in the growth agreement of the summer of 2014, when we just launched a series of initiatives aimed at improving the energy competitiveness of companies. We rolled back the security of supply tax and the gas PSO; we eased the cost of PSO for companies; we adopted initiatives to streamline the supply sector. Realising the efficiency of the supply sectors requires new regulation. In addition to promoting competitive energy prices, a new regulation will simultaneously aim to stimulate demand for efficient components and system solutions for the benefit of the development of Danish energy technology. Should it prove necessary to present further steps in the future to ensure a competitive and strong Danish industry, this is, of course, something the government will take the initiative on. Moreover, companies also have the possibility of obtaining subsidies through the RE to the process pool from the Energy Agreement if they want to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. This year's energy policy statement takes stock of a number of core energy policy areas and let me just highlight a few. Our power security is absolutely top-class. This is something we need to safeguard, which is why in January 2015, the Danish Energy Agency started work with a number of key actors in the energy sector, so that we can get a sense of how security of supply will develop in the short and medium term. In February 2015, it became clear that it is Vattenfall who is to build the new offshore wind farm Horns Rev 3, and it can supply power at a price of 77 cents per year. kilowatt-hour. It is significantly cheaper than the last time we built offshore wind turbines in Denmark, and it is right now the lowest price for sea wind in Europe. This simply confirms to me that Denmark is a pioneering country when it comes to pressing the technological development of the wind turbine industry so that it can compete in the near future on commercial terms. And the transformation of our energy system not only benefits security of supply and the environment and climate; it also contributes to creating a home market for innovative solutions to energy and climate problems. The Danish companies that are ready to deliver the products that can solve the challenges of the transition are strong as the transition in the countries around us takes off and it is to the benefit of Danish growth and employment. During the past year, a number of reports have just underlined that the energy sector in Denmark represents a significant contribution to the Danish economy, whether it is the export of energy raw materials or Danish energy technology and service. Most recently, a report published by the Danish Energy Agency, DI Energi og Dansk Energi has underlined that the export of energy technology is one of the things we are very skilled at here in Denmark. In 2014, Denmark exported energy technology for 74.4 billion. kr. That is an increase of 10.7%. in comparison to 2013. The 74.4 billion. kr. is equivalent to 12 per cent of exports of energy technology. of the total exports of goods. These are fine figures, and it is very much green energy technology that drives export growth. In 2014, Denmark exported green energy technology for 43.6 billion. kr. equivalent to 581⁄2%. of total energy technology exports. That is an increase of 15.6 per cent. In relation to 2013 it is, if I may say so, Chinese growth rates. The energy policy statement indicates that we must expect future production of oil and gas not to be able to make the same significant contribution to the Danish economy as has been the case in recent years. It is obvious that exports of energy technology can help to compensate for the lower economic activity in the oil and gas sector. As more and more countries within and outside the EU transform their energy systems, there will be very good opportunities to sell Danish energy technology products and solutions. So the government is working hard to redeem this potential. As the report shows, this is precisely why we are working with a number of countries where we focus in particular on emerging economies and where we are trying to ensure that their future economic growth is driven by green energy. We do this by sharing Danish experiences and Danish knowledge about how renewable energy is phased into the energy system. It is for the benefit of the environment and climate, but also for the Danish companies that are ready to deliver state-of-the-art climate solutions and energy technology solutions. Although Denmark is infinitely small in total global greenhouse gas emissions, it is through a strong commitment in countries such as South Africa and China that we can make a significant contribution to ensuring that global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced. The cooperating countries therefore benefit from Danish experience and Danish expertise to the benefit of their security of supply and the global fight against climate change.• At the same time, Danish companies have the opportunity to deliver Danish technology and know-how. Denmark is only interesting, however, as long as we go ahead and show our partners that conversion is possible and to pay. Therefore, we must not become less ambitious when, in the years to come, we have to organise the future energy policy in the years after 2020. Despite recent teasing about the government's 2050 objectives of fossil freedom, it is still my impression that the work for an ambitious transformation of the Danish energy system enjoys broad support across the majority of the Danish Parliament's parties, although there are nuance differences in terms of speed and extent of change. This creates the basis for a sound and objective exchange of views, which I very much appreciate. In conclusion, as so often before, I would like to stress that the support and great consensus of the parties of the Folketing is crucial if we are to ensure a cost-effective transition that is supported by both the population and industry. The decisions we are taking today will have far-reaching consequences for the way our energy system looks in 2050. The government will unceasingly work to ensure that Denmark also has an ambitious energy policy with broad political support in the future. And I look forward to continuing constructive dialogue on how best to achieve the energy policy objectives for Denmark. Thank you very much for the floor."", 'Thank you to the Minister for the statement, which gives some sort of status, but at the same time also leaves some clues in the future, and they are of course the ones that are interesting to discuss. I find it, for example. Interestingly, it is chosen to highlight EUDP\'s positive contribution to creating revenue, exports and employment in Danish companies, while at the same time the government has drastically reduced EUDP. It might be interesting to hear a little more about how this is related. What rate of increase does the Minister expect in Danish energy research towards 2020? COWI, DAMVAD Analytics and Ea Energy Analyses have evaluated the Danish energy research effort and concludes that there is a clear link with competitiveness, job creation and growth. For each crown invested in energy research support, there is an average of 21⁄2 DKK. in return. It would be good to hear the Minister\'s position on this. The report states that in recent years, the PRS tax has been increasing due to falling energy prices and increasing renewable energy expansion, and that is quite right and expected. In order to reduce the PRS tax, it is therefore appropriate to hear what initiatives the Minister envisages in terms of increasing the demand for electricity and thereby reducing the level of expenditure. Here the Climate Council recommends focusing on e.g. electric heat pumps and electric cars. After all, I can see that there is no majority in favour of continuing the PSO system as we know it today. That is a pity, because it is a good arrangement with good principles. We could have solved the problems of EU criticism by opening up some of our PRS support to green power producers abroad. After all, Germany has received the same message, and here the figures indicate that Denmark would receive more PESO money from Germany than we have to deliver the other way. Unfortunately, however, there is no majority in favour of such a solution. Since everything is still up in the air and the government, with the Conservatives\' announcement today, does not have a majority in favour of the financial law solution, I would urge that we jointly set up a future-proof system that creates the necessary stable framework for energy policy. Tax equality between energy sources would be appropriate and timely. It would benefit electricity and biogas. I would suggest to the Danish Parliament that we ensure more equal conditions of competition in the market for more forms of energy. This will result in a marked change in the market in which all forms of energy are treated more closely. Today, unfortunately, subsidies for fossil fuels distort the free market and cost dearly on the social, economic and environmental bottom lines. Denmark supports black energy much more than for example. The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Finland do. What I think we could all agree on is the problem of today not pricing the socio-economic extra cost of fossil fuels. When we do not do so, we are distorting the market and finding it difficult to really speed up the green transition. In the alternative, we hope that the real cost of using different forms of energy will be included in the price as soon as possible. That is how we can remedy the market failure we see today, when we do not take into account the social costs of fossil fuels. Today, for example, costs. Air pollution according to environmental economic wise men 39 billion. kr. annual. But this cost is not included in the price we pay for fossil energy, and we are therefore distorting the market. That is why, in the course of the debate, I hope to learn more about what is meant by the fact that the costs to industry and consumers must not be unnecessarily high. Here I am afraid that the government\'s definition of costs is very narrow, precisely because one does not look at the costs of continuing the use of fossil energy that is for climate, environment, nature and human health and well-being. At the same time, however, I am very pleased that changing governments have repeatedly pointed out the reason for including environmental damage in prices, most recently by this government in Part Analysis 1. This is an obvious sensible principle, but what is the government\'s position in relation to the IMF\'s report called ""How Large Are Global Energy Subsidies""? ▪ from 2015, pointing out that our inability to enforce this very principle annually costs 40 billion. kr., of which the State\'s waiver of tax revenue is a significant part of the explanation. In particular, reference is made to the low taxes on diesel, which have been included in this report. can see the effect of in South Jutland, how many German drivers choose to refuel because of low Danish taxes. Does the Minister intend to work towards a greater degree of enforcement of the government\'s own principle of including environmental damage in fiscal policy? The report also states that low supply prices are beneficial for both households and the competitiveness of energy and water-using companies and thus for Danish jobs. That\'s right. Previous investment in the VE extension has pushed down the electricity price, and that is good. In order to ensure a cost-effective transition, the Climate Council has therefore also called for a continued gradual and balanced expansion of renewable energy. The Danish Energy Agency has calculated that wind power capacity should be increased by approx. 350 MW per year if the 2050 target for a renewable energy-based supply sector is to be achieved. In comparison, the average wind power capacity has increased by only approx. 250 MW annually over the last 10 years. It has created a massive investment deficit. What initiatives will the Minister take to address this delay and ensure lower prices? The statement also states: ""El from biomass receives a fixed price surcharge of 15 øre per kWh and biomass is also exempt from energy and CO2 taxes. Then my question is whether the Minister believes that this cross-subsidisation is socio-economically appropriate, and I quote again from the statement: ""The use of biogas as transport fuel is only in its infancy. Yeah, that\'s right, and since 95 percent. of the transport sector is dependent on fossil fuels and at the same time the Danish Energy Agency considers gas to be the most optimal fuel for heavy transport, it is of course interesting to hear what the Minister is planning to do to facilitate that conversion. It is also highlighted in Part Analysis 1 of the tax and subsidy analysis: • An appropriate way to measure the green conversion can be the displacement of fossil energy consumption. That is to say, the amount of coal, natural gas and oil that is being phased out. This is a good way of measuring conversion, but how is the transition to light transport and gas for heavy transport, which will only become even more relevant when the European Commission brings their burden-sharing this summer? When the Minister says that it is important to maintain the Danish leadership in the export of green energy technology, I very much agree. But then it is as if the government is constantly backing up from the changeover, on the grounds that the changeover does not serve as an example to the outside world if it becomes too expensive for consumers and business. That is actually sensible enough, but I just think it will be more expensive, the longer we wait. The conversion is a bottom task that cannot go too slowly and will always pay off on all the bottom lines. In this context, I would also like to draw the Minister\'s attention to an OECD study in March which concludes that strict environmental requirements and legislation do not harm exports or competitiveness, on the contrary. Of course, parts of the heavily polluting industry will experience fewer benefits than the green industry, but this will be compensated for by socio-economic compensation for the increase in green exports. The time simply is not for inertia and for the effort to be made on past technologies. We know where we\'re going. Let us help the technology and business of the future rather than sticking to dogmatic and OECD-disproved assumptions that green regulation is damaging our economy when it is the opposite. In order to round off the international aspect briefly, I would like to commend the Minister for wanting to play an active role and press the European Union for a continued ambitious energy policy, but I just do not see that that is the case right now. A number of EU countries, such as Germany, Austria, France, Portugal, Belgium, England and Sweden, express the need for increased ambition on the part of the EU following the historic Paris agreement of December, and I am well aware that the government does not support that line. So I do not quite know how the minister thinks that the EU continues to push for an ambitious policy. Being ambitious in the European Union would mean actively working for the EU to set reduction targets for 2020, 2030 and 2050, which are in line with the conclusions of the Paris Agreement. But it works against Denmark, despite the fact that seven other countries are pushing for higher ambitions. Therefore, when we all welcome and recognise the Paris Agreement and believe that the transition should be cost-effective, I also find it strange that the government, for example, should be able to do so. do not work on an update of the EU 2030 target, as otherwise we will face a very drastic reduction curve after 2030, which will be expensive to implement. So sometimes I find it a little difficult to understand why you don\'t draw the conclusion from what you say. Cost-effective conversion means that we have to move quickly now, otherwise we will be very busy later. In conclusion, I would just like to call on the Minister and the government to listen to the many good recommendations and advice from the Climate Council, the government\'s own climate advisors, who come up with some very good advice in relation to, for example. reduction targets, PRS scheme, etc.']","<|system|>

This is not only reflected in the meetings I have at the level of the Foreign Affairs Council. I have recently visited the Baltic countries, particularly Estonia, to attend meetings between Benelux - which Belgium is currently chairing - and the Baltic countries. I can tell you that, in the region, the concern is probably even greater. While our countries are particularly concerned about the fight against terrorism, the situation in Syria, the situation in Iraq and other countries in the region, the Baltic countries are almost exclusively concerned about Russia's possible action in Ukraine. More than a crisis, it is a real conflict with disastrous humanitarian and security consequences. In fact, there are more than 1.5 million internally displaced persons. War crimes are regularly committed in eastern Ukraine and the European security architecture is dangerously damaged. Our collective security is based, among other things, on the inviolability of borders, military transparency and respect for international commitments. All of this is being breached. In recent weeks, the situation has deteriorated further. As you know, I issued a communiqué on 25 January to highlight how shocked I was at the deadly and destructive impact on the civilian population of the recent outbreak of armed violence in eastern Ukraine. Never before in this conflict, the commitments made by the parties concerned have been in such a mismatch with reality on the ground. It is difficult to understand that the parties agree on a ceasefire to flout it almost immediately thereafter. A month ago, concern was expressed about the possible emergence of a new frozen conflict in Donbass; but today it is the magnitude, violence and apparent absence of limits of hostilities that have cause for concern. The rebels have recently intensified their bombings and occupied significant new parts of Ukrainian territory. The clashes have continued in recent days, even during the peace talks. We have clear indications of the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine through videos, photos and other evidence gathered by the Ukrainian side and by numerous testimonies of separatists, Russian soldiers and their families. This presence is variable. Among other things, there are volunteers funded from abroad, special forces and regular Russian forces. Estimates of their numbers vary considerably from a few thousand to more than 10,000. There is no military solution to this conflict whose human cost is unbearable. Any solution must be acceptable to the parties concerned. Belgium therefore always supports the implementation of the Minsk Protocol, since it is the only agreed reference between Kiev and Moscow to date. We also, of course, support the peace efforts of President Hollande and Chancellor Merkel, who have the full confidence of all European partners. The aim is to reach an agreement, again, as in the protocol, but above all to implement this agreement. The fact of having a signed agreement is obviously not enough. I come to the various questions. Firstly, on the humanitarian situation: since the Balkan wars in the 1990s, Europe has no longer experienced a humanitarian crisis of this magnitude. The ongoing open military confrontation is very deadly, including and especially for the civilian population. It is a form of conventional war using heavy weapons in a rather urbanized environment. Artillery plays a leading role in military action on both sides, with a devastating impact on civilians, homes and infrastructure. It must be recognized that Ukraine is the victim of aggression and that human rights violations are far more numerous and serious in rebel areas. On both sides, however, indiscriminate bombings of residential areas were carried out in violation of international humanitarian law. I note with concern that the OSCE has found the use of fragmentation bombs against residential areas in at least one case. The European Union and its member countries have already provided humanitarian aid to Ukraine for more than €95 million to deal with this dramatic reality. On 30 January, Belgium released an amount of EUR 2 million for emergency humanitarian aid in Ukraine. With this assistance, the International Red Cross will be able to assist the affected populations by providing them with temporary shelter, food and water. As far as the Council of Europe and the human rights situation are concerned, in recent times I have dealt with this issue mainly in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. It was in Kiev and Moscow that I made my first trip in this capacity, in early December. In Kiev, I also reaffirmed Belgian support for the Ukrainian government. We have addressed the issue of future constitutional reforms and their entry into force. I stressed the need to reinvigorate fully the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia, while maintaining the sanctions framework. The goal is to achieve a de-escalation. We must control the reality of the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine and also control the borders so that there are no more Russian troops entering the region. I have dealt in detail with the issue of human rights throughout Ukraine. I stressed our expectations for reforms, particularly in the areas of judicial independence, the fight against corruption and the revision of the Constitution. I insisted on Ukraine's accession to the International Criminal Court. The Council of Europe, in particular with the Venice Commission, can provide assistance in all the discussions that will take place on constitutional reforms, on a redistribution of the country and on the distribution of autonomy or stronger decision-making capacities at the local level. In Moscow, I recalled the European position on the annexation of Crimea, illegal under international law, which cannot be recognised under any circumstances. On the occasion of our diplomatic days, I also had the opportunity to stress to the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Eliasson, the risk of almost de facto recognition that could arise through the presence of a number of international actors, particularly within the United Nations. We are therefore very vigilant to prevent the presence on the ground from gradually being regarded as a kind of de facto recognition of this annexation. The return to a political solution goes, I repeat, through the Minsk Protocol. I stressed that this protocol includes a ceasefire that must be respected on both sides, as well as control of the Ukrainian border. I expressed my commitment to the continuation of the dialogue with Russia within the framework of the Council of Europe. I raised the issue of human rights with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Justice and the Commissioner for Human Rights, interceding in particular in favour of the NGOs Memorial, Amnesty International and International Crisis Group, which are facing major difficulties with the Russian administration. In the meantime, I am pleased to learn that the Russian Supreme Court has refused to dissolve the NGO Memorial. I am pleased to have had these discussions because I believe that it is too rare for Western politicians to talk about human rights with Russia. I finally called for a new balance with Russia. On 26 January, I addressed these issues again during my participation in the winter session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. I stressed the implementation of the Minsk Protocol and the implementation of reforms in Ukraine. I noted that active Russian participation in all Council of Europe bodies, including the European Court of Human Rights, the Venice Commission and the Parliamentary Assembly, would benefit the Council of Europe, its members and Russia itself. However, I did not consider it appropriate to get involved in the relations between the Parliamentary Assembly and this delegation. I will meet tomorrow with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, Mr Jagland, and I will refer again to the Council of Europe's support for Ukraine, in particular the implementation of the 2015-2017 Action Plan. Ukraine must also develop a national human rights strategy. With regard to impunity in eastern Ukraine, Belgium's human rights policy is precisely one of its priorities in the fight against impunity. Our country supports monitoring activities in this regard, including the mission of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as well as the initiatives of the various Council of Europe bodies dealing with this issue. We will see if additional resources are to be made available in this area. With regard to the European Union's sanctions against Russia, economic measures aim to involve Russia sincerely and constructively in the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis. This is the position of the European Union and its G7 partners – the United States, Canada, Japan – as well as Australia. They have also adopted sanctions against Russia. Until now, we have not yet seen a clear change of course in the leadership of the Russian authorities, even though leading economic figures in Russia and elsewhere believe that the rebels would have gone much further in the absence of sanctions. No one has claimed that these would settle everything with a magic wand, but they have been in place for only six months. Their impact is felt heavily on the Russian economy. They are part of a longer-term perspective aimed at prompting the Russian government to reconsider its political approach to the Ukrainian question. It is clear that oil price developments also have a major impact on the economic and fiscal situation in Russia. Following the events in Marioupol, at the extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council on 29 January, I supported the adoption of new individual sanctions, which were formally approved during the Council meeting on 9 February. It was agreed that they would enter into force next Monday. No further decisions are necessary for such implementation to take place. For the rest, the relationship between the European Union and Russia obviously suffered from Moscow's negative role in the Ukrainian crisis. For example, the bilateral EU-Russia summits planned for 2014 have been cancelled. The European Investment Bank no longer finances new projects in Russia. Finally, the latter was excluded from the G8 and therefore returned to G7. Within the Member States of the Union, there are necessarily different approaches to Russia. Some are more conciliatory than others. On the other hand, there is a strong consensus on two points: the need to remain united on this issue and the assertion that, without any significant improvement in the Russian attitude towards Ukraine, it will be difficult to witness a warming of our relations. The detailed conclusions adopted by the various Councils attest to the high degree of consensus on Russia. I have repeatedly insisted that the European Union speak as much as possible with one voice and continue its dialogue with Russia beyond the Ukrainian issue, in formal and structured ways. In this regard, I welcome the continuation of dialogue with Russia on various international issues such as Syria and North Korea, as well as on other topics of common interest such as energy, climate change for COP21 in Paris this year, or the interpersonal contacts that are being promoted. I also welcome the fact that the last Foreign Affairs Council on 15 January mandated High Representative Federica Mogherini to improve the strategic communication of the European Union with a view to communicating upstream on the Union's policies, correcting misinformation as soon as it is disseminated, and supporting the development of independent media throughout the region. I turn to questions about our exports and the impact of sanctions on them. After the first nine months of 2013, exports to Russia of agricultural and food products, currently under embargo, amounted to 209.2 million, representing 5.3% of total Belgian exports to Russia. Following the Russian restrictive measures, after the first nine months of 2014, exports of the same products decreased by 34.9% to an amount of EUR 136.2 million. The share of these products in total Belgian exports to Russia fell to 4.3%. The Belgian agricultural and food products most affected by the embargo belong to the following three sectors: apples and pears, apricots, cherries and peaches, and tomatoes. For the first nine months of 2014, the export of apples and pears was still EUR 68.8 million, compared with EUR 16.4 million for apricots, cherries and peaches, and EUR 9.7 million for tomatoes. These three sectors together account for more than two thirds of the goods that can no longer be exported to Russia. Interestingly, despite the trade sanctions, Belgian exports of apples and pears to Russia after the first nine months of 2014 are 1.4% higher than in 2013. This indicates, therefore, that there had been significant growth in these exports in the first six months of 2014. On the other hand, for apricots, cherries, peaches and tomatoes, exports fell by 57.9% and 25.7%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2013. In the implementation of the Russian embargo, Belgium's global exports of products affected by the embargo increased by 3.1 million; for the first nine months of 2014, they were 2.4 per cent higher than in the same period of 2013. Generally speaking, if we look at their performance at the global level, the sectors most affected by the Russian embargo do not seem to have suffered too negative an impact. On the other hand, some subsectors are undoubtedly negatively affected. This is the case for the pigmeat sector, which was already subject to an export ban as early as March 2014 as a result of health measures taken by the Russian authorities. Partly because of the Russian embargo, the overall value of Belgian pigmeat exports fell by 6% compared to the same period in 2013. Exporters of apricots, cherries and fisheries also suffer from the embargo. World sales of these fruits fell by 34% in the first nine months of 2014 to a total of €50.4 million. Within this framework, European support measures have been taken within the framework provided for this purpose and according to the appropriations available. They are evaluated on an ongoing basis. The impact of Russian counter-sanctions is different depending on the sector of activity. A tailor-made approach is therefore required. For example, the pig industry was already subject, as I said, to an export ban following phytosanitary measures as early as March 2014, a few months before the general counter-sanctions were taken. It is also clear that if sanctions cannot be lifted, the solution for the affected sectors is to seek alternative markets. That is why, at the request of the affected sectors, I have taken the initiative to set up a task force that promotes the exchange of information between all relevant authorities and affected sectors and emphasizes the development of an appropriate framework to study the impact of sanctions and develop initiatives to address new markets in a coordinated manner. A similar exercise is being carried out at European level so that certain trade barriers can be removed in third countries. Examples include the authorization to export our pears to Canada, as well as intensive discussions with the United States to facilitate access to the U.S. market for certain agricultural products. There is no progress on a possible lifting of the food embargo. The food crisis can only be resolved through the global lifting of the embargo and the search for new markets. Despite repeated requests from many Member States, including Belgium, the European Commission has not foreseen the activation of new measures for the agricultural sector. At the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 26 January, Belgium called on the Commission to continue the various measures already activated under the CAP and to make full use of all the budgets foreseen in 2014. It also proposed new measures for the pig sector. As far as bilateral relations are concerned, our country has traditionally maintained good bilateral relations with Russia focused on important economic interests. Our firmness vis-à-vis Russia does not prevent us from maintaining these good relations. Economic contacts and various administrative and political contacts continue; however, we cannot speak of business as usual. Our bilateral relations are affected, whether we want them or not. We examine our political contacts on a case-by-case basis. We avoid any contact with the de facto authorities in Crimea, as I have also requested at United Nations level, and we also avoid, in principle, any contact with those who have been hit by international sanctions. I am very aware of the economic and commercial consequences of this situation for our companies. I also wanted to meet Belgian companies, both in Kiev and Moscow, last December. In the first ten months of 2014, our total exports to Russia decreased by about 20% due to the falling ruble and recession in Russia, where economic difficulties far exceed the direct impact of sanctions. Our investors in Russia are also affected. Within the framework of the OSCE, Belgium attaches great importance to the Organization's multifaceted role in dealing with the conflict in Ukraine. The OSCE has already contributed to curbing the escalation of the conflict and could play a more important role in the event of effective compliance with the ceasefire. As part of the OSCE special observer mission to Ukraine, Belgium is currently deploying two observers to Ukraine's eastern region; they are part of the observation team comprising many nations, including Russian and Ukrainian observers. Their mission is to verify the implementation of the provisions of the Minsk Agreement; in particular, they note the possible population movements, the humanitarian and health situation of local populations and displaced persons, as well as the violations caused by the fighting or by the movement of troops. The OSCE has not yet submitted an additional request to increase the number of observers. If that were the case - since the question was asked - Belgium stands ready to consider any new applications to that effect. Ukraine is in fact already receiving military assistance. Among other actors, NATO has set up trust funds to support the modernization of the Ukrainian army in various sectors, including cyber defence for example. Belgium believes that priority should be given to the search for a political solution. We do not believe in a military solution. To deliver lethal weapons to Ukraine would be to resign itself to military escalation and the triumph of a war logic. It would at least be premature. Belgium is therefore not in favour of this in the present circumstances. You will allow me not to mention the different hypotheses in case the situation deteriorates. This debate on the delivery of weapons is a sign of discouragement by the main players in the face of the failure of diplomatic efforts and of a growing sense of insecurity and uncertainty vis-à-vis Russia. This is a symptom of the very sharp deterioration of the situation, but as I said, we fully support the efforts currently under way at the initiative of the French President and the German Chancellor, with the full support of the European Union. You will have noticed that the American position has changed a little to leave space for this diplomatic initiative. As regards relations with NATO and the Eurasian Economic Union, I am in principle in favour of talks between the European Union and the EU and the revitalisation of the NATO-Russia Council. However, this seems to me to be conceivable only in an improved geopolitical climate. It requires, among other things, a de-escalation in eastern Ukraine and progress towards a political solution. With regard to Russia's cooperation with Turkey and the possible impact on Syria, I have no objection to Russia developing good cooperation with its neighbours, quite the contrary. This also applies to Turkey. Remember that Belgium also has good bilateral relations with Russia. Then why not good relations between Turkey and Russia? I do not think that the revival of cooperation between Russia and Turkey will immediately have a particular impact on the situation in the Middle East and, more specifically, on the peace talks with Syria. Russia and Turkey do play an important role in the dossier. That is why, in my bilateral contacts with these countries, I have also called, among other things, for improved access to humanitarian aid. In addition, a rapprochement between these two key players may have a longer-term impact on the political process that is still needed to resolve the conflict in Syria. I am also in favour of cooperation with Iran on such a dossier, as regards Syria, and in general with regard to the fight against Daesh. As far as nuclear energy is concerned, it is very useful to have Russia on board for the negotiations with Iran. On many different points, we need to continue in a proper dialogue with Russia on international issues. I have also received some questions about the specific situation in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. As far as Belgium is concerned, the priority for Georgia is the implementation of the Association Treaty with the European Union. I note, moreover, that relations between Georgia and Russia are improving, with the important exception of the problems of the two apostate regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. However, I am concerned about the alliance agreement between Abkhazia and Russia and the draft treaty between South Ossetia and Russia. The agreement with the region of Abkhazia concerns the Treaty on Alliance and Strategic Partnership, signed in Sochi on 24 November 2014 between the Russian Federation and the renegade region of Georgia. The text provides for collective defence, a coordinated foreign policy and the establishment of a common socio-economic area. The original draft treaty went much further but was amended at the request of the Abchazen. As early as 27 November, the European Union, in the framework of a meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council, pointed out the unacceptable nature of this Convention. Of course, the EU speaks as a single voice in the OSCE Permanent Council. Such an agreement is contrary to international law, as well as to Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in the light of its internationally recognised borders. Such an agreement also violates the international commitment made with Tbilisi by the agreement of 12 August 2008, as well as the implementing provisions of 8 September of the same year, to discuss the situation of the occupied territories in the framework of a bilateral dialogue. This step sends a strong negative signal to the ongoing efforts to stabilise the security situation in the region. Our country, of course, supports the position already developed within the European Union and will therefore contribute to this position in multilateral fora such as the UN, the OSCE and NATO. The draft treaty with South Ossetia represents an important transfer of powers from the de facto regime of South Ossetia to the Russian Federation, a transfer of forces, customs and police. This violates Georgia's territorial integrity and sovereignty. However, we will know this month what the final text of the Treaty will look like. Like my EU partners, I believe that the strategic agreements between the Russian Federation and the torn-off republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia are damaging the efforts made to ensure the stability of the region. In any case, this is a worrying development, but it cannot be compared with the annexation of part of Ukrainian territory by Russia. As President of the Council of Ministers of the Council of Europe, I will ensure that this organisation further supports Georgia's territorial integrity. According to our information, the Georgian Prime Minister, Irakli Garibashvili, on 9 January asked the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, to strongly condemn this agreement. However, the European Union has not yet formally expressed its opinion on this draft treaty, precisely because it is a draft. I would like to emphasise the special position of the Republica Moldova in its relationship with both the European Union and Russia. I had an exchange of views both during the discussions in Brussels, at the Foreign Affairs Council and with several fellow Members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and during the Benelux mission in Chisinau in September 2013 on the complex position of Moldova geopolitics. The subject of the Moldovan parliamentary elections of 30 November 2014 and Russian sanctions were placed on the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council in 2014. The general tone in the discussions on the election result was mixed and several of my fellow Members stressed in their statement both the actual election result, with overall a good result for the European coalition, and the lesser aspects of the election process, particularly with regard to the organisation of elections abroad and the shortcomings in the recognition of the political parties involved. I have always supported the pro-European course, pointing out, however, that a polarisation vis-à-vis Russia does not help Europe. There is no reason to believe that the EU-Moldova Association Agreement would be compromised. I hope that its implementation can take place as soon as possible, this year. I am therefore counting on you and all my fellow Members to complete the Belgian ratification procedure as soon as possible, both at federal and regional level. When Russia decided to place a number of Moldovan products on an embargo list, Europe decided to drastically increase the quotas for various fruits in the Free Trade Agreement, which is covered by the EU-Moldova Association Agreement. It goes without saying that once the association agreement comes into force, Moldova will be able to reach the European market under better conditions. For the sake of completeness, I should like to say that the Transnistria and Gagauzia regions are excluded from the Russian embargo. With regard to the problem of the Russian media in Moldova, I would point out that resources are limited. It is true that many Moldovans, including non-Russian speakers, look at Russian channels rather than their own Moldovan channels, partly from tradition and partly because of the choice of programmes. Account should also be taken of the Council of Europe's condemnation of past attempts by the government in Chisinau to limit the transmission range of Russian channels. It would undoubtedly be a good thing if the Moldovan channels were to communicate more and better in Russian, given the important minority of Russians, Ukrainians and Bulgarians who only have Russian as a communication language in common. Despite this delicate environment, I agree with the questioners that consideration should be given to how Europe is reacting and, above all, to how we can deliver a convincing message to a large part of the population that is still not won for European integration. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by saying that Belgium, the European Union and many other partners are first and foremost in favour of a political and diplomatic solution. There is now an opportunity to move in this direction with the new negotiations in Minsk. Tomorrow it will be possible for the European Council to draw some conclusions. It is not only useful to reach an agreement, it must really be implemented on the ground. It may not be the first agreement, but it is important that it is actually implemented on the ground. So we certainly do not argue in favour of supplying weapons. I have already said that we are very careful about this. It is too early to think of such a delivery. We must not continue the armed conflict on the ground. Secondly, in addition to a political solution for Ukraine, we also need a real dialogue with Russia. We need to be very concrete and precise and clear-cut. It is useful to establish a real dialogue, not only on Ukraine but also on Syria, Iran, climate change, energy and many other international challenges. Finally, we need a strategic discussion on a medium-term vision of relations between the European Union and Russia. I have already said that at previous meetings of our committee, but Russia is in our immediate neighbourhood. Beyond the monstrous conflicts and difficulties we face today, we need to think about how to build a relationship with Russia. We must also reflect on the situation of countries that are between Russia and us and that do not necessarily have to find themselves in a neutral situation but at least have the opportunity to develop their relations with the European Union as well as with a Russia that would change its way of thinking about the situation today. I hope that, in the next few hours or days, we will be able to give positive elements concerning the progress of a diplomatic solution and, I hope, a development on the ground. Otherwise, all actors will have to reposition themselves."", ""Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I appear before you to report on the Russian invasion of Ukraine and to express the position of the European Union and Spain on the violation of international legality perpetrated by President Putin. As you know, on 24 February, Europe suddenly remembered its worst nightmares. After weeks of enormous diplomatic efforts by the European Union to ensure peace in Ukraine, the leader of a nuclear power decided to invade a neighbouring, free, sovereign and democratic nation militarily. It did, as we are seeing in the media, cruelly and premeditatedly, without any event that triggered and therefore justifies this invasion. It did so by failing to fulfil its promises and commitments, thereby demonstrating the zero value it conferred on those promises and commitments. And he did it, as we all could hear, with arguments that I would call fallacious, that bring us echoes of that Europe victim of authoritarian leadership, imperialist fantasies and historical hallucinations that we definitely believed to be overtaken on our continent. There are irrational and unjustified decisions, ladies and gentlemen, which put the lives of innocent people at risk in the most cruel way we can imagine. Therefore, at the beginning of this appearance I would like to express to the head of the embassy of Ukraine, who accompanies us in plenary, the pain of the Spanish people for the loss of human lives in the invasion of Ukraine. [[Prolonged applause from the House, stood up, addressed to Mr Matiuschenko, Minister Counsellor and Chargé d'affaires of the Embassy of Ukraine in Spain, who is in the guest gallery.- Mr Matiuschenko thanks the support, stood up, with his hand in the heart]] Mr. Matiuschenko, please convey our support to the Ukrainian people, their Armed Forces and their rulers. We reiterate Spain's commitment, our commitment, solidarity and support for national sovereignty, the territorial integrity of its country, as well as our admiration and respect for the heroism and determination with which its people are fighting for their freedom and independence. This is how I personally transmitted it to President Zelenski last Sunday, in our last telephone conversation. A nation, Ukraine, with which, in addition, precisely this year, we are celebrating the 30th anniversary of our diplomatic relations. Ladies and gentlemen, I want to be very clear in my diagnosis of the origin of this conflict. President Putin does not accept consolidation as a global power of the European Union, whose democratic principles and values are opposed to the authoritarian regime he has imposed on Russia. Putin does not want democracy to move forward, Putin does not want Europe to continue to strengthen itself and that is why it attacks our security, in order to weaken and, consequently, to have an even weaker Europe. Throughout his presidency years, Putin has tried to divide Europe in all possible ways, with fake news, with misinformation, with cyberattacks, and espionage, approaching political actors and also economic actors in our country. On this occasion I thought I could do it again and it has found itself with quite the opposite, with a more united and determined Europe than ever before. We have reason, ladies and gentlemen, for this blunt unity. The invasion decreed by President Putin on Ukraine is a flagrant violation of international legality, it is a violation of the Charter of the United Nations, it is a burst of diplomatic channels as necessary in times of conflict, such as the format of Normandy, the OSCE or also the United Nations itself, and it is an attempt to redefine European borders by force, subjugating populations, imposing puppet governments, as we are also seeing in Belarus, and thus threatening European security. The events of the past few weeks show President Putin's willingness to implement a deliberate plan that aims to return us to a security scheme in accordance with his own particular interests. His expansionist vision has been taking shape over the last few years: in 2008 he intervened militarily in Georgia to support the separatist regions of South Ossetia and also of Abkhazia; in 2014 he occupied and annexed Crimea, and in 2022 he carried out a massive attack on Ukraine, a country in the heart of Europe, of the largest in our continent, bordering four European countries and 44 million inhabitants. Continue with that expansionist mood, and not just that. Putin has threatened countries of deep neutral and democratic tradition, such as Sweden and Finland; he has identified Baltic nations as countries that threaten Russian security; he has demanded a return to NATO's 1997 borders. In short, all an unacceptable provocation. Not only unacceptable, ladies and gentlemen, I would say that it is inexplicable because, in an era in which we must face as many global challenges as inequality, such as climate change, such as the technological revolution, the ageing of the population, the migratory movements or the very pandemic of the COVID-19 that is still facing the world - challenges, therefore, which require strengthened multilateralism - it seemed absolutely unthinkable to see tanks moving forward again in Europe. But, unfortunately, it is happening and we must therefore be united and decisive in the answer, as we are already doing, because what is at stake, as I said at the beginning of my speech, ladies and gentlemen, is the strength of the European Union, the strength of our values and our principles, our way of understanding and living in the world. Putin's actions represent an attack on the values on which our way of life and the international order, at least the European, has been based since the end of the Cold War. They are and constitute a direct threat to principles as deep-rooted as national sovereignty, such as the territorial integrity of nations, such as the freedom of peoples to decide their future, human rights, the peaceful resolution of conflicts through diplomacy, dialogue and the indivisibility of European security. Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, ladies and gentlemen, is a brutal attempt to curb the construction of a political space - the European - based on the defense of values radically opposed to the authoritarianism that he represents. The authoritarianism that represents, for example, the closure of independent media in Russia, as we have seen over these long years, chasing and imprisoning opponents, passing laws that deny, for example, the diversity of Russian society. They are all facts that form part of the same political attitude - they are not connected facts -: their disregard for human rights, democracy and the freedom of societies. And he does it, in addition, with the only language he understands: the language of war. Europe, ladies and gentlemen - I think we can all agree - is the embodiment, with all the defects that it may have, of multilateralism, democracy and the social and democratic rule of law. Countries like Ukraine, like Georgia, like Moldova, with which I also had the opportunity to speak over these weeks, or also all those who make up the so-called Western Balkans space are choosing, freely and democratically, to knock on the doors of the European Union, as we did in the 1980s. They see in Europe the model in which they want to live and also prosper, as Spain did from its first steps in democracy. The European Union, with the development of neighbourhood policies, with the partnership agreement so important that we have with Ukraine, with the Eastern Partnership or with the Southern Neighbourhood project that is driving Spain within the European Union, is trying to support the consolidation of democracy, freedom and the rule of law in these countries. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what Putin really fears. Putin fears the construction and strengthening of a geopolitical power in the European Union at the gates of its borders. Putin fears Europe because he fears democracy. That is why it attacks Europe, a power that represents a model radically opposed to the authoritarianism that it imposes on its population. That is why it wants to end the construction of a strong and powerful Europe in the context of global geopolitics. And this is, ladies and gentlemen, what's at stake. The bombs on Ukraine are the expression of an incarnated struggle between two antagonistic models of being and being in the world: on the one hand, the model of liberal democracies, of human rights, and on the other, authoritarianism that does not respect human rights or the freedom of its own people. It has been said, ladies and gentlemen, that there is rarely a war between two democratic nations and, if we think so, it has all its logic, because a democratic ruler responds to his people and rarely the peoples assume the cost of an unjust and unjust war. Countries that respect the principle of democratic law within themselves tend to accept international legality abroad. We are seeing Russia behaving like an aggressor power on the outside and violating international law by assaulting and invading a third country. But to keep that aggression out Putin behaves like an autocrat inward: arrests of those who protest against the invasion - as we have seen in recent days -, censorship of the independent media, persecution of the opposition and dissent. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to express my solidarity with the Russian people, who are going to suffer the cost of war for the imperialism of their president. I am convinced that the Russian people do not want war, that the Russian people know that while a few oligarchs, including Putin, amass multimillionaire fortunes, this unjust and unjustified war condemns them to poverty and ostracism in the world. We have seen in the streets of Russia how many citizens oppose this war, and we have also seen the repression by their own government to silence them through arrests. That is why I would like to ask President Putin to release immediately all those persons arbitrarily detained. [[Applauds]] Ladies and gentlemen, we must not deceive ourselves or be naive, for Putin everything is a tool for war, whether conventional war or also hybrid war, or also the disinformation campaigns that its terminals amplify. Take, for example, the news he expands to justify the invasion before his own. Putin has come to ensure that his actions are in self-defence, accuses the Ukrainian government of neo-Nazi and of committing genocide against the Russian population living in Ukraine, describes Russia's mission as to demilitarize and also de-nazify Ukraine. In short, lies and more lies and, by the way, a sound manipulation of reality, of history and of the dramatic meaning which the term genocide and Nazism had for humanity in our history. In spite of all your efforts, fortunately, ladies and gentlemen, this intense hybrid war of misinformation has not covered the truth, and this is that the Russian invasion of a sovereign country, in this case Ukraine, is an outrage to international legality, while it has found the overwhelming rejection of a vast majority of countries, for example, in the United Nations General Assembly, also in the Council of Europe from which Russia has been expelled, and logically in the unity around the Atlantic Alliance, the G7 and also in the European Union. In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to dwell for a moment in the European Union. Throughout its history, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has had to face great challenges. It is enough to remember the most immediate ones: in 2016, many people thought that the European project had been killed after the Brexit, with the departure, by the way, of a nuclear power from the European Union. But the Union has shown a strong unity in the defence of its interests and has even made progress in some aspects that seemed impossible in terms of their integration, such as the common security and defence policy. In 2020, ladies and gentlemen, many hoped that the COVID-19 would be a hard, very hard, probably difficult blow to overcome for the European Union, and that it would not be able to recover from this outbreak of the COVID pandemic. However, we were able to launch a health response to the pandemic; even more so, today, Europe is the world's largest vaccine donor, we donate more vaccines than we administer to our own population. And we were also able to boost European funds, recovery funds which, for the first time in the history of the European Union, have meant the issuance of European public debt, which is, in short, one of the main achievements for which, for example, Spain has been working over the last few decades. Funds that are a great opportunity to modernise our economy - to which I will then refer -, to strengthen something very important such as strategic autonomy, to strengthen our welfare model and to consolidate economic recovery and employment, as we have seen in today's data. Now, ladies and gentlemen, we are again facing a crisis that I would call brutal, which is also defining, and given this choice to do nothing and look elsewhere or to respond forcefully to Russia and strengthen our resilience as a Union, Europe has decided to strengthen its common project. On the external front, we do so by adopting unprecedented economic sanctions for their strength and also by launching humanitarian aid to help Ukrainian refugees and refugees, and by transferring defensive and offensive material to Ukraine. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain has always understood that this attack is against Europe, its principles and its values. That is why we have always advocated coordinated actions at European level, not a summary - as the High Representative recalled yesterday - of initiatives from each country. We therefore support the activation of the European Peace Fund for the delivery of defensive and offensive arms by the European Union to Ukraine. And I would also like to remind your ladies and gentlemen that Spain is the fourth donor to this fund. This has been my position, it has been the position of the Spanish Government, and I also believe that it is the right one, I firmly believe it. To a European threat we must give a European, coordinated and united response. That is what the high representative, Josep Borrell, asked us to do, and to that call Spain responded instantly. But as I see that there are groups that question the commitment of the Government of Spain in this respect, and for me and for the Government of Spain the unity of all is so important and so fundamental, I would also like to announce that Spain will hand over offensive military material to the Ukrainian resistance. [[Applauds]] Ladies and gentlemen, unity. Unity of Europe and its Member States. Unity of all parliamentary groups in response to Putin's brutal attack on Ukraine. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is a peace-loving country. The generations that preceded us fought for forty years against the dictatorship to achieve democracy, freedom and peace. Many of them paid a high price, paid the price of death, imprisonment or exile. That is why we Spaniards are moved when we see a people fighting for their freedom and we are outraged when a country lies to its citizens and oversteps international legality to invade another country. We have a very recent memory of 'No to war', but let us not be mistaken, ladies and gentlemen, today the no to the war of Iraq is the no to the war of Putin. [[Applauds]] What has Spain done throughout this crisis? To cement unity and not give Putin what he wants most, which is the division of Europe. Unity in economic aid to Ukraine. The European Union is providing financial assistance to sustain Ukraine's economy, first, by supporting institutional stability, with EUR 12 billion of macro-financial assistance; second, with immediate aid of EUR 45 million for humanitarian assistance and EUR 85 million for health equipment; and third, with EUR 355 million for the reconstruction of critical infrastructures, such as airports. Together with unity in economic aid to Ukraine, we are also deploying, as I said at the beginning, unity in economic sanctions. These sanctions will have a brutal and severe impact on Russia. The ultimate aim is to isolate the Putin government, Putin himself and also the oligarchy that supports him. The packages we have adopted include, among other things, the following measures. Firstly, individual sanctions on President Putin, on Foreign Minister Lavrov, on those responsible for the decisions taken these days, including logically those responsible and military personalities of Belarus. Along with these individual sanctions, financial sanctions have been carried out on State entities and enterprises, on the Government and the Central Bank: restrictions on the flow of Russian capital to the European Union; ban on financial assistance to a list of State enterprises, trade and investment; and ban on the sale of securities by Russian banks. Last Sunday, 27 February, as you know, new financial actions were launched, excluding some Russian banks from the SWIFT system and restricting the use of the international reserves of the Central Bank of Russia, as well as other measures directed against Russian oligarchs. We have also imposed sanctions on the export control of dual-use products, to logically limit that country's military capabilities, as well as additional sanctions in the field of energy for petroleum refining in the aerospace industry. We must add the ban, as you know, on Russian companies flying over the airspace of the whole of the European Union, as well as landing at or taking off our airports, and the ban on broadcasts of various media that we understand are propagandistics of the regime, which are used - not by journalists but by such platforms as Russia Today and Sputnik - for disinformation campaigns. We have also partially suspended the implementation of the agreement on facilitation of the issuance of visas in diplomatic or service passports. And finally, he announced that one of the measures that we are going to push from Spain, both in the European Union and in the OECD, is Russia's declaration as a tax haven, including that country on the blacklist of tax havens. [[Applauds]] Ladies and gentlemen, the Putin regime must be clear. These sanctions will be in effect until the invasion ends, leaves Ukraine - from all over Ukraine - and returns to the internationally recognized borders of the Russian Federation; sanctions all of them, ladies and gentlemen, whose impact in Russia we are already checking on the exchange rate of the ruble, on the fall of the stock exchange and the rise of the reference interest rates of the Russian Central Bank. Finally, as I have already told you at the beginning of my speech, last Sunday, 27 February, the Council of European Affairs approved the use for the first time in the history of the European Peace Support Fund for the delivery of arms to Ukraine. In this regard, EUR 500 million will be mobilised, of which EUR 450 million can be used, even for combat weapons and another EUR 50 million for defensive materials. Spain has been among the main drivers for this mechanism to be put in place, being able to provide even offensive material so that Ukrainians can defend themselves from this savage aggression, as further proof of the European Union's commitment to Ukraine. Ladies and gentlemen, unity in the European response. Unity that Spain will continue to cement in each and every of the actions that we take at Community level, and unity that we have also extended to the Atlantic Alliance. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that Putin has made three strategic mistakes with this invasion: the first, logically, is to believe that Ukraine was going to embrace the imperialist velocities of Russia, has clearly underestimated Ukraine's capacity for struggle and resistance; secondly, I believe that he has made the mistake of thinking that Europe was going to divide and has found us, as I said at the beginning of my speech, more united than ever; and thirdly, Putin has reminded us that NATO, as an alliance of States for its security, is more necessary than ever. Ladies and gentlemen, let us remember how statements have been made in recent years by all kinds of different leaders announcing, for example, the brain death of NATO, or the threat of the exit of NATO superpowers under Trump's administration in the United States. At the door of the Madrid Summit, where the new strategic concept of NATO will be defined for 2030 - in addition, in the year following 40 years of Spain's entry into NATO - Putin has succeeded in assembling the Atlantic Alliance and the unity between NATO and the European Union. The Atlantic Alliance has agreed, ladies and gentlemen, to strengthen the eastern flank to ensure the defence of all allies. As you know, Spain - yesterday we announced - will not send troops to Ukraine, nor is NATO predicting that. I repeat, neither Spain nor NATO will send troops to Ukraine, but we are contributing to strengthening NATO missions, as we announced with the deployment of our ships and combat aircraft in Bulgaria. Our commitment, which is effective and real, is demonstrated precisely by the deployments in Latvia, Bulgaria, Turkey and soon in Estonia. In fact, Spain has decided, together with NATO, to increase with 150 troops our contingent in the Allied mission in Latvia, which until now had 350 soldiers within the framework of the so-called Enhanced Presence. I believe that it is perfectly reflected in the agreements of the Council of Ministers on peace missions abroad which we adopted last December. In addition, beyond the immediate response to this crisis, we must continue to adapt and strengthen the Atlantic Alliance to meet the security challenges we face. Spain will support Ukraine in dealing with this attack. In addition to joint actions under the umbrella of the European Union and NATO, we have sent, as you know, 20 tons of humanitarian aid, two Spanish Air Force aircraft loaded with personal defensive equipment, as well as medical equipment. And in this regard, I have the firm intention of providing Ukraine with all the help and support that is possible, in accordance, logically, with our country's capabilities. I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that the Government has been mobilized from the outset to deal with all the international, European and national consequences that could arise from this conflict. A permanent and coordinated follow-up of the situation was carried out with all the ministries involved and, on the basis of our National Security System, the Situation Committee was also activated, which, as you know, is a body that is envisaged in the National Security Council as a support body, acting on the basis of strategic guidelines, if crises so require. And last 24 February, as you know, we met at the National Security Council presided over by the Head of State, King Philip VI. I informed the main opposition leader about the situation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has appeared before the General Courts, has been in contact with all the parliamentary groups and, likewise, I have had the opportunity to speak with the former Presidents of the Government who preceded me in the post to inform them of the situation and to obtain from them a vision derived from their international experience. In this respect, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the support and support expressed by the various political groups for this unprecedented and complex situation. I would also like to thank diplomatic personnel, and in particular our embassy in Kiev, and the State security forces and bodies for their work in these difficult days. I would especially like to recognize those who have contributed to the evacuation of the more than one hundred compatriots who decided to leave Ukraine. I would also like to say a few words to all the people who make up the Armed Forces and, in particular, those who participate in the various external missions, because thanks to their professionalism, thanks to their dedication, Spain is contributing to the collective effort for the maintenance of international peace and security. [[Applauds]] Ladies and gentlemen, the brutal invasion of Ukraine places us in the face of the need to defend our unnegotiable principles for a country like Spain; principles that affect fundamental aspects of the international order in which we believe and, therefore, the position of Spain is firm and decisive, clear and strong. However, I am going to be frank in this House, because we must also speak clearly to the Spanish and Spanish; the measures that we have adopted and those that we can adopt in the future within the European Union and also within the Atlantic Alliance will have a cost and will require sacrifices. As I warned last week, sanctions will have an impact on the European and Spanish economy, not only on macroeconomic figures, on state budgets or also on the business economy; they will have a logical impact on the family economy and also on commodities. All this inflationary tension, its derivatives, economic uncertainty, the sensitive increase in prices and the services most immediate to any need are going to have a cause, the unjustifiable war in Ukraine, and a guilty one, President Putin. And just as we are acting together in the response to Putin, just as we are united in supporting the economic and all kinds of sanctions that the European Union is putting forward to Russia, we must also act together in addressing the consequences of these same sanctions and, in general, the impact of this conflict on Spain and Europe. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I appeal to all parliamentary groups to achieve a pact of unity; unity in the response to the invasion and unity in the response to mitigate the impact of the war between us. I'll be more precise. Firstly, it is more than likely that financial and commercial sanctions will have an impact on Spanish exports to Russia, on investments by Spanish companies in that country and on Russian tourist flows in Spain. In addition, there is more than likely to be sudden interruptions in imports from Ukraine, one of the main suppliers of cereals, sunflower oil and other imports of agricultural products; but the most important and predictable impact will be on energy markets. Unlike other European countries, the Spanish dependence on Russian gas and oil is smaller. Spain only imports around 4.6% of Russia's oil and 8% of its gas; the direct impact will therefore be more limited. I can guarantee that security of supply is guaranteed, but in any case, the impact will be important on our country and on the European economy. The uncertainty associated with the conflict is already causing significant increases in wholesale prices of gas and crude oil markets, as we have seen in recent days. It is highly foreseeable that prices will remain high and volatile in the future with the direct impact on the consumer price index and, therefore, on the purchasing power and welfare of our compatriots. The result of all this will be a slowdown in economic growth in our country and in Europe, with fewer investments at a key time when Europe and Spain are consolidating economic recovery following the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Europe is, ladies and gentlemen, under an obligation to pay with this sacrifice what Ukrainians are paying with their freedom and with their lives. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the cost of non-response would be even greater than what we are going to suffer. Consequently, we must put a stop to Putin's imperial and authoritarian ambition among all of us. Therefore, aware that the response to the war is going to require sacrifices, we, ladies and gentlemen, have a huge responsibility to take action within our reach to prepare ourselves and make the impact as little as possible, especially on the most vulnerable families. To this end, the unity I propose is oriented towards working on two fronts. The first, the European, and the second, the national. At this point, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware that Europe is facing a conflict with Putin that will last a long time. Europe - I have no doubt - will certainly prevail, but we are facing a long crisis. Europe must therefore reduce its vulnerabilities and put an end to its weaknesses. Firstly, we must act on the European Union's own strategic vision, we must work on what is called our strategic autonomy, reduce our dependencies and strengthen our capacity to act in such dramatic situations as are currently being experienced in Ukraine. This attack is aimed at Ukraine, but that is not the immediate objective; Putin's real objective is to question Europe's security architecture. In order to meet this challenge, the only way forward is to make further progress in integration in areas such as the common foreign and defence policy; we must improve decision-making processes; we must make greater use of the qualified majority rule; we must therefore replace unanimity; and we must activate the common security and defence policy more effectively, of course, in full complementarity with NATO. As you know, we are working in the European Union and we are about to adopt the so-called Strategic compass, which is the European Union's defence strategy. Within the framework of NATO we are embarking on a process of reflection on the future that will culminate in the Madrid Summit next June with the adoption of the so-called Strategic Concept, that is, the strategic orientation of NATO by 2030. From Spain we want both documents - that of the European Union and that of NATO - to be fully aligned and that the two organisations complement each other in achieving their objectives. To this end, it will be very important to publish a new joint declaration on the European Union's relations with NATO, in which we are already working from both organisations. Secondly, we must react definitively to the energy security and dependence that some very important countries within the Union have on Russia. The Union depends, ladies and gentlemen, on almost 40% of a gas supplier which is generating the biggest security crisis in Europe since the Second World War. In these circumstances, we have to address the problem of security of supply, but I do not think we have to stay there. We must take advantage of these debates to resolve once and for all the problem of rising energy prices and the energy market as a whole. It was said that the problem of rising prices was temporary - we have heard this over the last few months - but now we see that the situation is not going to be resolved in the short term, rather on the contrary. This crisis has brought us greater uncertainty that has to serve as an acquittal to find structured solutions, permanent solutions. These solutions need to increase our capacity to adapt and transform the current energy system. Spain, ladies and gentlemen, has been leading concrete and ambitious proposals for this purpose for months, and we will continue to play a proactive role in putting our regasification capacity at the service of Europe, among other issues. At this point, I would like to recall that it is also urgent to make determined progress on electrical interconnections. As you know, the European Commission is preparing a second communication on energy, which we are going to expect to be issued as soon as possible, and which should take up some of the proposals on which the Spanish Government has been insisting for months, even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Some of these proposals are as follows. First, measures to reduce volatility and temporarily decouple gas and electricity prices, which would prevent the extraordinary rise in the wholesale gas price from marking the price of all electricity. Secondly, to encourage long-term contracts between agents to give stability to prices. Thirdly, measures that clearly address the speculation problems of the CO2 emissions market. With regard to gas, the European Commission has already announced the adoption of measures proposed by our country, such as joint purchases of gas and the creation of strategic reserves between several countries. In short, it is about ensuring that consumers perceive the benefits of decarbonising this energy transition, making this transition fair, that they do not pay unequally for the most vulnerable. I have talked about the decisions to be taken by Europe regarding strategic autonomy and energy security. I would now like to talk about the decisions that affect the humanitarian consequences of this war. Ladies and gentlemen, the invasion of Ukraine is already testing our refugee reception structures; it is assuming, as you know, a new wave of refugees, and this time our response has to be, logically, much more coordinated than we had in 2015. I would like to thank all the public institutions, the autonomous communities, also the municipal governments, for their demonstration to welcome possible refugees from Ukraine in our country, who are not coming massively to our country at the moment, but who, taking into account the Acnur figures, which already speak of 660,000 Ukrainians and Ukrainians who have left the country, this figure is clearly going to continue to grow and we are going to have to face this migration crisis. To that end, I believe that it is important and urgent to move forward in the negotiation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum, with a balance between solidarity and responsibility that responds to the needs of the States of first entry. I believe that solidarity is going to be fundamental to addressing the humanitarian consequences of this crisis. And in response to this humanitarian emergency, the European Commission has already proposed, as you know, to activate the temporary protection directive, which guarantees asylum for Ukrainian refugees without the need to apply the usual procedures. This week, the Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs are going to study this proposal, and if adopted, it would be the first time that the temporary protection directive has been activated since its entry into force in 2001. Finally, Europe must take decisions in the field of taxation. As you know, by the end of this year, the so-called Stability and Growth Pact escape clause is coming to an end, which has allowed Member States to commit the necessary spending programmes to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. I think we can all agree that, in the current context of war, it does not seem reasonable to return to the previous fiscal rules, which would force a tax adjustment disproportionate to the risk that this would entail for the recovery and also for the social cohesion of our continent. Now more than ever, in this new crisis, the Spanish Government is going to advocate, as it has been doing in recent years, for an adaptation of these fiscal rules so that we can continue to make progress in the recovery of the crisis provoked by COVID-19 and to address future investment needs in adaptation and mitigation to climate change, digital transformation and greater strategic autonomy for Europe, including strengthening common security. In short, ladies and gentlemen, at the European level, I ask you to promote Spain's unity in terms of energy and strategic autonomy, the revision of fiscal rules and the Pact on Migration and Asylum. And at the national policy level, it is our duty to push forward a national plan to respond to the impact of the war, and the Government is already in it. This plan has two characteristics, I think it should be open and dynamic. Open to the contributions that parliamentary groups, the rest of governments - autonomous and local - and social actors can make to the Executive. And it must also be dynamic, because in this first phase some of the consequences of the war are absolutely unpredictable. The national plan to respond to the impact of the war that I propose will have the following axes. First of all, we have to push for a big deal, a big income pact. We are all aware that one of the greatest economic risks of war is the price of energy, various raw materials and the translation to the cost of living. Throughout the pandemic, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we can all agree that social partners, trade unions and employers have given us an example of true patriotism, achieving among themselves and also with the Government up to fifteen important agreements that have ensured social peace during the pandemic and also, with agreed reforms, laying the foundations for our country's economic recovery and competitiveness. That is why I would like to invite the social partners to achieve an income pact, a great country agreement that provides stability and confidence, both from the perspective of wage costs and from the moderation of the margins and profits of companies, and all this with the aim of avoiding falling into an inflationary spiral that undermines the purchasing power of families, savers and puts economic recovery at risk. Secondly, the Government will protect the most vulnerable families, as we have done over these two years of legislature and two long years of pandemic. We will also deal with these consequences on the war front. For this reason, the Government is going to extend the discount of the electric social bonus by 60% for vulnerable groups and by 70% for severe vulnerable groups until 30 June. In addition, we invite the autonomous communities, local authorities, associations and social actors to redouble their efforts to assist the most vulnerable groups and to take additional social measures to improve and guarantee the conditions for confronting this energy shock in families. This is going to be one of the points I will take to the Conference of Presidents, which will take place in a few days. The third area, ladies and gentlemen, in which we propose to act is energy. We will devote important actions with the aim of accelerating our country's energy transition. When we talk about energy autonomy, ladies and gentlemen, we talk about strengthening and doubling and intensifying this energy transition that we have been making for three years now. As you know, the government's road map to a cleaner and decarbonised economy is clearly marked in the Transformation and Resilience Recovery Plan approved by the European Commission last June 2021, with €70 billion in European funds for the next three years. The plan is the responsibility of all public administrations, including the autonomous communities and local governments, whom it has called to cooperate closely in the implementation of the plan. Today more than ever, ladies and gentlemen, it is necessary for all administrations to be united and firm, in action and working together in order to be able to implement European funds as efficiently and as quickly as possible. These funds represent an investment in the modernisation of Spain that we cannot miss, and in this context I appeal to the parliamentary groups, to all the autonomous governments to take advantage of the opportunity represented by these European funds and to remove from the equation of political and partisan confrontation the management of European funds. In this direction, the energy measures already envisaged in the recovery plan are important, but in the current context the Government will take additional short-, medium- and long-term measures to protect families, businesses and our industry from the rise of the bill and thereby accelerate the energy transition. Immediately, ladies and gentlemen, the Spanish Government is going to extend until 30 June the tax measures currently in force at lower rates for energy: VAT on electricity to 10%, suspension of the tax on the value of electricity production, excise duty on electricity to a minimum of 0.5% and the temporary reduction of the extraordinary benefit of non-stationary gas generation plants will also be extended until 30 June, as a result of the impact of certain costs that they do not actually bear. And as other European countries do, we are going to protect our electrically-intensive industry, which is suffering tremendously from high electricity prices, and for this, during 2022, tolls will be reduced by 80% to more than 600 electrically-intensive consumers and the flexibility measures in natural gas supply contracts for industrial consumers will be extended until 30 June. Ladies and gentlemen, together with these short-term measures that I have just announced to you, it is necessary to undertake additional medium- and long-term actions to accelerate the green transition and thereby reduce our country's energy dependence and I would also say to the whole of the European Union. Firstly, it should be stressed that the cheapest energy is not wasted. Spain has a lot to do in the field of energy efficiency, since 30% of the energy consumption in Spain is produced by the building park, largely due to its high age. The recovery plan already provides important resources for the energy rehabilitation of residential buildings, including public buildings, but in the current context, the Government wishes to set an example through the General Administration of the State and urgently. We will activate the energy consumption reduction plan in the buildings and infrastructure of the General Administration of the State associated with air conditioning, mobility and public lighting. We will approve a budget of EUR 100 million for the replacement of public lighting, which will allow consumption reductions of 70% in this area. Together with the improvement of energy efficiency, we are going to implement the following structural measures aimed at accelerating the deployment of renewables and strengthening energy autonomy in our country: we are going to allocate an additional 500 million euros to accelerate self-consumption; we are going to remove barriers linked to electricity connection and also to speed up administrative processing; we are going to convene this first half of the year an additional auction of renewable energy to those already planned in the calendar, with the aim of accelerating its deployment in our country, and we are going to allocate a new 1000 million euros for the strategic project linked to renewable energy, hydrogen and storage, the project PERTE ERHA, with the aim of developing new renewable and storage projects that will allow us to increase the manufacture of photovoltaic, wind and ensure the supply of these basic elements for the energy transition. [[Applauds]] Fourthly, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the field of employment, in anticipation of temporary situations of depletion, cost increases or reductions in demand in specific sectors, the Government will speed up the approval and implementation of the RED Flexibility and Stabilization of Employment Mechanism. As you know, this instrument, included in the labour reform - recently approved and agreed with the social partners - will enable companies undergoing temporary or structural crises to adopt measures to reduce working hours, temporarily suspend employment contracts, always linked to retraining and vocational transition programmes. The fifth area of action concerns the tourism sector, ladies and gentlemen. The Government of Spain is working on the search for alternatives that can fill a possible absence of Russian tourists this coming high season in those destinations of our country preferred by them - as is the case, for example, of Catalonia - and if the conflict expands and affects the holiday period, we will be in a position to intensify the promotion of our most exposed destinations in other European markets likely to compensate for the absence of Russian tourists. In the area of the primary sector and in particular in the agricultural sector, which can be strongly affected by rising prices and disruptions in the supply of cereals and also in oilseeds - which are key to food and feed - I would like to announce that our country is going to ask the European Commission to use all the means at its disposal to facilitate the supply of cereals and oilseeds on European and international markets. Furthermore, if necessary and in the light of future developments in the conflict, we will call for the activation of the mechanisms of the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets to provide the necessary support to farmers and livestock farmers. [[Applauds]] Therefore, this national plan to respond to the impact of the war includes measures in the field of labour, energy, income pact, protection of vulnerable families, protection of sectors directly affected by sanctions and the demand to eliminate from the partisan confrontation a tool more necessary today than ever, such as European funds. Ladies and gentlemen, let me now turn to the area of our country's strategic autonomy, in which we need to take measures in coherence and alignment with the rest of our European partners. In the digital and technological sectors, we will also accelerate and strengthen investment in sectors such as microchips, semiconductors, storage and batteries, the deployment of 5G-related technologies, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data centres or the production of basic principles and essential medicines. Secondly, we are going to launch the creation of a reserve of goods considered strategic with the aim of preserving the rights and freedoms, the well-being of citizens, the provision of essential services and the resources of first necessity and strategic nature. This reservation is covered by the National Security Strategy, which is currently being discussed in Parliament. Thirdly, we need to strengthen cybersecurity in the face of possible cyber attacks, which are one of the main risks to the functioning of public administrations, businesses, critical infrastructure and financial markets. On the one hand, the Cybersecurity Operations Centre, which is promoting cybersecurity in the autonomous communities and municipalities, will be operational in the coming days, and, in addition, the National Cybersecurity Strategy will be approved by the Council of Ministers in the near future. And fourthly, in the coming years all the countries of the Union - also Spain - are called upon to increase our international commitments in the area of security and defence. The intention of the Government of Spain is that this greater effort should be clearly accompanied by the strengthening and development of our national industrial and technological capacities. In short, ladies and gentlemen, if we agree on the diagnosis, and it is that this is an attack on Europe, on its security, on its principles and that Europe is precisely a threat to Putin; if we agree that European unity is our main force to deal with this threat as real as it is disturbing that Putin represents; if we are united in the response to an unjust and unjustified invasion of the Putin regime in Ukraine, we must be united in the response that we have given from both Europe and Spain to the economic and social consequences of this war conflict. A war conflict, ladies and gentlemen, which is neither desired nor sought by Europe, but which will find the united response of all of Spain and all of Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by reflecting. I believe that throughout the history of Europe our continent has learned with all cruelty and also with all suffering that war is never the solution, that democracy is always the way to make progress in our societies. The road to Europe, ladies and gentlemen, has never been easy; sometimes - certainly too often - it is a story full of pain and suffering, but Europe has learned from that pain and suffering. That is why we are determined to defend the ideal of peace and freedom, democracy and social justice that we have had so much difficulty in achieving. Today, ladies and gentlemen, two paths open up to Spain and Europe: the path of peace and international legality or the path of illegitimate force that only leads to world disorder. For Spain as for the whole of Europe, the choice is tough, but it is simple. We are a country, we are a union committed to the values of peace, international legality and solidarity, on this occasion with the Ukrainian people. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. [[Applause of the ladies and gentlemen of the Socialist Parliamentary Group, on the floor. Applause of the ladies and gentlemen of the Confederal Parliamentary Group of the United Nations, on the floor...............................................................................................................................................................]]"", 'Dear compatriots! Dear Mr. Prime Minister! Dear Mr. Head! Honorable National Deputies of Ukraine! Remarkable representatives of the diplomatic corps! Your Grace! Reverend Fathers! Today, in this Hall of the Supreme Council, Ukraine will vote in favour of amending the Basic Law on the irreversibility of the course and acquisition of membership of Ukraine in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. [[Applause]] And I would like to take this opportunity to urge all of you, honourable national deputies, to support this initiative and to direct this document to the expertise of the Constitutional Court. This project is completely and completely in line with our Ukrainian national interests and is in harmony with the moods of most of our societies. On Friday, the most extensive international teachings of Rapid Trident were completed in the Yavorów region. Soldiers from 14 countries, 10 of which NATO member countries have worked together in the event of an attack by one of the neighbouring countries. We have once again demonstrated to all our partners that we are going to NATO, not with empty hands, but as a solid partner with a substantial contribution to overall continental and transatlantic security. September 1st was the year when the Association Agreement with the European Union became fully operational. Tomorrow, Ukraine issues a ten million - dollar biometric passport. And this, by the way, is an answer to those who, in trying to minimize the difficulty of the visa-free regime, claimed that the Ukrainians had little interest in it. Ten million Ukrainians have already received biometric passports for this short period of time. For Ukrainians, nearly two thirds of the world’s countries have been discovered. And we will continue to expand the area of freedom of movement for Ukrainian citizens. On this Monday, by my decree, I put into effect the decision of the Council of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine not to continue the treaty on, so-called, friendship with Russia. [[Applause]] And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will send a note to Moscow, and I will submit an appropriate bill to Parliament, because the last word in this matter is, my dears, behind you, to the Supreme Council of Ukraine. The Constitution proposes to delete the rule that allows for the establishment of the Black Sea fleet in Ukraine. [[Applause]] And after we return Crimea, the Russian base in Sevastopol will definitely be gone. [[Applause]] As I promised you, by the end of August, the SND had officially confirmed that Ukraine had closed its representation with statutory bodies, so-called cooperatives. One more thing is very important. Finally, the Ecumenical Patriarch’s exarches arrived in Kiev. [[Applause]] A decision was made on the granting of autocafalia to the Ukrainian local Orthodox Church. It\'s you and me doing this very important thing. And we will definitely win. The case was described by Metropolitan Ilario Ogienko as the work of completely dispersing our church. The Broadcasting and Broadcasting Board published a report on the compliance of radio stations with quotas for Ukrainian. And it\'s nice to say that the vast majority of radio companies are re-implementing the law. And I thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for supporting the Presidential Initiative to Change the Military Statutes, which introduce the long-awaited greeting: ""Glory to Ukraine"" -- ""The Hero of Fame."" [[Applause]] I very much hope that by the Day of Fatherland\'s Defender, which we celebrate on October 14, we, more specifically you, will approve this introduction, and I will sign it. Dear fellow countrymen, these events occurred only during the last month, and by hearing only, they seem to be completely diverse at first sight. And in fact, there\'s nothing random among them, all of them, part of our national pro-Ukraine and pro-European strategy, which we\'ve been consistently implementing with you over the last four years. And I emphasize, strongly stress, we will continue to do so. Each of these events is a testimony to our breakup with the colonial past, each of them a step towards our complete freedom from the empire. We finally got out of the mazes of vernacularity, barely jumped out of the deadly trap of non-locking, and since 2014, we have been firmly on our way, and this is the way to the European Union and NATO. And only the integration of Ukraine into Euro-Atlantic space guarantees peace for all of us, guarantees security for all of us and guarantees independence for Ukraine and a higher standard of living for the Ukrainian people. It was you and I who built a fighting army. We\'re returning to the Ukrainian Church a worthy place in the world Orthodoxy. It\'s very important that we finally protect, develop and support the Ukrainian language -- the component of the power and the success of our people. We will continue to take effective measures to strengthen the state status of the Ukrainian language, to strengthen and disseminate it in all spheres of public life. It\'s strange, I think in the very firm position in Ukrainian, individual national MPs left the room. [[Applause]] But no one will stop us. And thank you for your determination, and thank you for your unity. Because the army, the language, and the faith. And it\'s not a slogan, it\'s a formula for modern Ukrainian identity. The army will defend our land. The language defends our heart. The Church defends our soul. And perhaps in recent years the authorities have made many tactical mistakes. And for that, I personally have a part of the responsibility. But I know for a fact that we haven\'t missed anything and we haven\'t been wrong about strategy. To make a strong and successful Ukraine, an integral and unstoppable part of Europe, without any prospect of a return to the zone of Russian influence, is our goal, our ambition, our mission with you. Is our strategy irreversible, and how threatened is the rematch of the pro-Russian forces and the irresponsibility of the populists? And how can we make sure that the electoral cycle does not stop the country’s movement or, worse yet, turn us back? How can we avoid wasting what the Ukrainian people have accomplished at the cost of great trials? And in what way is strategic success converted into an increasing standard of living? What should be our urgent action in the coming years? The answer to these questions is my message, which is summarized in the current office of the President and forecasted for the years to come. The epithets that we characterize external and internal situations depend on where we are prescribed – in power or opposition, but in all current challenges and threats, our common dynamics are absolutely clear, the situation inside and around us is not exactly as dramatic as in 2014-2015. We\'ve become stronger and stronger, but first of all I\'d like to make a clear point about what most of society is objectively dissatisfied with. It was not possible to end the war and restore Ukraine’s territorial integrity. As a result of aggression, 20 percent of Ukraine’s industrial potential has been lost. This, of course, provoked the effect of dominoes on the entire Ukrainian economy. Along with Russia’s aggressive closure of its market for Ukrainian goods, this caused a deep social crisis. We stood still and resumed our growth. However, most Ukrainians have not yet experienced an improvement in their well - being, and the standard of living is being restored slowly and unevenly both in the regions and in the social and age groups, and pensioners in particular remain unprotected. We\'ve created anti-corruption infrastructure with you. Some new authorities have invested a large amount of financial resources in Ukraine’s taxpayers. But so far, the coefficient of their beneficial action is not exactly satisfied with me as President. And socially disappointed with the dynamics of anticorruption, and people\'s claims are completely justified. The country’s emigration took place on a serious scale. All the countries in Central-Eastern Europe that have become part of the European labour market in the process of European integration are facing this challenge in one way or another. Regrettably, the authorities have allowed many calculations in human resources policy, and bold experiments in this area have proved to be insufficient. The pace of reforms is not at all like the speed we were planning at the start. The problems proved to be deeper, stronger, more complex. Social and economic problems have political consequences. It\'s also a threat to the rematch of the pro-Russian forces, and the boom of left populism, and the manifestation of right radicalism, it\'s a lack of confidence in state institutions, doubts about the effectiveness of democratic governance, and sympathy for anarchy or vice versa. And against the backdrop of high expectations in society, there was a feeling of deep dissatisfaction, even from those who are confident that the country is moving in the right direction, many who think that we are moving zigzaglikely. And that certainly doesn\'t satisfy me. I\'m going to focus on these flaws on purpose, and I\'ve put them in particular in the structure of the performance ahead of the winnings. It is more than ever that we need to have a frank conversation. Just by not putting our heads in the sand simply by recognizing the real problems, we can offer society a real way of overcoming them. And at the same time, dear friends, that\'s not what I said, and all our international partners say that in the last four years, you and I have managed to make far more positive changes in Ukraine than in the previous 23 years of independence. We saved the country. The Kremlin of Barbarossa, the Putinian Blitzkrieg, the Russian Spring Plan -- all of this took place over a period of months. You and I formed an army that liberated two thirds of the territory of Donbas, which was occupied in the spring of 2014. [[Applause]] An army that has located the conflict and has a strong defense on the front line. It protects the country throughout the perimeter of the Ukrainian-Russian border. You and I have strengthened our international authority, organized a transatlantic coalition of Ukraine with a regime of firm sanctions against the aggressor country of the Russian Federation. We signed and won the Kremlin\'s diplomatic battle for ratifying the Association Agreement and for a deeper and inclusive free trade zone with the European Union and finally began to get the first big results from it. We jumped off a Russian ""gas needle"" where the presidents, the prime ministers, the governments sat for many years. It would seem that they were destined to sit on it forever and not: for two years now we have not bought gas in Russia, but a brilliant victory over a $ 4.6 billion Gazprom lawsuit in Stockholm arbitration has lifted us from the heavy burden of the 2009 cabal gas agreements. [[Applause]] As we know, thanks to these agreements, Ukraine has overpaid the Kremlin with tens of billions of dollars, and avoiding the default since the end of 2016 is also our achievement. Economic growth has been restored. And yesterday, in the second quarter, the gross domestic product of Ukraine increased by 3.8 percent. Yeah, it\'s not the number that completely suits us, but it\'s a solid indicator of the country\'s economic growth. It is of particular importance that we in the humanitarian sphere have decommunized, recognized at the national level, finally, after 25 years of independence of the army of the UNR and the Ukrainian rebel army as participants in national-liberal competitions. What, then, was not done before? [[Applause]] They formed a clear policy of national memory to strengthen Ukrainian identity. The position of the Ukrainian language on radio, television, cinematography, and book publishing was greatly enhanced. Yesterday I had the opportunity at the Lviv Book Forum to make sure of that. Because if there was a problem before how to force Ukrainians not to read Russian books, but to read Ukrainian, I can tell you today that this has happened. And if roads and schools are being repaired in your city or village, lighting the streets, taking out garbage, you are certainly talented with a city or a village head. Because it really takes a smart head to manage wisely the funds that are being transferred to places, and today this is more than 51 percent of the budget that is being budgeted as a result of our decentralization programme. The positive developments that I was just talking about needed responsible and time-consuming decisions by Parliament, the President, the Cabinet of Ministers. And thank you for working together with the national MPs, the ministers, the head of the Supreme Council, Andriy Paruba, Prime Minister Groissman, Yatsenuk, and all those who have done this. [[Applause]] And all of us together have to thank the great Ukrainian people for the remarkable changes that have become possible as a result of the war effort on the front and the hard work in the back of the nation\'s expansion. [[Applause]] Dear compatriots! Of course, in a short message, I can\'t cover everything, especially the fact that it\'s thematically focused on the issues of our European and Euro-Atlantic strategy. Your attention is traditionally given to an analytical report prepared by the National Institute of Strategic Research, but I will stop, first of all, on issues that fall within the direct functions of the President, and I would like to pay the highest attention to issues of foreign policy and defence, guarantees of sovereignty, rights and freedoms of citizens, and the general strategy of state building. I\'ll start with the Army. Only 6,000 fully equipped to fight in the spring of 2014 could stand up the Armed Forces of Ukraine when the aggression of the Russian Federation against our state began. And then, if the transport was with the wheels, it was with the fuel, with the batteries. And it\'s no reproach to the military, it\'s a sentence to politicians, prime ministers, defence ministers, who for years have cut down on their own, sold their weapons, scattered their property, butchered hospitals, military towns, polygons, looted the land; a little bit more, they would have let the soldiers out of the hammer. [[Applause]] That\'s what it\'s called making money in the army. And as a result, our soldiers came out to protect Motherland barefoot and bare against the largest army on the continent. And yet, by concentrating all the resources available at that time, thanks to the courage of the soldiers and the powerful volunteer movement, thanks to the volunteers, we stopped the aggressor. [[Applause]] In the summer of 14, there was a lot of time to spend and a lot of money on food, clothing, shoes, medicine cabinets, helmets. The armored vests for most parts were completely removed from their weapons and were not planning to be purchased, as was unloading, and other essential items. They collected everything in peace by thread. And today we\'re going to have to take a completely different height: these are new technologies, modernization, weapons, rearming, the exact transition to NATO standards, taking into account our unique experience of Russian aggression. And weapons upgrades take place on the basis of a importing strategy, where we got rid of total dependence on supply from the Russian Federation. And just imagine that in 13 years this dependence on different types of weapons was between 50 and 70 percent. And it\'s necessary to do it in the same way and in more order. And really, we\'ve gone to 3 percent of GDP for defense, and this is the first time there\'s an independent Ukraine, and a huge achievement. It\'s sensitive to the state budget, and it\'s sensitive to the economy, but it\'s quite modest compared to the military spending of the aggressor country. Our defense needs are clearly far beyond our capabilities, and we need to work with you to find nonstandard solutions. Society, the Armed Forces are waiting for breakthrough systemic solutions — defence decisions. And I demand military leadership from the non-standard asymmetric responses to any scenarios and opponent\'s plans. Our army is becoming an army of a new generation of Ukrainians, the army has mastered the modern forms of fighting in all areas of traditional and new, including informational and cyberspace. High-precision long-term firearms, high-tech intelligence, efficient management systems, space support, echelon anti-air defence, powerful special forces we created, renewed naval forces and other signs of the modern army are to become and gradually become reality in Ukraine. Yes, our intentions are ambitious, but real. We are already planning an active development and preparation of production and purchase of modern high-precision rocket weapons, accurate ammunition for new artillery systems, armoured equipment, high-precision other means of damage. And the order of the day of the coming is the rise of the defense of the Ukrainian part of the waterfront and the coast of the Azov Sea. From the Ministry of Defence, I demand that the General Staff expedite the achievement by the defence sector of the North Atlantic Alliance standards, just as well as full operational compatibility with the armies of the member states of this defence and political bloc. But in all the transformations, there must be people in the first place, special people who have chosen the profession -- the profession of protecting the country. [[Applause]] People, our soldiers, who risk themselves daily on the front lines of the defense of the state. And so in order of the day-to-day systemic transformation in human resources policy, opportunities for transparent and fair career growth, military education, security issues. And in line with my proposed decision, the National Security and Defence Council in the State Budget is expected to increase by at least 37 percent. And in October, we\'re finally going to start putting into operation new dormitories for contractors -- 184 new rooms that will accommodate about 23,000 contract soldiers. Part of this year, part of it is early next year. I want to remind you once again that the sources for financing all these objects are the funds that the efforts of the law enforcement agencies, the Attorney General\'s Office, have been confiscated from the previous authorities. In addition, another social project is planned – ""complex apartments for a sergeant\'s corps"", which is also the basis of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It\'s part of a building and building project. And it\'s appropriate to remind ourselves that these and other projects are being implemented through the active support of partner states, advisors, instructors from the armed forces of NATO member states. And you and I have to do everything we can to create comfortable conditions for experienced soldiers. To motivate professionals to contract long-term with the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Encourage those who for various reasons have been released to return to the army. In fact, we owe our soldiers an unpaid debt. In general, there is no amount that can be measured by what they do for our nation. The new army must have a modern ideology. And here the changes are obvious. The deradanization of the army is the new names of military forces, new greetings, new signs, new traditions, new holidays, like the Motherland Defender\'s Day. Remember, four years ago we were still celebrating, actually, they were celebrating February 23rd. Not all our defense plans have been implemented, and not all the issues have been resolved. We see clearly the weak spots. The issues of national security and the defense of the state remain for me as the President and for our entire team as an absolute daily priority. Dear Ukrainians! The most reliable allies of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the protection of the Fatherland are our diplomats, who operate under extremely difficult conditions. Their work requires much experience and skill. The world is debilitating, global and regional security systems are ineffective, under great threat. Ukraine is in the epicenter of processes that determine the future of the continent and the world. And I would like to thank the parliament, the government that introduced this project, for adopting the relevant Law on Diplomatic Service, a sharp increase in the financing of Ukrainian diplomacy. Because the task facing Ukrainian diplomats is unique. Russian aggression surprised the West suddenly. All the important signals were ignored: and the provocation on Tuzla; and the openly aggressive speech by the Russian President at the Munich Security Forum in 2007, where he, in principle, warned everyone about everything; and the attack in 2008 by Russia on Georgia; and the first reaction to the occupation of Crimea turned out to be extremely languid and toothless. And even now, after thousands of Russian-induced victims on Donbas, after the MH17 tragedy, after Syria, after Solsbury in the West, many willing to look Putina into the soul, do I still not know where I am and what do you want to see there, gentlemen? [[Applause]] Nevertheless, in everyone’s eyes: Russia supports right and left-wing movements, inspires Euroscepticism, intervenes in elections around the world, intervenes in referendums, as was the case in the Netherlands. In this way the Kremlin is advancing its alternative order of the day, its alternative values, hoping that the West will become increasingly difficult to maintain a single position on Moscow. One who thinks that Russian aggression automatically provides automatic support to the West is deeply wrong. That\'s not true. And for support, we have to fight every day. And over the past 4.5 years, we have managed not only to create and maintain a powerful transatlantic coalition to support Ukraine, but to significantly expand and strengthen it. The principle of ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine"" has become an axiom of international politics. The suggestions to break it and arrange it in our backs from time to time are actually coming out every month, and we\'re out of it. And no one is denying our European identity anymore. Over the next year, I plan to make practical progress on my initiatives to integrate Ukraine into the digital common energy union market, as well as to increase cooperation in the customs field. But to move on, first of all, we need to implement the Association Agreement from the first to the last letter. The speed of its implementation is not yet enough. And I urge Parliament and the government to move at a better pace. I\'m ready to be a partner in this process. Moreover, each day the covenant proves its effectiveness and validity. The share of the European Union in exports varies from 42 to 43 percent, and this is a major contributor to the losses caused by the war, the economic blockade, the closure of the markets by Russia. He\'s heavy, but he\'s not good enough. And that\'s why last month, at the annual meeting of the heads of foreign diplomatic institutions, a number of our embassies were criticized in Latin America, Africa, Asia. Are the markets of these countries not important for the sale of our goods and the creation of new jobs in Ukraine? We need to look for more and more trading partners, building points in regional markets that show high growth rates, where there\'s demand for our products. We learn foreign political pragmatism, and we find the best way for us to continue playing in even the most complex parties. In particular, this approach has enabled us to build an effective relationship with the new American administration. What is worthy of the decision of the President of the United States to provide Ukraine with air defence weapons? And that\'s just the beginning. Such cooperation will continue. [[Applause]] On Tuesday, the United States Senate approved a 19th-year budget for the Pentagon, which envisions $250 million for security assistance to Ukraine. And this is the best evidence that there is a very high level of trust between Kiev and Washington. Of course, we cannot help but worry about the differences between key players in world trade. They have a global dimension and they\'re going to affect our economy, obviously not with a positive sign. The external risks that make our situation more difficult also include a surge in left and legal populism, an increase in Eurosceptic moods, non-democratic trends in some neighbouring countries, a hybrid attack by Russia on the United States, the European Union, and Ukraine. Some of us are insulted by the fact that sanctions in connection with the annexation of Crimea and the Russian occupation of Donbas look softer than those introduced later in response to an intervention in elections or a chemical attack in Solsbury. The unpleasant sediment is, of course, there is. But on the other hand, it is extremely important that sanctions against Moscow are now not only related to Ukraine. Why? Because that means that Russia is not just our problem, it is a threat to the entire civilized world. And we will consistently resist attempts to reduce the sanctions pressure on Russia. The Kremlin\'s tactical task is to lift sanctions in January next year under the alleged failure of Ukraine to implement the Minsk Accords – I think we should destroy this scenario. Almost convinced that we will not allow the film to be taken. But know that the risk of mitigation is. The fact that Russia is so persistently fighting sanctions only shows that they are effective, they work because the ruble is falling even when oil prices are rising. Russian authorities are forced to increase their retirement age. The Russian authorities went to raise VAT. That is the price of aggression. Last year, an unpleasant surprise for the Kremlin was the extension by the Ukrainian Parliament of the Law on the Special Order of Local Self-Government in Certain Areas of Donetsk and Lugansk. By your responsible vote, it was you, the distinguished national MPs, who beat the goat out of Putin’s hands. [[Applause]] And I want to point out that the Russians then had to substantially adjust their tactics. Now they\'ve got that map again. The Kremlin and its dumplings try to convince the European community of the unwillingness of the Ukrainian side to continue the law. This, according to the Russian Federation, is an indication of Ukraine\'s inability to perform, to make a commitment, so they said sanctions should be lifted. Agree, it would be a criminal mistake to give Moscow a chance to accuse Ukraine of failing to make deals and to achieve a reduction in sanctions pressure. I\'m absolutely convinced that this is definitely not a Ukrainian script. At the same time, I stress that real progress in regulation should be demonstrated, the main indicator of which is the harmonization of deployment parameters on the Donbas peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the United Nations. And that\'s what I\'m going to talk about next week during a visit and a New York speech at the United Nations General Assembly. The mission must be deployed throughout Ukraine. It\'s bound to go to the Ukrainian-Russian border. And this will allow you to create conditions for the execution of part of the Minsk Accords, including the withdrawal of Russian troops from occupied Ukrainian territory. If this does not happen, the Law on the Special Order of Local Self - Rule will never work. That\'s got to be our logic. The whole responsibility for the collapse of the mine process is exactly what Russia needs to do. No matter how many spears are broken around Minsk, it is through these arrangements that we have managed to stop the active phase of aggression and achieve the sanctions regime and, above all, to win time and build an army, and to move from mobilization to contractual assembly of frontal units. And the Kremlin is trying to convince our allies that Ukraine is preparing a powerful rescue scenario for Donbas. Of course, we have to have a similar option, every army has to be ready for any scenario. There is a right to self-defence in Ukraine, according to article 51 of the United Nations Statute, and we have highlighted this separately in the recently approved law on the reintegration of Donbas. But our strategy for peace is to achieve a political and diplomatic path, because this option is optimal for Ukraine and is in our national interest. Russia’s attack began with an attempt to annex Crimea. His return is to end, including compensation for the damage that has been caused and the provision of effective guarantees for the nonrepetition of aggression. We fight for it in international courts, and we\'re sure we\'ll win in Stockholm. Gazprom is going to pay us a total of 4.6 billion dollars. We convince the world that any concessions to the Kremlin without restoring Ukraine\'s territorial integrity are defeat, defeat and freedom, the loss of democratic Europe and the victory of authoritarian Asia. And in the meantime, we have the whole country surrounded by running boards calling for compromise with the aggressor. Almost every pillar was filled with doves of peace, but it was a shadow of them. [[Applause]] Just a shadow from them, from these doves, like from a two-headed man. And do not be misled by the soothing vortex, for in the beaks of these turtledoves the seed of peace is on Russian terms. [[Applause]] Peace is a beautiful and attractive envelope that you can put anything into. So we need to keep on the watch. Let us not forget that the enemy did not come here for Crimea and the enemy did not come here for Donbas – the enemy came all over Ukraine, and without Ukraine the empire is not possible. So where are we going to keep the boundary of what\'s called compromise? By Donz, by Dniper, or by Confusion? The desire for real peace on the basis of Ukrainian interest, the fight for it, the issue of sovereignty, the territorial integrity of Ukraine and our civilisational choice are not, and I stress, will not be the object of compromise. Because otherwise we will not be, or we will be no longer us, or another nation’s soldiers will be standing here. So on the question, what is not the question of ""to be or not to be?"" (to be or not), we are, of course, ready for diplomatic flexibility, because, in fact, there is no easy and easy road to peace, especially in the face of an enemy whose military potential is much greater. And no one wants peace more than we Ukrainians do, for as no one else does, we know what war really is. And once again, the fuse of war, and the keys to peace, they don\'t go to Kiev, not Brussels or Washington -- they\'re in Moscow. But peace will not bring us the peace of an aggressor, nor will it agree on Russia’s terms. True and just peace will only lead us to strengthen the security of our country, strengthen our army, strengthen our diplomatic corps, and strengthen our unity within the country. [[Applause]] The pursuit of peace and victory has both a strong front and a reliable backdrop, unity and unity of society in the fight against the enemy. And to strengthen that unity is to create the only local Orthodox Ukrainian Church. [[Applause]] As I said before, the Ecumenical Patriarch\'s exarches, after rejecting all diplomatic terms, said to me, ""The process of autocathalization to Ukraine is moving towards the finish line."" They said it publicly. [[Applause]] I want to make a point, I don\'t know when I\'m going to get it. Tomos and when he\'s brought to Kiev. But I\'m sure that the wheel of this story we\'ve set up with you so that no one will be able to bring it back. [[Applause]] I would like to point out that another 100 years ago, the issue of autocephaly was put in order by the Ukrainian National Republic for the day. 27 years ago, Ukraine renewed the struggle for auto-cefalia, but I stress that the last four years have been decisive, first quiet, and now public diplomacy, including yours, the distinguished national deputies, aid. As the Scriptures indicate, we will not worship foreign gods with you, nor will the State intervene in the internal affairs of the church. Especially the foreign state. [[Applause]] Why are they fighting so hard for this? Because the empire is losing one of the last weights of influence. Tomos is actually another act of declaring Ukraine\'s independence. For us, our own church is a guarantee of spiritual freedom, a guarantee of social harmony. I guarantee that the state will respect the choice of those who decide to remain in that church structure that will preserve unity with the Russian Orthodox Church and call it the same, and it will be in order to make it easier to understand. [[Applause]] But at the same time, I guarantee that the state will protect and do not fear them, protect the rights of those priests and laymen of the OPC of the Moscow Patriarchate who will voluntarily decide to leave Moscow to create the only local Orthodox Church. [[Applause]] Another important thing is that the meaning of Tomos goes far beyond the borders of Ukraine. What is it? And this is the fall of Third Rome as Moscow\'s oldest conceptual claim to world hegemony. Here, in our territories, the future of the world\'s Orthodoxy is being resolved, and the Russians and I also understand it completely differently, and that\'s another reason why the Russians and I are not on the road. They have the so-called ""strengthening"" of the authoritarian regime, and we, as the largest Orthodox country in Europe, will demonstrate as organically, in one national body, use Christianity of the Eastern ritual and democracy. Saving democracy in an environment of external aggression was not easy, although the state of war would greatly strengthen the President\'s authority and capabilities. I firmly rejected the offer to introduce it. In times of war, we did not restrict the political rights and freedoms of citizens, nor did we censor. The President\'s constitutional capacity for the parliamentary-presidential model is not very much in line with this degree of responsibility that society traditionally relies on the elected head of state. But even in the most difficult years, when the country was literally smothered by too many internal and external problems, the President never once asked for an increase in his authority. Moreover, some of them refused, if you did not notice, the appointment of judges, including judges. And in the country, there\'s now a system of restraints and opposites. Ukrainians are not inclined to give a monopoly to govern one political power. Power is a coalition character. Our government is essentially coalition. The largest is the coalition. In fact, there is also the largest parliamentary faction. And at the same time, you and I are all very successful in finding common ground. We\'ve all endorsed a record number of reform decisions together. The President does not impose vetoes on laws very often, and he has never exercised his legitimate constitutional right to suspend the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine in all years, with simultaneous referral to the Constitutional Court. The European strategy dictates an algorithm for the development of the political system as a parliamentary-presidential representative democracy, with the country requiring the President and the Supreme Commander to organize an effective defence and defence of the country, which is the main work of the Head of State. Last year I rejected numerous proposals for constitutional changes in the political system. I believe that before the elections, such manoeuvres do not correspond to a European political culture that teaches us to play by the rules, not by the rules, but, of course, with the interest of following a social debate, and I find it absolutely unacceptable that proposals that are clearly non-democratic. Someone openly advocates educated authoritarianism, and someone is embezzling this authoritarianism into the parliamentary type of chancellorism. And only if you read into the content, not the title, is there a chancellor of authority more than a Kaiser. In fact, the Reichstag creates a one-party system. The regime of single power has brought nothing good to Ukraine, and this is a lesson to be remembered by everyone. [[Applause]] The ghost of authoritarianism is not the only challenge associated with the upcoming elections. There\'s also a threat to the rematch. And unfortunately, there are figures on the Ukrainian political chessboard that allow Moscow to walk on its own. Over the course of four years, we have restored not only the army but also the intelligence, so we have not an approximate but a fairly accurate view of the Kremlin’s plans. The fifth column is known to dream of forming a powerful pro-Russian opposition in the new parliament. And if you\'re lucky, you can also make her a member of a new coalition with the right of veto to European and Euro-Atlantic integration. We see the fifth column raising its head, trying to gather the different sherengs, using the benefits of democracy, getting very active in the information space, and our task is extremely difficult to give them back without violating the norms of European democracy. And I can see that by the power of law, by the power of conviction, there is no chance for those who might question our own path -- the path of independence, the path of European and Euro-Atlantic integration. Yet some Ukrainian politicians are distributing fairy tales of Russian propaganda, trying to remove the aggressor’s responsibility for war, cynically translating it from Russia to Ukraine. [[Applause]] And some TV channels, newspapers, internet releases have become just untraceable pits of Russian propaganda. I share the opinion of the Head of the Supreme Council that during the election the issue of information security is one of the main issues, and that part of our information field is as occupied as part of the Ukrainian territory of the sovereign. [[Applause]] And, my friends, I\'m glad that Parliament is also aware of the depth of this problem, although it\'s not interesting to anyone. In Ukraine, the media - controlled network of Russian media agencies is still in operation, producing independent public organizations. They\'re really independent, but they\'re independent of Ukraine and controlled by the Kremlin, and they blow up. [[Applause]] Anti - Ukrainian, anti - European, and anti - American sentiments are being blown up. And so I support the idea of a bill to register agents of the influence of the Russian Federation\'s aggressor state. [[Applause]] Thus, such a law will in no way affect civil society, the media, or freedom of speech. I would also like to urge the country not to be destroyed by populism, to evaluate clearly the unprecedented complexity of the challenges and threats faced by Ukraine. Most of them don\'t have simple solutions, don\'t believe it. My own experience has taught me how important it is to be very careful and responsible about the promises you make to people. And more than four years ago, I said that ATO would last hours, not months. I regret that I had given birth to excess expectations, so a few weeks ago I apologized for giving up hope that had not come true. Of course, I apologized, but I would like this story to be a lesson not only for me but also for all Ukrainian politicians. To respond to all the risks and threats, we have a responsible choice when it comes not only to elect a President, but to choose not only a new Parliament, but to confirm precisely the invariance of our pro-European state course. Friends, until the start of the electoral cycle, there is little time left. Almost March 31st, and there are parliamentary elections ahead of time. I thank the People\'s Deputies for this week\'s adoption of the law that unlocks the process of adopting the new Central Electoral Commission. As President, I guarantee free, honest, democratic elections of the head of state, a new parliament and local self-government authorities as they were held in 14-15 years. The process of expression must be in line with our European strategy and once again recommend Ukraine as a leader in meeting the standards of democracy in post-Radians space. I am sure that the party programs have already written a promise to undo the parliamentary immunity. I insist that the relevant amendments to the Constitution be voted on without delay. He asked for the assignment, the honourable national deputies, and offered to introduce it from the following occasion. The Constitutional Court has given good and the moment of truth has come. Let us be honest with the people. And please vote. And if not, don\'t ever promise that again. That\'s fair. Dear Ukrainians, honourable national MPs, our European strategy is a two-way movement. Not only Ukraine\'s membership in the European Union, but also Ukraine\'s deep internal Europeanisation. To become a European country means to fully embrace the European spirit of political freedom, fair competition, equality of opportunity is what is called open access. The countries of Europe have been coming to him for centuries. This way, we have to keep going for 10 years at most. The Ukrainian economy needs enormous investment and new jobs to accelerate growth. In the World Bank\'s Doing Business rating, Ukraine rose 61 steps in five years. In just one year, we passed laws that directly affect the improvement of the investment climate: privatization laws have finally repealed the sad currency decree, which is 25 years old, passed the Monetary Act, limited and additional liability societies. Thank you for supporting the President\'s proposal for a ""one window"" on customs, providing macro-financial stability, the exact exit of Ukraine from the default zone. Investors noted the results of an anti-corruption strategy such as ProZorro, which was recognized by investors as the most transparent system of public procurement. Electronic automatic VAT compensation, gas sector cleaning, the creation of a High Anti-Corruption Court, etc. In $6 billion, experts estimate the effect of these anti-corruption measures. Last week, I was there to sign two big investment deals totaling almost $1 billion. It\'s just last week. One of these concerns alternative energy, which is planned to be built in the Hersonian region. Another major investment in the APC during independence will also be made in the territory of four Ukrainian regions. So foreign investors finally believe in the perspective of our country and create new jobs here. We have several world trade brands coming out one by one and probably in the sense of increasing Ukrainian purchasing power. And that\'s a positive trend that we need to step up. And before the election, we were able to pass the Tax Act on the resulting capital, which supports the Ukrainian producer. Although, to be honest, it would be more appropriate to call it the law on the tax on the withdrawal of capital. You don\'t have to get out, you put it in Ukraine. Because it stimulates investment in production. The Act on Concessions, the Act on Improving Bankruptcy, on Business Ombudsman, on Strengthening the Personal Responsibility of the Supervisory Authorities. Finally, a bill on the National Bureau of Financial Investigation is very important. Unfortunately, he was put under a dress in Parliament because he seems to be strengthening the President\'s authority, increasing. Well, of course, I\'m glad that six months before the election, I thank you for such a positive assessment of my political prospects. But it\'s different. The point is that the barriers to business are from the pressure of the whole dream of the power organs, the law enforcement agencies. We have to stop. This is fair in terms of Ukrainian business. And I, the honourable people\'s deputies, have no hope of supporting this bill, so necessary to improve the investment climate. At the same time, I realize that unfortunately, the chances of a balanced government decision to create, for example, a civilised market for land will be difficult to carry out now. If anyone is interested in how this deaf corner fits into our European strategy, he would like to remind us that the European Court of Human Rights has admitted that the moratorium on free market circulation violates the rights of Ukrainians. [[Applause]] Steps to improve the investment climate. In the eyes is the dew of God. Steps in investment climate improvement and job creation are accompanied by a continuation of employment legalization policies, an increase in wages, which in turn will enable pensions to be increased. My regulars, together with the government, with the force of encounters with business associations, employers are increasingly complaining, not about pressure, but about labour deficits. The iron curtain on the border, as in Soviet times, will not be laid. Dear employers, the only way out is to increase your wages. [[Applause]] If you want the Ukrainians not to go abroad, they\'ll work for us. In the wage market, you have to be competitive. I\'ve already talked about Ukraine becoming part of the only European labour market. And there\'s no competition kids here either. Dear Ukrainians, the smoke of war has not yet spread over this part of Europe. But through it it is clear: Ukraine can become and will be a new story of success, a new space of European growth. As one foreign friend of our country put it literally during the past four years, Ukraine has found its identity and has been established as a dynamic European force. What do we need? Be brave. This requires a vision of the future, what is called vision in English. It\'s definitely what we have. We know that there is no more compelling argument for European Ukraine than success. The next generation of Ukrainians are to pass on a successful European Ukraine. And that\'s what will happen if we don\'t put the country in the hands of the rematchers, the populists, and the demagogs. Glory to Ukraine! Thank you.']","<|system|>

22,501,22_hon_friend_her_speech,"['hon', 'friend', 'her', 'speech', 'hon friend', 'world', 'baroness', 'she', 'across', 'constituency']","['hon', 'friend', 'her', 'speech', 'hon friend', 'world', 'baroness', 'she', 'across', 'constituency']","['It is a great pleasure to reply to this debate, and I congratulate the two hon. Members who made their maiden speeches. We heard from the hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Dr Cameron), who is a local lass made good. She pointed out that our analysis reports are in the post—monitoring 649 subjects for the next five years would keep anyone busy—but, as she also pointed out, she is already busy representing her constituents. She talked about how her constituents helped others, through public services and the work that Department for International Development civil servants do in her constituency. I am sure that she is very proud of them, and they will be proud of her today. I can honestly say that “polo mint city” is a better description than Basingstoke’s, where my first job was, which was known as the doughnut—again, the reference being to roundabouts The hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw (Marion Fellows) was right to praise her family’s support during the election campaign—I am sure that she will continue to have a happy marriage. I am really impressed that she is already a Whip; that is fast promotion, indeed. I was a Whip in the previous Parliament I was surprised that the hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow denied any relationship to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, but I am sure that together they could each wear the tartan made in the constituency of her hon. Friend the Member for Motherwell and Wishaw. You never know: one day we may see a kilt or two in the Chamber, even if it is worn by you, Madam Deputy Speaker, with one of your beautiful scarves. The hon. Member for Motherwell and Wishaw also mentioned her life experience and referred to balancing the books in her professional life. I gently point out that that is what we are seeking to do, with our long-term economic plan, as we move from deficit to surplus, because at the end of the day we have to balance the books; every accountant knows that I will do my best to go through the speeches in turn. In starting the debate, my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Derbyshire (Pauline Latham) rightly brought to the House’s attention the council’s closure of the cattle market, which is to be demolished, with barely a week’s notice, and she pointed out that Derby City Council had not invested in the facility. I have heard this about other councils. It is a great shame that county towns do not recognise the heritage or the living countryside that surrounds them. It is important that county towns act for the entire county, and I suggest that she considers approaching farmers to see whether they could apply to make it an asset of community value, so that if the opportunity to buy the site comes up, they would have the option of doing so. The only other advice I can offer is that she follows this up with our colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government to see whether there are other options. In addition, the Chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, who has just spoken, will have heard her point or will read it in Hansard. The hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen), who is not in his place, referred to having a list of speakers at the back of the Speaker’s Chair. The traditional reason for not having one is to ensure that people debate, rather than just read pre-prepared speeches. The very good debate yesterday was an opportunity for people to make different points, rather than necessarily repeating the same ones. I understand that Members all have busy lives, but I particularly enjoy sitting in the Chamber and listening to our debates—I know that you do a lot of that as well, Madam Deputy Speaker. The issue, however, is probably a matter for the Procedure Committee to consider, alongside the review I hope it will conduct into our proposals on Standing Orders On English devolution, the hon. Gentleman suggested that because the Committee stage of the Scotland Bill was taken on the Floor of the House, so too should that of the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill. The Scotland Bill covers not one particular legislative area, however, but the transfer of general areas of responsibility from this Parliament to the Scottish Parliament. I am not convinced, therefore, that it is necessary to take the other Bill on the Floor of the House, but as always all Members will be able to contribute on Report, even if they were not selected for the Committee. On financial devolution and income tax assignment, he seems to have missed the fact that the coalition Government achieved a lot with the Localism Act 2011. The powers are out there and deals are being done, so I encourage him to work with his local authority in Nottingham and the Greater Nottingham area to take advantage of that The hon. Gentleman said that his constituency had the lowest number of people going to university, and I think he mentioned the removal of the maintenance grant. When we made our changes to fees in the last Parliament, it was said that the number of young people going to university would collapse and that people from poorer backgrounds would simply not go, but that has not proven to be the case. What matters, as the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) said, is ensuring that children have access to good schools and are not frightened of going to university. In that respect, the early-years preparation she mentioned does matter I now move on to the marathon speech from my hon. Friend the Member for Southend West (Sir David Amess). It was quite a canter. In fact, Southend seems to have everything except a racecourse, although I bet he is going to tell me it has a greyhound track. I do know, however, that one gets plenty of exercise if one even attempts to walk up and down the pier, which I think is the longest in the United Kingdom—but most normal human beings take a train from one end to the other I want to say something about the Chilcot inquiry. The inquiry, which is completely independent of Government, is examining a range of complex and difficult issues concerning events that ran over a period of about 10 years. Sir John Chilcot wrote to the Prime Minister on 15 June updating him on the inquiry’s position. Since January, the inquiry has received a large proportion of the responses expected from individuals who were given the opportunity to respond to provisional criticisms—something referred to as the Maxwellisation process. The responses have been constructive, and in some cases they have opened up new issues or highlighted evidence not seen before by the inquiry but which the inquiry is now considering with care In the Prime Minister’s reply, he said that he was disappointed that the inquiry was not yet able to provide a timetable for completion of its report; and as soon as Maxwellisation is completed, the Prime Minister expects to receive an update from Sir John on the timescale for the urgent completion of the inquiry. The civil service continues to be under instruction to provide every assistance to the inquiry, and Sir John agreed to meet Sir Jeremy Heywood in accordance with the Prime Minister’s wishes. I can assure my hon. Friend that the Government are very keen to see this report published. I know that many around the House are as impatient as he is to get it My hon. Friend made a number of different points. On Southend airport and his constituent’s problems with noise pollution, I suggest that if he has not already done so—I am sure he has, as I know he is an assiduous Member—he should contact the aviation Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill) On the point about the National Deaf Children’s Society and the allocation of Ofsted inspectors who have experience of the needs of the deaf, the training and allocation of the inspectors is, of course, a matter for Her Majesty’s chief inspector, but I know that this chief inspector takes very seriously the need to ensure that inspectors have the appropriate skills and knowledge to perform their role. I understand that those who inspect specialist provision will have had previous relevant experience in teaching and leadership, and will undertake additional Ofsted training. I am also aware that where a school has a specialist unit for deaf children, inspectors will establish in the pre-inspection conversation with the school whether a British sign language interpreter is required when meetings pupils. When it comes to mainstream schools, a requirement for all inspectors to have experience or specialist training in respect of people who are deaf or hearing impaired was seen to raise very significant cost and efficiency issues, as well as practical ones. For that reason, I understand that Ofsted has no plans to make further changes to its arrangements at present My hon. Friend the Member for Southend West referred to the wild animals in circuses Bill. He will know that there was a commitment in our manifesto, and the Government are committed to bringing in this legislation when parliamentary time allows. I am sure he will be pleased to know that the interim licensing scheme is ensuring good welfare for the 18 wild animals being used by the two travelling circuses On the NHS agency staff bill, my hon. Friend will be aware of the action already taken by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health. It is an important issue that probably affects every health trust in all parts of the United Kingdom, so my hon. Friend is right to raise it on behalf of his local hospitals My hon. Friend referred to the promotion of Southend United. I congratulate the team on that. The last time I saw Southend United play was when I was a parliamentary candidate for Wrexham, and I am afraid Southend lost to Wrexham in the Johnstone’s Paint trophy. All I can say is that Wrexham ain’t anywhere near where Southend United is in the football league nowadays I hope I have covered a good number of the points that my hon. Friend raised. He is right to talk about VisitEngland and to want to improve tourism outside London. I am sure he will welcome the fact that as we speak many tourists will be heading up to my constituency to enjoy the Latitude festival. I hope that the weather stays good for them. The sun always shines in Southend, and it usually does in Suffolk, too. I am sure, finally, that other hon. Members will join me in congratulating my hon. Friend, who I am sure will enjoy his investiture at Windsor castle tomorrow The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) raised a number of points. She mentioned open-cast mines. I understand that the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, met Carl Sergeant of the Welsh Assembly Government today to discuss issues relating to open-cast mines, including the Parc Slip west site. My hon. Friend has agreed to have further conversations about options to deal with the site and possible sources of funding The hon. Lady raised the issue of continence. I do not know whether the event she mentioned is still happening as we speak—possibly not. I recognise the need for nationwide improvements in continence care. This has led to the continence care programme, which is aligned with the national compassion in practice strategy. NHS England is leading a national programme of work in this area. I am not aware of what is happening in Wales in that regard, but the hon. Lady will appreciate that she can have direct conversations with the appropriate people in the Welsh Assembly Government I understand the hon. Lady’s frustration about tier 4 student visas, because there is a similar issue in my constituency. As I am sure she will recognise, acquiring student visas used to be one of the main ways in which people managed to overstay, and I understand that very careful deliberation is taking place about all the different applications that are being made. Nevertheless, I hope that the Home Office will move as quickly as possible to satisfy her local college and, indeed, mine. I am sure that my Home Office colleagues have noted my issue as well My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) asked about Equitable Life. I was proud to be part of a governing party that ensured that compensation was provided, and that further compensation was given to those on pension credit. I understand the point that my hon. Friend made, but I am not aware that the Treasury has any plans to extend the compensation regime any further My hon. Friend also expressed concern that the public health funds given to councils were not being used for their intended purposes. Public Health England continues to issue targets against which councils are measured, but one of the purposes of giving councils public health funding was to address local needs and ensure the provision of not only immediate but long-term public health benefits, and I think that that should be respected. If my hon. Friend wishes to raise any specific local issues, I am sure that he will be able to do so directly, either with my colleagues or with councils themselves The hon. Member for Walsall South (Valerie Vaz)—or, as she accurately said, “hon. Friend” outside the Chamber —was right to highlight problems relating to traffic jams and productivity. Having checked on my phone earlier, I know that, as we speak, there are just big red lines on the southbound section of the M6 in her constituency. I grew up in Liverpool and some members of my family still live there, while others live in parts of north Wales, so I am a regular traveller up the M6. I share the hon. Lady’s frustration, which is why I do not use that road any more According to the Department for Transport, the entry road at junction 9 has been closed to help to prevent gridlock on local roads in Walsall. If the road were kept open, traffic would have to queue to access the M5 link road, which currently has only one lane available owing to vital repair work on the carriageway. Queues would build up quickly and result in heavy congestion on the M6, which would back up into other roads in Walsall—although the hon. Lady seems to think that that is already happening. I understand that Highways England has discussed the matter in depth with Sandwell and Walsall councils, and that they understand the need to prevent needless congestion for local drivers The hon. Lady said that no work seemed to be being carried out on the entry road, and she was absolutely right. The road has been closed not so that repairs can be carried out, but with a view to preventing gridlock on the M6 and local roads around Walsall. However, I am sure that the authorities will take careful note of what she has said today, and will look at the issue again The hon. Lady mentioned traffic-calming measures in Walstead Road, and the need for a 20 mph zone in Monmouth Road. As she knows, her local council must tackle the issue, but she is has plenty of experience in that regard, and she was right to raise it on behalf of her constituents today As for the education centre that the hon. Lady mentioned, I agree with her that it will be a great result. I was not invited to the opening of the centre, so I feel a bit left out, but I shall be sure to go and see it on Monday. The hon. Lady also mentioned the travel subsidy. Unfortunately for me, it is for those outside the M25. Children from Suffolk do not benefit from the subsidy, and I assure the hon. Lady that those in Lowestoft, which is not in my constituency but 130 miles away, do not benefit from it either. As a result, not many schools in my constituency come here. However, I am sure that the excellent new centre will help My hon. Friend the Member for South Ribble (Seema Kennedy) spoke passionately about her role as a breast cancer ambassador. She was right to do so, on behalf of her constituents, but also because of the need to continue to raise awareness. The independent cancer taskforce has developed a five-year strategy for cancer services with the aim of improving survival rates and saving more lives. The strategy will recommend improvements along the cancer pathway, and is expected to be published later this month. We will work with the NHS, charities and patient groups to deliver that My hon. Friend also referred to the Iran nuclear deal. After more than a decade of tough negotiations, we have reached an historic agreement aimed at ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme is and remains exclusively peaceful, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will be grateful for her praise. She also raised the important issue of the number of older people living alone and the isolation that many of them feel. I am not aware of exactly what we are doing on that, but I am sure that her concerns can be addressed in future Question Time opportunities The hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden spoke passionately about the need for social mobility. She referred to the parental link, the privileged professions and the link to private schools. She mentioned early years provision in an intervention on the hon. Member for Nottingham North. Her Majesty’s chief inspector of education published the annual report on the early years sector for Parliament on 13 July—just a few days ago. It shows a positive picture overall, welcomes the Government’s major new investment in free childcare for working parents and highlights the fact that the quality of all types of early-years provision is at its highest ever. We are absolutely committed to continuing to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds, which is why we offer 15 hours of completely free childcare On the question of social mobility, I can tell the hon. Lady that one of the things that drives this Government is ensuring that every child has a good early start and goes to a good school. We are passionate about keeping that going, because it matters. We only have one chance of being a child and getting that education, and she is right to champion that issue. I can assure her that this Government are on the side of those who want to get on and do the right thing The hon. Lady talked about the certificate in knowledge of policing now costing £1,000. It is my understanding that special constables, certainly in the Metropolitan police, do not need the certificate. The Met is also open to providing interest-free loans. I do not particularly want to become a tax lawyer at the Dispatch Box, but my personal experience would lead me to expect that people who see the benefit of investing in such a certificate would be able to deduct the cost as a fully allowable expense.', 'My Lords, it is a huge privilege and a pleasure to have the job of closing this debate, which ends the debates in your Lordships’ House on Her Majesty’s gracious Speech. We are on day four of those debates, and today we are just shy of another six hours of debate, with 50 speakers. Looking around the Chamber, I can detect a palpable sense of relief that we are nearing a conclusion. I am reminded of what Churchill once said: “The head cannot take in more than the seat can endure” Perhaps many of us feel that. Although it has been quite a long haul, it has been an absorbing debate, covering five departments. It has been an extensive, thought-provoking and well-informed debate across the Chamber I take this opportunity to thank my noble friend Lord O’Neill, who opened the debate so eloquently. I also thank my noble friend Lady Williams for her support from the Front Bench It would be remiss of me not to immediately align myself with the many comments that have been made in congratulating the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle on her excellent maiden speech. As we all know, delivering a first speech in this House is quite an achievement, but doing so in such a high-profile debate is doubly impressive. We have learned a great deal about the right reverend Prelate, including the fact that she is a marathon runner. I welcome her to her first marathon in your Lordships’ House, although, as she will appreciate, this is one that you have to do sitting down. She has already made a significant contribution to the diversity of the House. As we all know, she is the second woman Church of England Bishop to take a seat in your Lordships’ House. I know I speak for everyone across the Chamber and beyond when I extend the warmest of welcomes to her. I look forward to working with her on a range of issues in the coming months and years I also wish to thank all noble Lords who have contributed today, and over the past few days, to the debate on the gracious Speech. We are blessed with the experience and wise words of your Lordships’ House I begin by touching on the EU referendum. The noble Baronesses, Lady Bakewell, Lady Bowles and Lady Kramer, the noble Lord, Lord Cotter, and others talked about the EU referendum—in or out. As I have said from the Dispatch Box, the Government’s position is absolutely clear that the United Kingdom’s place in a stronger, safer and more prosperous Europe is within the European Union. It is just shy of a month until the referendum and I hope that the debate that takes place in the next few weeks, irrespective of which side one is on, is based on the facts and not on fear or fiction Her Majesty’s gracious Speech was about building a stronger, more resilient, more secure and more modern Britain. I cannot agree with some noble Lords who suggested that this is not happening. We believe that hard work should be rewarded and opportunity enjoyed at every stage of life by all, in a country fit for the future, no matter what challenges we face. If we have learned anything from the past decade, it is that we need to be more responsible during times of plenty, living within our means—a point well made by my noble friend Lord Flight—bearing down on our debts and planning for a surplus so that we can cope during difficult times. Certainly we will take no lessons from the last Labour Government who left what was a pretty big mess before the coalition Government took up the reins In the last Parliament, we had to make some tough economic decisions, but they were the right economic decisions. They helped make us one of the fastest-growing major advanced economies in the world. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, perhaps painted a rather bleak picture. However, new figures published last week show that more people are in work than ever before: 31.5 million people in the United Kingdom have jobs. That means that the employment rate has risen to 74.2%, the highest since records began in 1971. The deficit is down by almost two thirds as a share of GDP and the OBR forecast is that it will be eliminated by 2019-20. However, I accept, as several noble Lords have pointed out, that there is more to do and our work is not yet complete. That is why, with the global economy slowing, it is even more vital that we stick to the long-term strategy behind our economic plan. Let me assure noble Lords that this Government will continue to focus on that as our main objective If I may, I will take each area in turn. I say at the outset that if there are questions that remain unanswered by the time I have finished my contribution, I will of course write to noble Lords Among others, the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, and the noble Lords, Lord Rana and Lord Smith, as well as my noble friends Lord Flight and Lord Leigh, raised the issue of tax avoidance, et cetera. The Government established the Pensions Regulator as an independent body to provide effective and proportionate regulatory oversight of work-based pension schemes. We have already announced that during this Parliament we will legislate for over 25 further measures on avoidance, evasion and aggressive tax planning that are forecast to raise £16 billion by 2021. We have also given HMRC an extra £800 million to fund additional work to tackle tax evasion and non-compliance by 2020-21. The UK’s percentage tax gap is also one of the lowest in the world. In 2009-10, the tax gap was 7.3%; in the first four years of the last Parliament, it fell to 6.4% The City of London came under some scrutiny during various contributions. However, we should be proud of the City of London. It is world-beating, and we need to ensure its competitiveness on the world stage We are committed to supporting savers at all stages of their lives. We have already made ISAs more generous and flexible, resulting in more than £20 billion more saved in ISAs in 2014-15 compared with the previous year. But the noble Baroness made some important points about the importance of financial literacy in education. That is certainly something that the Government continue to work on The noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, and the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, raised the issue of steel. It should suffice for me to say that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, as many know, was in India today. He has been involved in important discussions in this respect. I am sure that the House will be updated in due course The noble Lords, Lord McFall and Lord Oates, talked about the banking sector and particularly issues of transparency and accountability. Earlier this month, Parliament passed the Bank of England and Financial Services Act, which will fundamentally reform the financial sector. Notably, as many noble Lords will know, it will strengthen the governance, transparency and accountability of the Bank of England. It will also ensure that senior managers across the financial services industry can be held accountable for failings on their watch through the extension of the senior managers and certification regime My noble friend Lord Leigh asked a question about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement which is currently being negotiated by the EU and the US. The recent amendment tabled on TTIP in the other place to the Motion supporting the Queen’s Speech was prompted by concerns that TTIP is a threat to the National Health Service, but the Government are quite clear that it is not a threat. I assure noble Lords that when it comes to issues around the economy, it remains a key priority for this Government and we aim to continue to build an even stronger, more resilient and prosperous Britain fit for all and fit for the future I turn to several cross-departmental themes. We have heard today about the work across five different departments and how this is helping to prepare Britain for the challenges ahead. What this debate has shown is that as we embark on the second year of this Parliament, strong themes connect each department and apply right across government. We will be looking at overhauling planning, giving cities and regions power over their destinies and rebalancing our economic geography, so we can share growth and opportunity across the United Kingdom. I accept the point that has been made that for far too long, the focus has been concentrated in the south-east The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle, in her maiden speech, along with other noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Shipley and Lord Shutt, also raised the issue of the northern powerhouse. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, specifically, that much is happening on the northern powerhouse. The Government are investing £20 million a year in the northern powerhouse skills strategy, for example, committing £161 million to accelerate the transformation of the M62, and £75 million to improve other road links across the north. From May 2017, 54% of the population of the north will be covered by elected mayors, backed with over £4 million of new funding. That will give local areas control over key powers including skills, transport and housing. That is perhaps why the shadow Home Secretary wants to put himself forward as the mayor of Manchester. Perhaps he needs to reflect on his own Front Bench responsibilities vis-a-vis the opportunities that are being offered to all from our decision to devolve powers There was a question about this Government but let me assure noble Lords that I only need to look to my left and right to see strong powerful advocates for the north. I assure noble Lords that the Government are also well represented across the board in ensuring that we build a stronger economy across the whole of the country. The noble Lord, Lord Shipley, made a point about Gateshead. Of course we will be speaking to Gateshead because it is important that we see collaboration in our regions. The noble Lords, Lord Shutt, Lord Kirkham and Lord Giddens, also raised issues about the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act that made its way through Parliament and will pave the way for places to take greater control and responsibility over policies such as transport, housing, skills, and key public services such as health and social care I can also assure noble Lords that in this year’s Budget the Chancellor gave a green light to HS3 between Leeds and Manchester, along with £60 million to develop detailed plans to reduce journey times as well as plans for the rest of the northern powerhouse rail network. Moreover, the Government have committed £150 million to implementing smart and integrated ticketing and £50 million to Transport for the North over the lifetime of this Parliament Perhaps I may turn to the DCLG. There are two new Bills which we have talked about today. We have already seen a revolution in neighbourhood planning, with 193 plans approved involving nearly 2,000 groups and covering around 10 million people. The new neighbourhood planning and infrastructure Bill will further empower communities, and let me assure my noble friend Lady Scott of Bybrook that it will give them a stronger voice while getting houses and infrastructure delivered as quickly and efficiently as possible. The Bill will also support our ambition to build 1 million new homes while protecting what we value the most—the green belt Several noble Lords, including the noble Baronesses, Lady Bakewell and Lady Thornhill, raised issues about housing and new homes. Reforms have already resulted in the granting of planning permissions for 253,000 homes in the past year. However, this debate has again illustrated how much further we want to go so that everyone who works hard in this country can have a home of their own. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornhill, also asked about affordable social housing. I assure her that we have protected the visibility of homelessness prevention by funding local authorities to receive support totalling £315 million by 2019-20 I turn to other housing and planning matters. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, talked about moneys which are being handed back through provisions we are making in business rates revenue which currently stand at around £26 billion. These reforms will mean that all income from local taxes will go on funding local services. The Government remain focused on delivering 1 million new homes of all different types and tenures, making neighbourhood planning an even simpler and more streamlined process. The noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, talked about housing, planning and flood defences. We have delivered more than 277,000 affordable homes since April 2010 and we have committed to spending £8 billion to deliver 400,000 affordable homes by 2020-21. With regard to flooding raised in the context of pre-commencement planning conditions, the measures would not restrict the ability of local planning authorities to propose conditions that are necessary The second new Bill is the local growth and jobs Bill. We have seen a radical effect on local government in this country. It would allow us to fulfil our commitment to devolve spending to the regions so that local government as a sector can retain 100% of local taxes to spend on services by the end of this Parliament. Various other questions were raised by my noble friends Lord Young and Lord Caithness around issues related to homelessness and CPOs. Perhaps I may write to noble Lords in those respects. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, also raised an issue about adult social care funding. The Government are committed to providing support of up to £3.5 billion to ensure that councils are able to support their oldest and most vulnerable residents The noble Lord, Lord Shipley, talked about housing inequalities in the proposed Bills and why there can be devolved mayors in some areas but not others. If business rates are not sufficient to fund the local authority in an area, it will be necessary for the Government to adjust for those areas. On his other related questions, I shall of course write to him My noble friend Lord Kirkham talked about online companies and business rates, as well as the privatisation of the Land Registry mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. Again, in the interests of time I shall write to both noble Lords and copy in others I turn briefly to energy and climate change. We will introduce measures to deliver our manifesto commitment to increase competition and consumer choice in the energy market. The Government want to give consumers more power and choice through faster switching and more protection when things go wrong. Between 2010 and 2015 we reduced the UK’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 17%, the biggest reduction in a single Parliament. Moreover in Paris last year, as several noble Lords noted, we secured the first truly global legally binding agreement to tackle climate change. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, and the noble Lord, Lord Morris, also talked about climate change. It is right to say that Paris was a great success and I pay tribute to my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Amber Rudd, in this respect. The UK will provide £5.8 billion in climate finance over the next five years—50% more than the previous spending review—and has a clear plan of carbon budgets to reduce emissions The noble Lord, Lord Stunell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, also raised a question about action on climate change. It is not true to say that we are not ambitious on climate change. We are phasing out coal, investing in renewable heat technologies, insulating 1 million homes and offering smart meters to every home by 2020. My noble friend Lord Holmes asked about Hinkley Point. It is not often I say this to my noble friend but I disagree with him. Hinkley Point is a vital part of our energy strategy. It will provide reliable energy at affordable costs, powering nearly 6 million homes for 60 years, and creating 25,000 jobs. The noble Lord, Lord Bruce, raised issues about supporting the oil and gas industry. The Government remain committed to supporting that industry, which plays a vital role towards our energy supplies Turning briefly to Defra, we are setting out ambitious plans to protect Britain’s environment to boost our farming and food industry. Defra’s 25-year vision is to make this country one of the healthiest and most beautiful places in which to live and raise a family. Our specific commitments include planting 11 million trees, completing a blue-belt network on marine protected areas by 2020, establishing clean air zones for five English cities and an ultra-low emission zone for London. We have seen growth across our economy over the past six years. While rural districts already generate billions of pounds for the UK, we are determined to do more to support jobs and opportunities in the countryside The food and the farming industry is an £109 billion industry that provides employment for 3.9 million people. Defra, as I have said, is currently finalising a 25-year plan for Britain’s food and farming industry. The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, and other noble Lords, also raised issues about GM crops, and I will write in that respect and with regard to questions raised by the noble Baronesses, Lady Parminter and Lady Featherstone, on the dairy industry The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, also raised the issue of abstraction reform in the Queen’s Speech. In January 2016, the Government set out their proposed approach to reforming the abstraction system. I can assure the noble Baroness that the Government remain committed to implementing reform in the early 2020s. The noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Trees, talked about the review of the EU birds directive. The UK Government want to ensure that the fitness check of the habitats and wild birds directive is both robust and maintains a momentum, and leads to positive changes for both business and wildlife. There are various other issues relating to Defra which my noble friend Lord Inglewood also raised, and I shall, of course, write in that respect, too Turning finally to transport—they say you should leave your own until last—for decades, we have seen Britain slipping down the global infrastructure league table. We have watched as our roads grow more congested, trains become more overcrowded, and our towns choked with traffic. Now we are climbing the infrastructure league table. We are ahead of France, Japan and Germany. Overall transport spending will rise 50% this Parliament. That means we can invest more than £15 billion to maintain and improve our roads, and we are spending more than £38 billion—the greatest expenditure on our railways since the Victorian era HS2—I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, and others for their support—remains at the centre of our transport revolution. It is the biggest infrastructure scheme since the motorways. It will provide extra capacity and the connectivity we need to meet growing demand Mention was also made of the infrastructure commission. This is a start for infrastructure that will make Britain one of the world’s leading transport investors. Her Majesty’s gracious Speech also supports legislation to establish the independent National Infrastructure Commission on a statutory basis. Indeed, the commission’s influence is already being felt. I assure noble Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, that, following its recommendations, we have already invested £300 million to improve northern transport connectivity. I also assure the noble Lord, Lord Kirkham, and my noble friend Lord Caithness that we have given the green light to HS3 between Leeds and Manchester, and allocated £80 million to help fund the development of Crossrail 2. A point was made about promises not being delivered. Construction of Crossrail 1—or the Elizabeth line, as it will now be called—is more than 70% complete. It is on time and on budget Another Bill that will be introduced under transport is, of course, the modern transport Bill, which featured in Her Majesty’s gracious Speech. It is focused on the future—a Bill to pave the way for the technologies and transport of tomorrow. Some specific points were made, which I of course acknowledge—I welcome the constructive comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, in that respect—while others perhaps questioned the merits of a spaceport before other infrastructure projects have taken place. It is important to emphasise that many of these things can run in parallel and that we should not take away from a sector that will be important to the UK’s positioning in the years ahead Many comments were made about the Bus Services Bill. I will not dwell too long on that. Suffice to say that I welcome the interaction we have had thus far with noble Lords. Yesterday we held a very constructive meeting. I underline again the Government’s intent to engage fully on ensuring that the Bus Services Bill truly does provide the new powers to local authorities to improve bus services and increase passenger numbers. It is our belief that stronger partnerships will allow authorities to agree a new set of standards for bus services. I look forward to working with all noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Attlee and the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, among others, to ensure a positive passage for this Bill through this House. It will receive its Second Reading I believe—I look towards the Chief Whip—on 8 June when we come back from the Recess I will give an assurance to noble Lords. Other questions have been raised on transport and other areas that we have covered today, but I feel that my popularity—if, indeed, I have much remaining—may be much lower if I carry on for much longer, not least with my two noble friends who sit behind me. Let me assure all noble Lords that the Government welcome, through the debate that we had today and over the last few days, the contribution of all noble Lords. We accept that it is for the Government to make their case for their Bills in this Chamber and in the other place, but we look forward to a constructive dialogue with all noble Lords across the Chamber to ensure that we move forward on our legislation To conclude, let me assure noble Lords that this is a Government who put the national interest before anything else, and nothing is more important to our national interest than a strong, stable and growing economy—one which provides the opportunities that people need to get on and achieve their ambitions. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Portsmouth reminded us in his very thoughtful contribution, mention has been made of other places. Indeed, the Trump factor has been talked about. Do you know what? I am proud of Britain. Notwithstanding the challenges that we have, we provide opportunity for all. It does not matter who you are, where you come from or what background, culture, community or faith you have: you have an opportunity to progress. Those are the kinds of values that this Government wish to protect. I know that that is a sentiment shared across the Chamber A strong, stable and growing economy provides the jobs that families need to feel secure and the services that communities and businesses rely on. But what this debate over the past week has shown me clearly is that we are looking forward beyond the economic recovery, making the reforms that will deliver the long-term prosperity that our nation needs. As I said, I look forward to engagement across the House in this respect, and not just in the area of transport—I speak for all my colleagues in government. We look forward to our exchanges in this Chamber and beyond to ensure that, together, we make Britain a stronger, safer, more competitive nation, with the infrastructure to ensure that it remains a leader among the nations of the world.', 'It is an honour to address this House on behalf of the Government and to close this debate on Britain in the world. I am grateful for the insightful contributions from all the right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken, and I will try to respond to as many of the points raised as I can. I am particularly delighted to welcome the maiden speeches from new Members—my hon. Friends the Members for Delyn (Rob Roberts) and for Rutland and Melton (Alicia Kearns), the hon. Member for St Albans (Daisy Cooper), and my hon. Friends the Members for Stafford (Theo Clarke) and for Wakefield (Imran Ahmad Khan) For me, my hon. Friend the new Member for Stafford is a familiar face, as I have met her several times in her former role as chief executive and founder of the cross-party Coalition for Global Prosperity. She paid full and deserved tribute to her predecessor, Jeremy Lefroy, whose expertise in international development was respected across this House. She has already proven herself as a powerful advocate of Britain’s global role in promoting international development, and I think the people of Stafford will be incredibly well served by her It is appropriate that my hon. Friend the new Member for Wakefield made his maiden speech in this debate, given his wide experience around the world—and we “Agadoo” warmly welcome him. [Laughter. ] He is the first Ahmadiyya Muslim ever elected to this place, which is an important first and consistent with our party’s record as one of opportunity. His experience advising a range of Governments across the world will I hope be extended to offering me some helpful tips, and I hope he will not mind if I try to parachute him in from time to time My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton has a tough act to follow in Sir Alan Duncan, but her maiden speech has been rightly praised from both sides of the House I am sure all Members will agree with her remarks on serving our constituents to the best of our abilities. She also made several telling comments about the complex nature of the diplomatic and national security challenges we face today. I welcome the expertise she brings to this and look forward to her contribution in future debates on this topic My hon. Friend the new Member for Delyn spoke persuasively about our Union and Wales’s place in Britain, largely speaking without notes. It is excellent to see more Conservative representatives from Wales, and particularly from constituencies with large aerospace factories, in his case Airbus, in mine Rolls-Royce. As he said, we are now truly the party of the workers. He spoke warmly about his predecessor, who was, indeed, well respected across the House, as I feel sure my hon. Friend will be I also welcome the contribution from the hon. Member for St Albans. As someone who lives next door to a pub, I welcomed the focus of her remarks. I can assure her that the Government will keep Britain open—open to business and open to collaboration on science and climate change. She paid a generous tribute to her predecessor, Anne Main. Anne was one of this House’s leading advocates for the Bangladeshi community and for persecuted Rohingya Muslims. I pay tribute to Anne for her work, and I am sure the hon. Lady and other Members around the House will continue with that work in this Parliament This Government are immensely proud of Britain’s role in the world—in history, now, and in the new role we will play as we get Brexit done and unleash the potential of this country. My right hon. Friend the International Development Secretary is in Kenya today meeting the Kenyan President to discuss the huge potential of closer partnership between our countries. I have just this morning returned from Africa—I was pleased to visit Angola, Uganda and Namibia—where I discussed deepening our trading partnerships with those countries. Relationships that boost British business but also strengthen countries across Africa are very important, and that point was made by several Members in this debate. Supporting countries’ economic growth to help them become self-sustaining is their best route out of poverty As we leave the European Union, we will embark on a new chapter in our country’s history, deciding for ourselves our own priorities and negotiating our own trade deals—deals that will be fair as well as free. We will strengthen our links with the Commonwealth, which boasts some of the most dynamic economies around the world. The African investment summit we are holding in London next week was mentioned by the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Theo Clarke). It will create lasting partnerships that will deliver investment, jobs and growth across Africa and in the UK As a responsible world-leading nation, from promoting the rights of girls to be educated or combating the devastating effects of climate change to responding to the biggest health issues around the world, we are a country that leads on the world stage. We are the only major country that meets both the NATO target of spending 2% of our GDP on defence and the target of spending 0.7% of GNI on international development. They are targets this Government will honour, and that is only possible with a strong economy We should be proud of the role that Britain plays in the world; where we lead, others follow. When countries call for support, Britain answers. The UK is a development superpower; our global leadership projects our values and helps to protect our interests and secure our place in the world. Development is also central to our role in bolstering the rules-based international system, a role the UK is committed to, as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear in his remarks earlier After Brexit, we will bolster our crucial international alliances and institutions. We will stand up and be counted in the United Nations Security Council, the UN, NATO, the Commonwealth, the G20, the G7 and the World Trade Organisation. We are proud of our peace-building and humanitarian efforts around the world. We are proud of our record in helping reduce global poverty and helping to save lives around the world. Building on those efforts, we will aim to end the preventable deaths of mothers, babies and children by 2030. This means ending malaria, one of the leading causes of death in children under five, and ending Ebola as a public health threat. It also means supporting the development and deployment of vaccines; an important signal of our commitment will be when we host Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance global replenishment conference in June Under this Conservative Government, the UK will continue to play a leading role in fighting for the rights of women and girls. Investing in girls’ education helps to boost women in the workforce. It boosts economic growth and prevents child marriage and early pregnancy. We will stand up for the right of every girl in the world to have 12 years of quality education, one of the most basic human rights—the right to a decent education. We will strengthen our role protecting human rights around the world by further developing an independent sanctions regime to tackle those who abuse them. We will continue our campaign to promote international media freedom and to end human trafficking and modern slavery. We will continue to promote and protect LGBT rights, including as Equal Rights Coalition chair, and we will host an international LGBT conference in May. We will seek to protect those persecuted for their faith and implement the Truro review recommendations, a topic eloquently raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield Another area on which the United Kingdom proudly leads the world is climate change and biodiversity loss. We were the first major economy to legislate for net zero emissions, and we will deliver by 2050. We have already reduced our carbon emissions by 43% since 1990. We have doubled the support we offer developing nations to tackle climate change and, as hosts of the UN climate change summit in Glasgow this November, we will ensure that we continue to provide global leadership. We will build new international partnerships to tackle deforestation and to protect landscapes and wildlife. We will establish a new £500 million blue planet fund to help to protect our oceans from plastic pollution, overfishing and rising sea temperatures, something rightly referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Crawley (Henry Smith) Turning to a few more points raised during the debate, my right hon. Friend the Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale) spoke passionately about the importance of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in bringing parliamentarians together, and the role of the British Council and the BBC World Service. I could not agree more. His comments on media freedom and the number of journalists killed or still in jail really brought home why this is a top priority for the United Kingdom My right hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) spoke eloquently about the importance of defence spending, an area in which he has considerable expertise. As part of the spending round 2019, the Government committed to an additional £2.2 billion of funding for defence this year. That recognises the critical role defence plays in ensuring the safety and security of British people at home and abroad, supporting our allies, projecting influence and promoting UK prosperity. However, I appreciate, as always, that he will want us to go further My hon. Friend the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Tom Tugendhat), who so ably chaired the Foreign Affairs Select Committee for the past two years, spoke of the need to build new partnerships while remaining vigilant about the threat from China and Russia. He also reminded us that Britain will remain in Europe—Europe is not Brussels I am delighted to welcome back to this place my hon. Friend the Member for Meon Valley (Mrs Drummond), who rightly paid warm and deserved tribute to her predecessor, Sir George Hollingbery. She spoke with real knowledge about soft power. I am delighted that we are helping to re-establish the all-party group on Yemen My right hon. Friend the Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) spoke with passion about defence infrastructure and, most importantly, the benefits of democracy. That is particularly apt exactly one month on from a sleepless night for all of us My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr Baker) spoke about the need to prioritise a free trade agreement with the USA. As he knows, we intend to secure a deal with the EU by the end of December, but there is a strong rationale for us to progress trade negotiations with the US from 31 January, as he said today and so eloquently set out in his recent article in The Daily Telegraph Having just returned last week from visiting the Commonwealth countries Namibia and Uganda and visiting Angola, which has applied to join the Commonwealth, I strongly agree with the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Andrew Rosindell) about the importance of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth was also touched on by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman), who has always been a strong advocate of strengthening and deepening our ties with India My hon. Friend the Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie) reminded us why as the UK we are stronger together and of the fact that the UK was the first country in the G7 to hit the UN target of spending 0.7% on overseas development. My hon. Friend the Member for Henley (John Howell) reminded us of the importance of the Council of Europe and the issues that are discussed there. He is correct when he says that there is a lack of understanding about the Council of Europe. However, I hope that he accepts and understands that, as a former pairing Whip who used to try to move heaven and earth to get him and other people there, I do get it My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Bob Seely) spoke about his concerns over Huawei. The final decision on high-risk vendors will be taken in due course and the Government will consider the full range of risks when making that decision In conclusion, the Queen’s Speech lays out our ambitious, optimistic and bold vision for our new place in the world. This new vision builds on the work of the British people—their work in making our country world-leading, whether that is British medics who spent their Christmas fighting a deadly measles outbreak in Samoa, or our world-leading climate change scientists and clean energy pioneers whose endeavours will benefit from our new £1 billion Ayrton fund, or the brave men and women of our armed forces who, in 2019, were involved in 35 operations across 30 countries.']","<|system|>

State Secretary, Director, Representatives and Representatives. We can say that avoiding waste production is the first choice we have in environmental protection, but everything we spend sooner or later turns into waste. Therefore, in waste management, waste prevention and reuse should be our priority. According to the available data I have from 2017. 46% of municipal waste in the EU is recycled and composted. Croatia unfortunately does so in a significantly smaller percentage. However, we must say that practices differ from state to state and that some countries still use in most cases the disposal of municipal waste to landfills. The wealthier countries of this tourism-related country produce more waste. Although municipal waste accounts for less than a tenth of 2.5 billion tonnes of waste produced in the EU each year, a complex problem is visible, primarily due to the composition of the waste source and the link to the consumption patterns. The EU has set very ambitious targets for the recycling of disposal, but it has placed dumps itself in order to boost the transition to a circular economy and a new action plan has also been adopted in this respect, seeking additional measures to achieve carbon neutral, ecologically sustainable, non-toxic and complete circular economy by 2050. including stricter recycling rules. Member States should increase high-quality recycling, remove waste disposal and reduce combustion to the minimum possible extent. In Croatia, there has been an increase in separate waste collection by 11% and a reduction in delays of 18% over the past four years. So we're still moving forward. But the effects of current climate and environmental consumption patterns are high, energy consumption is increasing, CO2 emissions are being increased and, in fact, the introduction of a circular economy principle would reduce environmental pressure, increase the security of supply of raw materials, competitiveness and innovation, strengthen economic growth, even some of the assessments that I came up with to be 0.5% of GDP and certainly create new jobs, consumers would have longer, more sustainable and more valuable products. I am saying all these arguments because it seems to me that we are still not fully aware of why it is so important to have a sustainable and circular management of waste, and this is what the data shows, we see that we are lagging behind in Croatia for the EU's waste reduction targets, mainly because of the poor technical and financial capacities of cities and municipalities for the collection and separation of waste and the promotion of recycling. Turning waste into resources is actually the essence of the circular economy, if we re-product and recycle, and if the waste of one sector becomes raw material of another sector, then we can get closer to a circular economy where waste is reduced to the least possible measure and resources are used efficiently and sustainablely. By improving waste management, we can reduce health and environmental problems, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid negative effects at local level, such as disturbance of landscapes due to waste disposal and pollution of water and air. Croatia needs to achieve sustainable waste management, in this we are all complex, speed up recycling, limit the use of landfills and create incentives for changes in consumer behaviour, and this law will also help us. So the state gives us a legal framework, but we, of course, must also put forth efforts and urgently change our behavior. I have already mentioned, I will say once again, at the local level, situations where, due to the lack of awareness of individuals on the one hand, due to the inadequate response of the system on the other hand, some of our citizens, instead of collecting waste separately, to be taken care of by municipal companies in an inappropriate way, to burn plastics, to throw waste into the woods, local water streams, all of this has far-reaching consequences, and if we know that every resident produces 440 kilograms annually on average of waste, then I am always surprised that someone responsible is not wondering where this waste ended, if it is not committed to a competent municipal enterprise, so I appeal to a stronger activity of municipal directors and environmental inspection in these cases."", 'Thank you, President. Good morning. Ladies and gentlemen, let us bring to this House today the project of what will be the future Waste and Contaminated Lands Act of Galicia, a text that is supposed to fulfill our commitment to Galicia, to the Green Galicia, to the future Galicia, to the sustainable Galicia, to the resilient Galicia, to the Galicia that fights climate change. So we started updating and adapting the law after twelve years in which everything changed, both how to consume and how to generate waste and how to manage it. What we want is to provide Galicia with a new legal framework adapted to Community legislation, which is complete, clear and legally safe. We are aware of the need to adapt legislation to the changing model that is being experimented, a system that walks towards a circular economy and is called to be the only model of the future possible in Galicia. In fact, in the last decade Galicia has always been close to and in the vanguard of European waste planning. Thus, in 2010 we designed the Galician Urban Waste Management Plan, which allowed our community to be able to move towards a new design of waste policies. In 2016 we approved the Industrial Waste Plan of Galicia, the PRIGA. He will be alive until 2022 and will allow them to assess how these wastes are being managed and whether his generation is becoming independent of economic growth. I have to inform you that you will soon see the first PRIGA report, which analyses from 2016 to 2018 — the latest data we have on 2018 — and in which we have authorized a total of 750 plants. From 2016 to 2018 industrial waste decreased by 8.5%. We are destined for recycling and recovery of a total of 82% of Galicia\'s industrial waste, and its disposal, 18%. This means that we not only plan the results, but we are aware of the results, which are the ones that are now transcending and that we will soon introduce: in 2016, 3 million tons of industrial waste; in 2018, 2.8 million tons — of which recycling is destined to 82% —; in 2019 we have two milestones, two important keys: the first is that we gave green light to the Strategy of Climate Change and Energy 2050 and the second is that we approve the Welsh Strategy of the circular economy 2030, with the objective of moving from a linear economy to a circular economy — in which the lines of waste policies are defined in the most relevant sectors and all its inspiring principles have been added to this bill. Now we want to move ahead firmly in a modern and effective waste management. That\'s why we are faced with a very necessary law for our autonomous community, with which we advance the Central Government\'s approval of state legislation, which had to be already operational in July 2020 and which today has only one joint text. So we\'re closing, from Galicia, the circle of necessary tools and putting ourselves at the head of Europe in a circular economy. In short, this is a law that stands out for being more complete and technically appropriate to give real and necessary answers to the activity in Galicia. We simplify the administrative burden, which is fundamental, we improve control but also manage administrative procedures and bet on green employment. One of the guiding principles of the law is hierarchy in waste management, and it focuses especially on the first step, which is fundamental: the prevention of these wastes. The law does not only make European and national objectives its own, but in some cases, such as the reduction of waste we produce, we advance ourselves in five years — from 2030 to 2025 — with a view to reducing them by 15% on the data we have of the year 2010. In addition, in Galicia we mark ourselves as a target to achieve in 2021 that more than 50% of textile waste, as well as electrical appliances and furniture, are introduced into the repair chain for reuse — a percentage that will be 55% for the year 2025 and 60% for the year 2030. In this same line, the text also includes the establishment of centres specialized in the repair of waste reuse, especially waste from electrical, electronic, textile and furniture appliances. In fact, we\'ve already had some program, some pilot plan, like what we inaugurated in the year 2019 in Valga Town Hall. The new text envisages the progressive increase in the re-use or material recovery of non-hazardous wastes of construction as well as demolition, up to 75% in 2025 — compared to 70% proposed by the State. It also sets recycling targets by boosting the recycling of single-use packaging, with the goal of being able in the year 2025 to recycle up to 65% of these, and reaching 70% on the horizon of the year 2030. As regards the shipment of waste to landfills — as well as another European target — it states that only 10% of the waste generated to landfills can be shipped. That\'s what we call ""zero technical truth."" With regard to this point, I would like to remind you that since 2009 the German Government has put an end to the landfills and we are moving towards a proper management of our waste. We ended up with the dump model that meant depositing the garbage directly on the territory and without control and security measures. And in 2013 we closed the last unauthorized municipal dump existing in Galicia. Even so, since April 2009 we have eliminated more than a thousand points of uncontrolled dumping throughout Galicia. Between this year and last year, it was more than 200 of the spills that we eliminated. The future law also lays the groundwork for plants to reach this technical vertigo in 2035; that is to say, lead to the single and exclusively waste dump that we are not able to deal with on any of the pathways, a goal that Sogama is about to fulfill this same year. That means we\'re moving ahead with the European guidelines for fifteen years. I\'ll give you an example. The direct entry of waste into the Areosa landfill — which is Sogama’s — dropped from 209,000 tons in 2018 to 40,679 tons in 2019 —a transcendental step towards that goal. The future waste law has as one of its basic pillars collaboration, support and coordination with the municipalities, as it could not be otherwise. We recognize their potential, and we also know their problem. But, on the other hand, we are aware of their abilities so that we all engage in a common objective and therefore that the data we draw to public light are met everywhere. One of the main points of collaboration of the Union is the local authorities, which will continue to do, as is their obligation, the management of bioresidues, as municipalities must establish separate collection from the year 2023. They know that the articulated text of the Central Government here makes a separation between municipalities of less than 5,000 inhabitants and more than 5,000 inhabitants, so that the municipalities of more than 5,000 inhabitants begin their management from the year 2021. Galicia opts for all the municipalities, both of the least and of the most inhabitants, to make this collection separate from the year 2023. We are aware of this goal, so in the budgets of the year 2021 we reserve a total of 25 million euros for the construction of three bioresidue plants. The first will be in Vilanova de Arousa and will serve a total of 25 municipalities. It is, of course, added to the opening during this year established in the municipality of Cerceda. In fact, last week we auctioned the project of Vilanova de Arousa. It\'s a basic project. It will be a pioneering and modern plant in the use of efficient technologies, and it will facilitate the creation of 30 jobs, between direct and indirect. With regard to the municipal area, it should be recalled that the municipalities should also implement the collection of textile and hazardous waste from domestic origin one year later — before December 31, 2024 —. Another of the basic objectives of this text is to drastically reduce the consumption of plastics from one use. Human action is plasticizing the planet, particularly the marine environment, so we have to get the life of plastics to circulate. That\'s why the law prohibits the free delivery of plastic bags and the sale of single-use plastic vases. And they do it for two main reasons: they are products that demand a lot of energy for an excessively short useful period and, when they come into contact with the ecosystem -- in the seas, for example -- they produce damage and consequences that are devastating. We must remember that 80% of marine waste comes from the land and that one of the most abundant waste in the seas is plastic. That\'s why we must fight to avoid the plasticization of the planet and, above all, the plasticification of our seas. Braking food waste is another of the evasive measures that the German Government wants to respond to the entry into force of this new normative text. In this sense, I would like to remind you that about a third of the world\'s foods are lost or wasted, which amounts to 1,300 million tons a year. We must reduce food loss, not only for food, but also for saving on resources, both those needed to produce them and those needed to manage them later as waste. Besides, as citizens we must be more responsible for our buying habits. To be more attentive to what we should discard or to what we should take advantage of, as 42% of food waste is generated in our homes. To achieve this food waste reduction target, the law states that in 2025 we have to reduce by 30% the amount of food waste that we generate over the year 2010, a percentage that takes 50% five years later, in the year 2030. In order to achieve this, catering holders will be obliged to deliver, if the customer so requests, the spare portions of food not consumed on their own premises. And they should do it in compostable containers at 50%, with biodegradable material, never in single-use plastic materials. In addition, we will promote a code of good practice in relation to food surpluses; that is, a social pact, involving all the agents involved in the Horeca channel, to mitigate the production of food waste. So, and for all this, a lot of training and a lot of environmental education is needed, because in this way we will enable the consumption of raw materials and products to take place from an increasingly responsible perspective. In fact, this law bets on pushing younger people to act as catalysts for a better future. It\'s going to be their future, what belongs to them, but also what they deserve. Finally, the text also makes a special bet on a sustainable and environmentally friendly administration. For this purpose, it includes numerous measures, including the use of renewable energy in the administration and the impulse of the so-called \'green public contract\'. But this law not only deals with waste and its management, it focuses on the prevention of contaminated soils. It is established that soils must retain their natural functions at its maximum level, and recover using the best available techniques and always prioritising on-site recovery treatments. What we want is to promote better recognition and control of the quality of our soils. To achieve this, the creation of a complete inventory of soils will be established through the Sun Quality Register. This is complemented by a sanctioning regime that defines new sanctions for contaminated soils, with a maximum amount that can reach 1.7 million euros in the case of very serious sanctions. Finally, we are faced with an essential law for Galicia that will allow us to continue working towards a more sustainable future. It is a text with which Galicia advances to state legislation, which currently simply consists of an articulated text which has not yet obtained the visa and pleasure, or the green light, of the Council of Ministers to be referred to Congress. Suppose a bet determined by the transformation of Galician society into a committed model of different production and consumption, and that seeks to achieve a resilient Galicia that works to reduce climate change...', ""The Honorable President of HS Mr Jandrokovic, the Honorable Parliamentary MPs and MPs. First of all, it is my pleasure to present to you today the proposal for a waste management law. The legislative proposal is definitely the most complex legal act the ministry has had the opportunity to pass over the past few years. With the number of remarks, the intensity of the debates that are being conducted by certain components of waste management really deserves and be subject to a constructive debate before HS today. Let me introduce you to the bill itself. Therefore, the key role of the circular economy in achieving an ambitious objective of turning Europe into a climate-based neutral continent in 2050. As well as reducing pollution and halting biodiversity loss, the reasons are, in fact, the basis for this bill of law that is before you today. The exploitation of natural raw materials has increased over the last 50 years, the exploitation of natural resources and the processing of materials, fuel and food leads to approximately half of total greenhouse gas emissions and causes more than 90% loss of biodiversity. In Croatia, but throughout Europe, we are still too linear and dependent on the natural resources that are processed into products and are finally being put off as waste. Only 12% of the materials used in industry are recycled in the EU. The European Green Plan and the new Circular Economy Action Plan represent the framework plans for key European policies and measures in the area of climate and the environment, whose implementation and the task of this generation are and for which a strong synergy of sectoral policies is needed. The strategy of low-carbon development of the Republic of Croatia, the new regulations in the area of climate documents, are which direct our transition towards a climate neutral and resolutely efficient society. This is why the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development is going with such an ambitious at some point a very ambitious waste management law. The new Waste Management Act, which we present today, is part of the objective of the European Green Plan, and the priority is to reduce and recover materials in recycling. The implementation of this law is closely linked to legislative proposals and policy initiatives for sustainable products and new regulatory frameworks for batteries, waste vehicles, the reduction of excessive packaging waste and others. What follows is a very intense period in this area and changes that will affect each of us, and all with the aim of reducing the amount of waste that is produced, we recover it, we recycle it, and we reduce the delay to the least possible extent. Sustainable product policy, fostering circular product design through the reduction and re-recovery priorities introduces a business model that will prevent harmful environmental impact on the product and strengthen the extended responsibility of the manufacturer. This sustainable product policy significantly reduces the amount of waste. However, when waste cannot be avoided, its economic value must be restored and its adverse impact on the environment and climate change minimised. Special emphasis is placed on strengthening the market for secondary raw materials and by-products, especially secondary raw materials with mandatory content of recycled materials. The adoption of the Waste Management Act is part of the harmonisation with the legal acquis of the EU, which has been amended in the field of waste management, as amended during 2018 and 2019. through the Waste Directive, packaging and packaging waste, waste dumps, waste vehicles, batteries, batteries, electrical and electronic equipment and reducing the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. The abovementioned amendments to the European legislation of 2018, which relate to waste, bring more and more demanding objectives which have been incorporated into this legislative proposal. By 2015, at least 55% of the mass of municipal waste must be recovered by recycling and preparation for recovery. By the same year, at least 65% of the total waste packaging must be recycled. By 2030, five bottles should contain at least 30% recycled plastic. By 2035, a maximum of 10% of total production of municipal waste from 2025 should be postponed at landfills of waste. Until 2035. At least 65% of the mass of municipal waste must be recovered by recycling and preparation for recovery. Plastics or single plastic products are our everyday life because of their high functionality and relatively low cost. Although plastics play a useful role in the economy and key changes in many sectors due to its growing use and in short-life products that are not designed for reuse or cost-effective recycling of production and consumption patterns associated with it are becoming increasingly inefficient or.../incomprehensible/..., therefore, in the context of the action plan for the circular economy of the European plastic strategy in the circular economy, the problem of the constant rise in plastic waste generation and the disposal of plastic waste in the environment, especially in the marine environment, must be resolved in order to achieve a circular life cycle of plastics. In the EU, between 80 and 85% of marine waste makes up plastics with plastics for single use making up 50% and items related to fishing for 27% of the total amount of waste in the sea. Plastics for single-use use include a whole range of commonly used consumer products that are rapidly spent and discarded once used, and for which they are intended, are rarely recycled and are often discarded into the environment as waste. Therefore, plastics for single use and fishing gears containing plastics are a particularly serious problem in the context of marine waste. They pose a serious threat to marine ecosystems, biodiversity and health and harm activities such as tourism, fisheries and maritime transport. In view of the fact that the part of plastics for single use is made available to an appropriate more sustainable or environmentally acceptable alternative to this proposal, the law prohibits the placing on the market of the following single plastic products. These are ear stickes, cutlery, plates, straws, potion mixers, balloon sticks and food containers, or containers and drink glasses made of expanded polythyren, including their stoppers and lids. Certain plastics for single use end in the environment due to inadequate disposal. These products often lack information on the essential characteristics of the product or the appropriate method of waste disposal. Therefore, such plastics for single use must be adequately and marked and the label shall contain information for consumers on appropriate options for waste management for the product or on which waste management methods for that product should be avoided and in accordance with the hierarchy. In the case of plastic products for single use for which no appropriate and sustainable alternatives are available, in accordance with the principle of pay pollutants. Programmes for the extended responsibility of manufacturers are introduced to cover the necessary costs by the management of these forms of waste and the cost of measures to raise awareness of all citizens and to prevent the creation of this waste. It is also necessary to mention the problem of environmental pollution by discarding plastic carrying bags, especially in water bodies, which threatens the aquatic ecosystems. Plastic bags for wearing with a wall thickness of less than 50 microns, etc. lightweight plastic carrying bags, which make up a large majority of the total number of wearable plastic bags, are rarely used again than thicker plastic carrying bags. These lightweight plastic bags are therefore rapidly becoming waste and are more often polluted by waste because of their small weight. The current recycling rates of lightweight plastic bags are very low and therefore a number of practical economic difficulties in the near future are unlikely to reach a more significant level of recycling itself. In order to reduce the consumption of light plastic carrier bags, they should lead to a sustainable reduction in the consumption of light plastic bags and must not cause a total increase in the production packaging and may include restrictions on placing on the market such as a ban. Although an obligation was introduced in the Republic of 2019 to collect lightweight plastic carrying bags at the point of sale of goods or products of their consumption is not sufficiently reduced. Data indicate n total growth in the consumption of plastic bags to carry in the Republic of Croatia in 2019 compared to 2018. Although the fall was recorded in the category of light plastic carrying bags, there was a total increase in the consumption of plastic bags, which is not in line with the target. Therefore, by prohibiting the placing on the market of light plastic carrier bags, it wants to encourage the use of thicker plastic bags and to prevent waste and recovery. In addition to the measures that have led to the public's greatest interest, the law regulates other waste management issues and introduces, instead of a waste management permit, the entry into the register of the competent county office, which simplifies and speeds up the process of passing the necessary documents for waste management, such as biological recovery, energy recovery of hazardous waste, waste oil recovery for the production of biofuels, etc. Furthermore, this legislative proposal lays down the responsibilities for keeping records and eyewitnesses for waste management activities according to which the county offices or the City of Zagreb are run by an eyewitness of the collectors and repairers, an eyewitness of the by-product, carrier records, trader intermediaries and recycling yards and re-use centre records. And the ministry is leading an eyewitness to the removal of waste status. This law also provides for a public service for the collection of mixed municipal waste. As is known, during the drafting of this draft law in March 2021. The Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia has reached a decision and related to a request for a number of parties to assess the consent of the Community waste management Regulation and the Law on Sustainable Waste Management with the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, and the proposal for a law that is now fully in line with the Constitutional Court's decision before you today. Furthermore, the proposed law introduces new provisions in re-use centres, which has not been regulated so far. The process of managing the Eyewitness on production and flow shall be simplified, or the competences and conditions for the management of waste from the mining industry shall be attributed. It is prescribed that bonds made by the RH Waste Management Plan are the Republic of Zagreb, or the City of Zagreb, which is a change from the current commitment made by JLS. Regional approach to the planning of one of the most important recommendations sent by the European Commission to the Republic of Croatia in its 2018 report on the implementation of European waste legislation. The same report also assessed the need to strengthen economic instruments in waste management, and this proposal sets out the obligations for manufacturers of products in the context of extended responsibility and the way in which the manufacturer’s extended responsibility system is organised through the Environment and Energy Efficiency Fund. Specific categories of waste for which specific conditions of management or payment of special fees are prescribed shall be determined. For the purpose of the transparency of the system, advice on the necessary categories of waste shall also be introduced in order to ensure that producers who pay fees and processors who process waste monitor and analyse measures in the systems of specific categories of waste and on the market of secondary raw materials. The economic instruments of waste management shall be prescribed, primarily incentivising compensation, waste disposal fees, fees due to the proximity of landfills and fees for the use of landfills, return fees and waste management fees under the extended responsibility of producers. The number of provisions relating to cross-border waste transport is reduced, the content and competence of the waste management information system is determined, inspection and administrative oversight of the application of the law is prescribed, and infringement provisions, transitional and final provisions. Finally, all of the above, in line with the direction that we seek in the future through integration of the circular economy and the waste management sector. The waste management system proposed by this law has been tasked with meeting very ambitious waste management targets until 2035, and I had previously had the opportunity to state. Prevention of waste and re-use is one of these objectives. Increase recycling and reduce waste disposal, promote innovative solutions for products and materials, raise public awareness of the importance of waste prevention and reuse of material or objects, and restore the economic value of waste that cannot be avoided. Dear Parliamentarians and MPs, given the importance of this topic for all our citizens and citizens, for units of local and regional self-government, finally for the entire Republic of Croatia, I am sure that today's debate, which will be conducted in accordance with certain articles of this law, will go primarily in the direction that this proposal of the Waste Management Act allows all of us, at the level of the Government of the Republic of Croatia, the Environment and Energy Efficiency Fund, counties and cities and municipalities, to further improve, in the coming period, the waste management system in the Republic of Croatia, all with the aim of protecting the environment and biodiversity in the Republic of Croatia, increasing the re-use of recycling, re-use of materials, so all with their own objectives that carry environmental and environmental protection of the Republic of Croatia. Thank you very much for your attention.""]","<|system|>

Mr. President, dear lawmakers, I salute you, our High Council, and our fellow saints on the screens. I have made a pledge on behalf of my group on the motion to set up a parliamentary research commission on climate change and natural water resources. Yes, precious Regents, our rate of use of natural resources is increasing exponentially every year. This also exceeds the capacity for self-renewal resources, thus destabilizing the natural balance. Water is one of the most indispensable sources for almost every living thing affected by this frame. According to World Bank data, the total use of water on a global basis at the beginning of the 20th century was around 670 billion cubic metres, while it has now increased by about 6 times more than 4 trillion cubic metres. According to the United Nations World Water Development 2020 Report, water use increases by 1 per cent each year. Thus, in 2050, today's use rate is expected to increase by more than 30 per cent. This will undoubtedly raise pressure on water supply, along with the growing population. Water is the lifeblood, the spring of life that all creatures must have. It's a miraculous liquid given by the Creator that life without him can't be imagined. It's not just a nutrient, it's basically an important element in agriculture, industry, energy production. As a glass of water cools us in warm weather, so with the evaporation of a trillion tons a day, it's a unique blessing that sees an air conditioner that cools our world. On average, a water molecule spends 98 years of its cycle in the oceans, 20 years in the glaciers, two weeks in lakes and rivers, according to the U.S. Geological Research Administration. However, with the climate crisis, the biggest global problem of our day, changes in the rain regimes also brought the water problem to light. Water isn't just the problem of the developing world, it's basically everyone's problem. See, one of the nine people in the world -- that's about a billion people -- can't reach safe water, no water in their homes. In 2025, half the world's population is expected to experience water stress. We have a water problem in our country. The amount of water per person is 1,500 cubic meters. This value shows that our country is in a category of water shortages. In 2023, the amount of water per person is estimated to drop to 1,300 cubic metres year-on-year, and in 2030 year-on-year to 1,100 cubic meters. Because if the amount of water per person falls below a thousand cubic metres, the country faces this risk. According to State Water Affairs data, our country's total water reserves are around 112 billion cubic metres, but we can only evaluate half of it, about 57 billion cubic metres of it in the available areas. We use three-quarters of this water in agriculture, half of the remaining water in industry, and the other half in domestic use. That's not the case in developed countries. In developed countries such as North America and Europe, the water rate used in agriculture is around 40% of the largest dehydration. In addition, our country is located in one of the most affected areas of climate change, the Mediterranean basin. This imbalance in the rains, seen due to climate change, will also cause damage to the rich biodiversity in wetlands, which are protected by international contracts such as the water fields and Ramsar, which are home to many species of life. Our greatest hope is that the drought will only be limited as a meteorological drought, or, in other words, as a decline in rain; otherwise, if it lasts more than a year, it will cause hydrologic droughts, reductions in subterranean and above-ground waters, which we need rain on the normals for at least a few years to compensate. Some maps shared by NASA on January 11th noted declines in soil humidity and subterranean water levels in our country, and the risk of drought was highlighted by NASA. At this time of winter, the weather is watching over the seasonal norms, making the citizen think of snow, as drought alone is not a problem, but other problems, including agriculture and food -- it is clear that it will cause difficult problems in areas such as health, economics -- to make amends. So, what should we do? Dear Regents, the world is now a whole, a problem that is happening in one place, and soon it affects another, an unpleasant example of the epidemic that we're still living in, and it's just beginning at one point. In the same way, problems in water, air and climate are now a global influence, and it is necessary to act jointly at the point of combating that reputation. One of the 2030 Sustainable Development Purposes set by the United Nations in 2015 is access to water, which is the most fundamental right for all humans. The goal of clean water and sanguation, which is the sixth place of 17 purposes, is directly based on this issue. Thus, governments, regional governments, local governments, even individuals have a responsibility. In this respect, water accounting and monitoring work, including many parameters, including both national and local water resources, current conditions, usage and proportions, should first be considered. A separate and holistic water law is one of the works we need. Another issue that should not be ignored is the gathering of water-related governments under one roof in order to prevent multi-headedness in water management. The assessment of alternative water sources is one of the key applications. At this point, the rainwater harvest is a very appropriate step in making it necessary for the Ministry of Environment and Urbanism, with legislation on January 23rd, to build the structures that have more than 2,000 square metres of land. I have every confidence that this step, which protects our natural water supply, will be enforced by municipalities for small parcels. Yes, dear Regents, I repeat: we have great responsibilities for the Regents, and most importantly, we need to change our consumption habits. The water footprint tends to be one of those things. In the case that we prefer to supply 1 gram of protein that our body needs from veal, our water footprint is 112 litres, and when we get it from an egg, our water footprint goes down to 29 litres by four times, even if we choose to get this 1 gram of protein from the bacterium, our water footprint is only 19 litres. This will protect our water supply and contribute greatly to the fight against climate change. Yes, Councilmen, let's leave a mark on life, a mark that will not be forgotten; a big one, but please, let the water tread be small, I salute our coven."", 'Thank you, Madam President. Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. ""Residual water and its reuse"", this is the motto chosen by the United Nations Assembly for the celebration of Water Day, March 22, 2017. We very often forget that we belong to a country, Spain, developed, without serious problems of drinking water supply, with a high level of purification. What happens every day in our homes, having quality drinking water supply, is a great social achievement. A social achievement that does not reach 630 million people, who do not have quality drinking water. In addition, we have systems for sanitation, waste water collection and treatment; systems that do not reach 2.4 billion people. Climate change, its effects and cuts in cooperation funds have not helped to improve the global situation. The reuse of clean water has been taking place for several decades. It is in Royal Decree 849/86 that a major legislative change takes place, which requires the adaptation of the articles of the regulation of the hydraulic public domain dedicated to the reuse of the purified waters, in accordance with the mandate of the General Health Act of the same year, Law 14/1986. All this in order to meet a general objective provided for in the above-mentioned Law, which is not other than that the competent water administrations must participate in this field through the monitoring, promotion and improvement of the systems that allow to reach parameters of water quality compatible with the health of the population. Other changes have occurred to this legislation, always with the aim of improving this practice and its management and extending the model to the rest of Europe, so that the management and reuse of clean water is included in the hydrological plans of the second cycle 2015-2021. And during 2016 the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment, together with the European Commission and Malta, worked in a group on water reuse to design strategies to increase the efficiency of the use of resources, in addition to the minimum quality requirements that will be required for these waters, with the aim of developing a European guide of good practices for the reuse of clean water. And why can we use these waters or what can we use these purified waters for, which is already regulated in some way? For residential urban use, irrigation of private gardens, discharge of sanitary equipment, for services, irrigation of urban green areas, cleaning of streets, washing of industrial cars, systems against fires, for agricultural use, pastures, aquaculture, irrigation, woody crops, nurseries, fodder... In Vitoria we have a very interesting example about this irrigation system with reused water from purification. But also for industrial use, for processing and cleaning water, for cooling towers, for recreational use, for irrigation of golf courses (this is also given in Spain at many points), for environmental use, for recharge of aquifers, for irrigation of forests (forestry), green areas, maintenance of wetlands or minimum flow rates, etc. Each person uses approximately 200 litres of water per day. Wastewater treatment and reuse is a way of addressing water scarcity, extending the water life cycle and preserving resources. Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritimes and Fisheries, said that for the circular economy the greatest potential lies in the reuse of treated municipal waters. This re-use can also be an economic opportunity that European Union companies can take advantage of, helping to create jobs and opportunities and to avoid negative impacts on the environment. The European Commission is encouraging and further promoting the collection of municipal waste water for use in agriculture mainly and recharge of aquifers. This reuse of water and its destination for agriculture is an important benefit: the volume of hectares can be kept in water and this supply guaranteed in periods of drought, reducing the risk of bad harvests and loss of income due to lack of water. It also has a positive impact on the value of land. It gives value to drylands. In Álava, as I told you before, we have a very interesting example: the wastewater station and reused in Arrato. It was built by the Foral Diputación de Álava in 1994, with an investment of 400 million pesetas. It reuses 50% of what is purified in Crispijana, 30,000 cubic meters, which are dedicated to irrigation of approximately 4,500 hectares and which affects twenty-one villages of the City of Vitoria, and is an example that has also been recognized by Unesco. Therefore, there are models, and what is needed is that we continue to work in this area. For example, they told us from the Rioja Alavesa Water Consortium that it would be interesting to reuse, because they are concerned about the scarcity of water resources, the problems of supply in some areas; because it could be used for the moderate use of public gardens, also private gardens, for street cleaning, for the control of orchards... In short, I believe that the reuse of clean water is necessary to address it, and that is the purpose of presenting our initiative. Our group presented an initiative, the groups supporting the Government and Elkarrekin We have tabled amendments. We have reached a compromise amendment that we will vote in favour of the groups of the Government and the People\'s Group, and I believe the rest will abstain. But, in any case, this initiative seems to me to be a very positive position, because the reuse of clean water is necessary. Because there are those who, given the scarcity of water, propose to reduce the hectares of irrigation, to reduce industries that consume a lot of water, and that is to impoverish us. And what we have to achieve is to approach this in an integral way, and to use reuse as we are told from the European Union and the Member States. The compromise amendment we have reached reads as follows: ""The Basque Parliament urges the Basque Government, in coordination with the other bodies and institutions responsible for water management in the Basque Country, to promote and develop existing plans for the implementation of waste water reuse systems in the Basque Country, in accordance with the proposal of the European Union for the safe and efficient reuse of water, in particular by carrying out the necessary technical and economic feasibility studies of the reuse of water from certain EDARs, as well as, where appropriate, any incentive measures to users"". As I said, these measures are contained in the hydrological plans, but it is true that they must be put in a context of how we can apply it here. We are in 2017, these plans are 2021; therefore, what we say at this point is that we are developing these measures and that incentive measures are also activated, so that those systems that are in place are improved, that the issues that need to be changed are changed so that they are fully adapted to the European idea or to the guide of good practice that is being done from Europe, and that the water that they transform is of the best quality possible. In the second point we say that ""the Basque Parliament urges the Basque Government, in coordination with the bodies and institutions responsible for water management in the Basque Country, to establish a programme of subsidies for the study of technical-economic feasibility and the necessary improvements to adapt to the requirements of the European legislation on the matter for holders of waste water reuse systems operating in the Basque Country"". New, modern clean-up infrastructures are being developed, and it would be interesting if the feasibility of whether these clean-up waters could be reused would be studied. We agree that the viability plans should be made, that subsidies should be given to make these viability plans, but I believe that this is a timely time to enhance these re-use systems. There is a very singular fact that I have already said this more often in this House talking about water, but it is that the dry part of the Basque Country supplies water to the wet part. This is curious, singular, but that\'s what happens. This morning we heard the representative of the Bilbao Water Consortium, who, if it doesn\'t rain in a month, will have problems with the supply of drinking water. What\'s going on? We will have to think about what to do to ensure that these circumstances do not pass because in a period of five months there is no precipitation. And we don\'t have those systems today. A few years ago, when there was a drought, driving pipes were made to link water from other supply systems, but today these pipes have not been revised and are completely destroyed. If tomorrow there is a difficulty in giving drinking water to the entire population, we should do the pipe again, because the one we did in his day, which has not been maintained, is destroyed, because there has been no maintenance. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, the issue of water has to be taken very seriously. But very seriously. It\'s our base of operation! And, therefore, I think that, in addition to having the pipes in condition, we have to think that if we can take advantage of the purified water and reuse it, then it is our obligation to meet this need, because we have nothing left, and that we are in a privileged area. But we don\'t have a good distribution here. As I was telling you, the dry part of the Basque Country supplies water to the wet part. That said, I think it\'s to make us think that something we\'re not doing right. Nothing more. Thank you very much.', ""Thank you, Vice-President of the Croatian Parliament, distinguished ministers with associates here on behalf of the HSS Club and Democrats a few words about these three laws that are before us in the debate. First of all, I want to say on behalf of the HSS Club that I, and I believe you all believe that water is the right of every man and that this right to water should be constitutional law. If this is built in its constitution by neighbouring Slovenia, I think we should think about it and install in the constitution a right to water, that it should be a constitutional category. Also when it comes to water, it is said that water is a public good, our national wealth and it is really nice to hear and boast that we are one of the richest EU Member States with drinking water reserves. And what I want to point out with this is that if it's public good then there should be a stop or no privatisation of these national resources, not a privatization of water, and we are witnessing that concessions are being transferred these days to springs and also to state agricultural land to new companies from Agrokor in a group of new Fortenovo and so on. without one real analysis being made whether it is the interest of the Croatian people, of the Croatian state, of Croatian farmers, of Croatian inhabitants or of someone's private interest, and from this we see that it is not a public good, but through this it has become someone's private interest, which is certainly not good. When it comes to the Water Act, which should allow better control, monitoring, protection, availability of proper water, then it is certainly to be welcomed that after, I think, there have been 6 amendments to the law, there is finally one clean Water Act going on and thus a message is sent that we really want to have quality control, monitoring and availability of health proper water to all our citizens. But is it true? So the fact that it isn't, here are a few examples where we allow the wider regional waste dumps in Davor, Piškornica near the Koprivnica Wateryard, what about sanitary protection zones, to be properly determined and whether anyone controls them. There were several public advances, including me here from the pay phone, asking for inspections to come out and determine the situation, and unfortunately we didn't get feedback on whether there was anything wrong there, and God forbid there was some sort of elemental disaster earthquake and so on. So that there is pollution in this water supply and that 60,000 people are left without drinking water that is gravitating that water supply. Also, when it comes to accessibility, we are still with, it is nice to hear that somewhere 96% is the availability of drinking water to our fellow citizens, the possibility of a connection. However, we still have a large number of islands where there is no drinking water, we still have a series of small villages especially in rural areas where there is no availability of drinking water and we need to find ways and models to get drinking water too. These are huge investments that public water suppliers themselves will not be able to do, and therefore we need, that the EU money, but also through the part that the public water supplier has to co-finance and the projects will not be able to set up a solidarity fund on their own. There were talks about this especially when it comes to islands, the question is here we at HSS ask what about whether it will be, and we also ask it to be used to build water supplies in rural areas, small settlements where it is not worth it. I have already asked in the reply of the minister why, out of the billion and fifty million euros that has been allocated to these water supply and water supply projects, only 9.6% are realised, and this is not a good result, and it has to be changed and seen where these brakes, who are these brakes, are they themselves water-serving companies, public water suppliers or the public administration has failed. Because Minister Žalac herself said in one statement that she was not satisfied with how projects are being prepared in this ministry and in Croatian waters, and should certainly be changed urgently because we must withdraw these money, build water supply and water management. And here's an example that it's really been going too slow for two and more years is being negotiated for Project Ship 3 on the construction of water treatment and purification. Only today after 2 years is the meeting in the Croatian waters where the final technical solution is defined and only after that is adopted is the follow-up of the project and further preparation of public documentation for the call for tenders and withdrawal of money. And they rightly ask the citizens of the area from Nova Kapela to Vrpolj and Sikirevac when they will get the sewerage, when they will get the possibility of a connection and when they will have a purifier that the water supply is not polluted either in Sikirevci or in Slavonski Brod, or in Davor. I also want to highlight the problem that, here, we mention it in the law, and that is the problem of waste mud, the mud that comes from wastewater purifiers. We do not have it solved, how to take care of it, where to take care of it and on it must be done if we want to preserve the environment for generations to come, and one example of care for the inhabitants of rural areas and the protection of the water supply is the City of Chabar, where for several years they have been writing letters to the Primorje-Gorski County, the Ministry, Croatian waters to solve their problem, but they are still at the beginning, as soon as the heavy rain gets there, mixing drinking water and fecal water, it has not been healthy for months then, and no one has yet made a project, nor has it guaranteed these people when it will be solved, and when they will get drinking water, and when their water treatment or purifier is resolved, which is there, but clearly has not yet been quality built or is not sufficiently technical good enough. When it comes to the Water Service Act, when it comes to defining how much we really need water-sustaining areas, as much as public water-supervisors, I think it is not good, and that it is not enough, that it must be taken into account and that future public water supplier is able to use EU funds, as self-sustainable and what is ultimately the most important price of water is whether it will be accessible to citizens or their income. I'm afraid we haven't worked it out enough, at least we don't have that information, and it's not good for us from HSS that it's only determined by the Government Regulation that it will be 35 or 40, why it's hiding from the public, why not remain a public water supplier and the Vinkovci waterworks, and the Slavonski Brod and the Regional Waterway Davor-Nova Gradiška, and the Djakovo Voda, if they meet these more criteria, not just one criterion. I don't think that's sufficiently elaborated, that it's not publicly available enough, that it's not well or communicated to cities and municipalities, and that the evidence that goes past the public is not put into law or through public debate. And certainly, it should be pointed out that most of them have so far been lost by water suppliers in the network, some thirty, forty, some even 60%, and because we have over 190 suppliers, which have increased their numbers for years, increased their number of employees, increased their losses in business and increased the losses in the water network, and now we of those two or three bad, sick want to create one big patient. Especially in the context that they will now have to pay for the amount of water affected at the water supply site which they have not yet paid, but only for the quantity delivered. As it will then be affordable for citizens, whether the price of water will rise for citizens and the economy, because if gas prices, electricity rise these days, it will be a disaster to increase both water prices, both for citizens and for the economy. They mentioned some here that due to climate change, we are already having a drought problem, especially here in Eastern Slavonia already cannot be maintained, we are doing spring crops due to drought, and I mention that in the context of the fall of groundwater levels. And we need to find models and these laws need to create a tool to preserve the level of groundwater, so here I mention that a series of accumulations of retentions that have started designing, however they do care. They will also serve to protect against the harmful effects of water from streams of wells, but tomorrow they can be a high-quality water tank for raising and levels of groundwater, as well as for irrigation, because without irrigation there is obviously no food production in Croatia, because we certainly need to take care of it. There is also a big problem and a detailed channel network, some of the 24 thousand kilometers in Croatia, in Brod-Posavina it is over three thousand kilometers, Osijek-Baranja more than six, and a large part of that canal network is still uncleaned, unregulated, especially after, in those areas where there have been war activities, and certainly that Countys could not take it, although under the Law they are the owners, but they are never taken over, nor can they be taken over until it is fully in a state that it can be used, and that then they can also introduce compensations for Meliorition discharge, because which the County will introduce compensations for Melioration disposal if a large part of these canals are not arranged, cleaned and practically there are now shrubs and space to settle the bricks, wild pigs, instead of the production and production of food, and certainly that must remain in the production of Croatia's water and agriculture. And it should also be said that we haven't used enough of our rivers, especially when it comes to waterways, we still haven't solved the waterway on the Sava River to Slavonski Brod, still that sedated barrier which has long been promised that for about a million and a half, two million kunas will be solved, and not solved, so I ask you when it will be, I think that the City of Slavonski Brod and, then maybe even to Sisak if it is allowed, come and which cruisers and which tourists also to Slavonski Brod, and to Sisak. I think it must be solved, and I also find it strange why it is from some important projects for Croatia, I think it is important for Croatia, and for Slavonia the Danube-Sava channel. There was a lot of talk, we put it in some of our development papers, most of the county was Z, and now it's quiet. I think that we should put it back into important development projects, surely in this way preserve agricultural production, and forests in Slavonia, but also ensure cheap waterway and economic growth in Slavonia and Baranja, I hope that this is a common interest for all of us. And here, in the end, we should say that we are all interested in these laws really being a tool, that every citizen has available medically correct drinking water, that there is the possibility of a draining connection, to protect the environment and to prevent abuses and private interests if the water is public good, and that there must be public good and no water building can happen, river pollution or private interests in the use of water supply sites, but also water springs, we must take care to preserve these waters for generations to come but that it is economically and socially affordable to our citizens and certainly accessible. Thank you very much.""]","<|system|>

But for time winning, I refrain from acquiescence to them. Earlier today we have debated new asylum rules that the government wants to introduce, rules that violate both the right to asylum and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The flow of refugees that we see in the world today is a small breeze compared to the flow of refugees that we will see if climate change is allowed to continue. I think the Swedish Democrats should think about this. If there is any party that should be the biggest climate fighters, it is the Swedish Democrats. It gets a little tragic when you listen to Martin Kinnunen. If there is any party that is acting confidently without taking into account research and that plays on emotions, then I know exactly what party it is. It's Martin Kinnunen's own party. If there is anything on which our policy is based, it is research. If there is something we can see where Sweden is forerunner, it is precisely that we are able to reduce our emissions while increasing our growth. That is something for which we are given a great deal of praise internationally. Doomsday prophecies probably come from the Swedish Democrats themselves. This morning I came home from a trip to Chernobyl. It is a journey that cannot be described; it must be experienced for itself. Just as the people in Chernobyl's vicinity did not understand the extent of the effects after the accident – the enemy was actually invisible that time – probably not enough people understand the extent of the climate effects. Again, the enemy is invisible. I am very pleased that we have now, together, six parties in the Swedish Parliament, within the framework of the M iljömålsföreningen, also found out which Sweden's future climate goals should be. We are building on the climate and energy agreement entered into by the Alliance in 2009. In the space of two weeks we have had an energy settlement and a climate settlement that builds on this. Both as a signatory and as a center party, I am very proud to be involved in highlighting and sewing these broad agreements together. I would like to pay tribute to the parties involved in taking responsibility for these agreements. For us in the Center Party, it is self-evident to take responsibility. We may be a party of 70 per mille, but we are a party with great influence over politics. The Center Party is a party that always takes responsibility in difficult situations. The monitoring station that provides the framework for this debate is a follow-up to the agreement reached by the Alliance on climate and energy issues in 2009. It is also a clear value indicator of the year of the Alliance in power. The result is clear. We set the world's toughest climate targets in 2009, and we overdo them. We are already well above the targets we set for 2020, for example on the transport side. It is therefore also particularly gratifying that six parties have now agreed to raise the flag again and set tough climate targets. It also allows us to leave the unconstructive discussion about who has the highest goal, the lowest goal and the target formulations. We can leave that to climate populists and climate deniers, and then they can punch each other in the head and fight about it while the rest of us can go on and debate what makes a real difference, that is, instruments and how we can get the most effective climate benefit for the money. The world needs to change. The world is going to change. The only question is whether we want to be winners or losers in it. Winners will be those who see opportunities, which invest, which combine growth with reduced emissions, who understand that the future economy is circular and who are able to build their social structure. That is why it is so important that we in Sweden go ahead. Then our companies will switch. Then we can export. Then we can create climate benefits in other countries and deliver the solutions that provide jobs here and reduced emissions elsewhere when the rest of the world starts to understand and follow us. Just as Johan Hultberg said, it is not by setting tough goals that we go ahead. But it is by achieving the tough goals and making them more economic growth that other countries view with envy what we succeed with in Sweden. That is also why we have such a prominent position internationally. That is why the alliance government's climate policy was so appreciated. We see that the government is doing some good things. It would be dishonest to say otherwise. Although K Limatklivet can be discussed from an efficiency point of view, it has delivered quite a few charging poles. The Centre's requirement to remove VAT on small-scale electricity generation is now being implemented. The government continues its tradition of protecting small vulnerable countries in the climate negotiations. I think that's good. But we in the Center Party also differ significantly from the government. We're campaigning for green tax exchange. It is based on more taxes being collected from environmentally harmful activities while reducing taxes on things that are good and that we want more of, for example, work. It's a pretty simple principle. We see that this profile has been adopted by more parties in our alliance community. The Green Party has previously been quite a supporter of green tax exchange. But since it came into government, it has changed. Green tax exchange was the first to be a red tax increase in which it chose to increase taxes on labour. Now it has gone over to a type of grey – or perhaps even black – tax shock where one also chooses to increase taxes on what is renewable, what is good for the environment. I find that very hard to understand. You blame most of it. It blames the EU, the flows of refugees and the different methods of calculation. It is not an excuse that is considered too bad, and it is always someone else's fault. When investigations are set up, it seems that either the instructions have been misunderstood – they may have been substandard from the beginning – or the investigations are delayed. Bonus – Malus was first investigated with the investigation into the fossil independent vehicle fleet. But another study was set up, which came up with a proposal that primarily benefits diesel cars and had not even taken into account the climate challenge. I think you've missed something when you've written the directives. In autumn 2014, the government said that the obligation is to be introduced on 1 January 2016. It will now come sometime during its term of office. We'll see about that. It is also a kilometre tax that would break the forest industry completely. Looks like someone's got bad luck with how you think. I understand that you need a coordinating minister for that; that is no wonder. The only problem is it's going to be wrong. The Minister for Energy, who became the Minister for Coordination, now ends up with the Prime Minister's Committee. Climate issues end up at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The rest will be a butt-cut environmental department. I think thought is really good. But of all the decisions – both good and bad that the government has made – I think this is the most fatal mistake that has been made. Separating ministers who have commitment, drive and officials' knowledge of these issues leads to thinning them and smudging them all over the government. As a result, there will be less pressure to put hard pressure on negotiations with other ministers. Everyone will want money for their areas. I think we will see that in the future. We in the Center Party have many clear proposals for this change. We know how to make bonuses – the Malus proposal for a real environmental proposal where clean cars get bonuses and dirty cars pay. We know how to get a strategy for a bioeconomy. It's fun that the Environmental Objectives Committee is now lifting up precisely that kind of things and supporting our proposal. We thank you for that, and we hope, of course, that the government will pick it up. We want cars to be energy declared. We want to invest in renewable energy. We want a reduction obligation for biofuels in order to bring more of that into the market. We want to make it easier for the forest to become a real climate benefit. By tying the coal in the woods, we get real stuff in place. The list can be made as long as possible. But perhaps the most important thing is not that the Center Party has been the leading force in Swedish environmental policy in recent decades in terms of real environmental performance, but the most important thing is that we can now, thanks to the M iljömålsföreningen, actually lift our eyes, stop looking back and together continue forward. We agree on what to do and where to reach. Then we can start fighting about how to get there. I think that is much more constructive. Therefore, I hope that the government will pick up the proposals of the M illjömålsföreningen and ensure that they end up here in the Swedish Parliament."", ""Mr President, I would like to I would also like to thank Erik Ullenhag for his efforts in Swedish politics. I would also like to thank Magdalena Andersson for the way in which she thanked Mrs Ullenhag. I think it was in a real and positive way. During the years when Sweden's economic policy rested on the Alliance's budgets, Sweden went from being a country with empty barns to becoming a country that went like a Tesla. Unfortunately, neither society nor politics are so simple, so black or white. Sweden today has major challenges, and they will not be fewer or less in the future. We have a two-way labour market between people in town and country, between high and low-skilled, between young and elderly, between foreign and domestic born. We have an unemployment rate of over 50% among foreign born people in many places today. The government seems to be in a position to face this major challenge. We have a climate crisis that requires us to combine increased economic growth with less emissions. The growth of regions and municipalities is out of step with each other. All parts of our country are simply not given sufficient conditions to grow. But Sweden also has great opportunities. Throughout the country, ideas are transformed into small and growing companies that create jobs. Our climate emissions are falling while economic growth is increasing. Many of Sweden's dynamic locations are located outside the metropolitan areas, and it shows that with the right conditions, the whole of Sweden can grow. Sweden has great opportunities to become a winner in the economy of the future. However, this requires important reforms. The task of politics is to see the challenges and tackle them before the problems grow big. The Swedish economy faces two challenges in particular. Firstly, the number of jobs is not growing fast enough, despite the fact that we are now entering a boom. Secondly, the pressure on public expenditure is very high, not least because of inefficient labour market policies and growing sick leave rates. Despite the boom, the employment rate is expected to fall and unemployment to rise in 2017. Mr President, I would like to The Swedish job creation potential is found in small and growing companies. In my county of Jämtland, nine out of ten have had jobs created in these small companies for several years. Happily, that figure seems to be the one that will apply nationally. It shows the need to focus on these job-creating actors in policy making. In order to combat both division and exclusion, the Swedish labour market must be opened up to more people. It should be easier to start and build up the small company and it should be cheap to hire your first person. We from the Center Party propose that the employer's contribution for the first employee be removed. The service sector must continue to be expanded with an extended RUT deduction as a key component. That is how we achieve inclusive growth and that is how we get reforms to correct the two-way labour market. Mr President, I would like to No matter where you live – in the countryside, in smaller towns, in the suburbs or in the inner city – you should have the same opportunities to live, work and run businesses. Rural areas and cities share many challenges with each other. Equivalent opportunities throughout the country do not automatically imply uniformity. The same challenges can be solved in different ways in different parts of the country. The policy therefore needs to be designed with an understanding that the conditions are different in different parts of the country. Sweden is a global environmental standard. Under both the alliance government and previous governments, economic growth increased while our climate emissions decreased. The Swedish economy is one of the most climate-efficient economies in the world. Sweden has proven that economic growth can take place in parallel with less environmental impact and that the environment and economic growth thus go hand in hand. The Center Party wants to see a broad reform programme to reduce emissions and shift the vehicle fleet, reduce toxins in our daily lives and increase renewable energy production, which includes proposals to introduce vehicle fuel obligation schemes but also a bonus – the malus system for cars and heavier vehicles, improved conditions for large-scale and small-scale renewable energy production, and increased investment in both charging infrastructure and energy storage. Mr President, I would like to We need a fresh start with green tax exchange. It is a change that the current government has unfortunately left behind. Instead of increasing the tax on environmentally harmful activities and reducing it on jobs, you increase everything. The tax on jobs and entrepreneurship is increased six times more than the tax on environmental pollution. What the government is doing is not a green tax shift, but a real red tax increase. In government positions between 2006 and 2014, the Center Party contributed to a significant reduction in taxes on jobs and entrepreneurship. At the same time, environmental taxes were increased. But there is much more to be done. The tax on labour represents more than 1 100 billion of the tax burden in Sweden – the tax on pollution is just over 70 billion. This has increased drastically over the course of this year, with the budgetary policy and the budget that we now have to relate to. The government is running a negative green tax shift. And this seems to continue, Mr President. The previously criticised mileage tax on heavy goods transport has gone from a bad proposal to a completely lousy one. In the past, the government parties have had as a starting point that the penalty tax would be in the order of SEK 14 mil for truck transport. Last week it became known that the Government's Road Wear Tax Committee is now announcing a proposal that involves significantly higher expenses and costs: SEK 26 million. The proposal is a criminal tax at a distance that does not take account of environmental benefits and has major negative consequences for those living in rural areas and for Swedish industry, especially for forests as an important basic industry. My appeal to the government is clear: Dispose of the investigation's work in the trash! Put aside the idea of mileage tax! Mr President, I would like to The need for transparency and transparency in public finances cannot be stressed enough. Well-functioning, well-founded, relevant and easily accessible information is central to all policy areas. The Alliance government reported on the impact of policies in a number of areas, including employment. The importance of a good accounting of tax expenditure to the Riksdag has been highlighted in several reviews, including by the Swedish National Audit Office and the Council for Fiscal Policy. The fact that the government now chooses not to account for socio-economic effects is part of a pattern that raises criticism from an increasingly broad range. For the government, an analysis of tax changes should be crucial in order to allow for a priority between different expenditures. This is achieved only when a change in tax expenditure is followed by a broad and in-depth analysis based to the greatest extent possible on robust empirical evidence. Finally, Mr President, Sweden needs an economic policy that takes responsibility for the future. The Swedish economy has a great need for innovation. The Center Party does not shy away from that challenge. We know that responsible reforms in the coming years will ensure that Sweden will continue to belong to the world's richest, most innovative and safest countries for decades to come. Like Emil Källström, I would like to support the Center Party's budget motion. I would also like to support the joint reservation of the Centre Party and the Moderates in the Sku25 report on tax expenditure."", ""Mr President, I would like to Today we are faced with the completion of the facts. Man has already affected the climate on the planet, and the effects are seen daily. People are forced to move from drought. People are being forced away by floods. Starvation threatens in areas where food production is impossible due to increased temperature and less rain. This year we have experienced how all the months of the year, one by one, have been declared the warmest on the planet ever. It is clear that we in the world and in Sweden must plan and work for how we can manage jobs and well-being in a changing climate. In the climate letter that we are now debating, the government believes that adaptation measures should be taken early in order to avoid a higher cost in the future. It is about spatial planning, communications, economics, biodiversity and much more. Climate change will have a major impact on key functions in Swedish society as well. It is high time to take adaptation work seriously. The basis for the report we are discussing today is the government's letter on a monitoring station for climate policy. It states that Sweden will reach the climate and energy policy targets by 2020. What can we say again? Well, it went easier and better than we thought in 2009. It went easier and better, and we surpassed the goal once more, despite what the detractors thought in 2009. As a social democrat, I am convinced that we would have achieved higher ambitions. We've been saying that all along. Control posts are important, i.e. that the government monitors how Sweden manages to achieve the goals decided by the Riksdag. We Social Democrats have been putting forward proposals for years that this is something that needs to be developed, not just come from time to time with irregularities. The Parliament needs annual reports on emissions, and you need to regularly see a plan from the government on how the targets are to be achieved. They are part of what we call the climate policy framework. I believe that things such as accounting, monitoring and measurement are the basis for a good and credible climate policy. A proposal for a climate policy framework, negotiated by seven parties, is now on the government table from the Parliamentary Environmental Goals Committee. The proposal includes a climate law, a precise updated long-term climate target, climate action plans and a Climate Policy Council. To this is now added from the preparation of a final report containing proposals for the emission path and targets for 2030 and 2040, sectoral targets for the transport sector and further proposals and measures for a long-term climate policy. Here, too, a broad cross-block agreement was reached in which six of the seven parties held the final result together. It's important for delivery. Now the government can present proposals for decisions in the Riksdag, despite a challenging parliamentary situation. It will become a reality. It is a stable block agreement for ambitious climate work that carries jobs and prosperity for delivery. It is good and important for Sweden because it, as well as the energy settlement, is crucial for the jobs in Sweden and our common environment. It is by clarifying a long-term focus on climate and energy policy that we can lay the foundation for Sweden to become the first fossil-free welfare country. Without clarity and a long-term perspective, the investment will not come. This is what is needed to realise the many climate innovations that exist in the country. This calls for long-term security for investors. The government recently announced a major investment in green environmental and climate technology by developing and making available test beds in the field of environmental technology, such as cutting-edge technology for sustainable urban development. That's much-needed news. At the same time, new innovations are also needed for tomorrow's solutions. It is therefore gratifying that the Government has identified the climate and the environment as one of the most important areas in which the Innovation Council will invest. Sweden has a prime minister who puts technology development and new industrialization high. It is a policy that, in addition to leading to sustainable growth, will lead to reduced climate emissions and an opportunity for Sweden to achieve the goals that have been set. While we are developing the new environmental technologies that the world is asking for, we are reducing unemployment. It bodes well. The government also stimulates direct investments in the local government's climate work. The climate impact will receive SEK 600 million annually between 2016 and 2018 in part-financing for local climate action. We also invest in farmers' opportunities to reduce their climate impact and contribute to reduced imports of fossil fuels with the help of methane gas reduction aid. Investments and instruments, such as political determination, are the basis for an effective climate policy. Mr President, I would like to The driving forces that an offensive climate policy has for technological development, innovation and exports are also the reason why the review now makes it clear that the Parliament's objective to reduce emissions by 40 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990 is to be largely done at home. This is new news, and it is the announcement of high ambitions – higher ambitions than the previous bourgeois government had. It is entirely within the Parliament's decision. The bourgeois government estimated that one third of the reduction would take place by including emission reductions in other countries in its own Swedish emission reduction target. That assessment can be made. The current government can make and makes a different assessment. The bourgeois parties are very keen that Sweden should have the opportunity to meet some of Sweden's commitments to targets and emission reductions by taking measures in other countries – i.e. emission reductions in other countries that will be counted off on Sweden's commitment. I don't think it's very good. It is also symptomatic that, in this debate, this is exactly what the bourgeois parties collectively collect in their reservations in this report. It fights with beaks and claws to continue to meet domestic emission reduction targets by investing in other countries. Let me give you an illustration to understand what I mean and why I think it is bad. You're assigned to clean a room. Let's say there's 12 hecto dust in the room. Quickly we can see that the open floor area in the room is relatively fast to clean. Then you get rid of six hecto dust, but six remains under the couch, in the corners and so on. Then the question is whether you can clean the neighbor's room for payment instead. The neighbor says yes, and you clean the neighbor's open surface. You've got 12 hectos together. The problem is, it's still dirty in your room. Sooner or later, you're gonna have to take that shit away too. This is the case in Sweden of the Moderates, Liberals, Christian Democrats and Centers. When they have paid for climate action in other countries, the dirty corners remain in Sweden. It will require us to finally clean these corners, too, because all emissions will be removed in order to meet the international climate targets and live up to the UN climate convention. We can't get away from homework. The current government believes that it is smarter to have as a basic principle that we should meet our own emission commitments with our own emission reductions, that we can raise our ambitions. This is because it is needed but also to support technology development in Sweden, to increase the driving forces to develop new technologies, to create jobs here at home and to export the solutions to the climate issue that the world needs. Sweden needs more jobs. That is why the government has declared a new focus on politics. It is a policy that increases ambition, drives and finances international climate action more than ever and has decided to contribute further to the world's climate transition by taking responsibility for our own emissions reductions at home. In this context, I can take the opportunity to release an appetizer for upcoming election movements. A climate-ambitious government will be required even after the 2018 elections if we are to meet the 2020 target with higher ambitions. The same applies to maintaining high ambitions in a long-term climate and energy policy. Mr President, I would like to Let me conclude by stating that there are a lot of motions and reservations in this report. For those who are not so detailed in Swedish politics, there may seem to be a great disagreement in politics. But that's not true. The focus and the long-term goal that all emissions must eventually be removed are widely agreed in the Swedish Parliament. There is a broad commitment to an effective climate policy in the Swedish parliament. That is something we should be proud of. However, there are different approaches to the design of climate action, the pace at which it should be deployed and who should pay. The major exception in the Swedish parliament is the Swedish Democrats. They don't want to do anything, absolutely no more than we have to. In plain language, the party wants us to ignore Parliament's decision on climate targets by 2020 and the UN climate convention that Sweden has ratified and which was laid down in 1992. It states that it is the industrialised countries that should take the lead, which should reduce their emissions most and first. But the Swedish Democrats do as they usually do. They have their own introvert interpretation and do not think that Sweden should do anything. Instead, others will do more. They do not believe in reducing emissions in Sweden and argue that Sweden has so little emissions that it does not matter in general. What if everyone thought that way? Where would that take us? For us Social Democrats, the focus of climate policy is simple: fossil emissions must be reduced in order to end completely in the long term. It is about solidarity and justice. It's about survival. It's about making up your mind. We have decided, and the government has clearly declared this direction. Sweden should be involved in leading the development of active climate work, not stand aside. The Government wants Sweden to be a driving force for national and international climate work – an ambitious climate work that carries jobs and welfare. With this, I call for the proposal in the report to be approved.""]","<|system|>

The Honorable Chairman, the Honorable Minister, guests from the Ministry, colleagues and fellow Members of the People\'s Parliament, the forests belong to the largest and most complex land ecosystems on earth, and the importance of the forest community for the life and survival of our planet is contained in the most commonly used definition that the forests are the lungs of the planet. That\'s true. Forests are responsible for the fact that life on planet Earth still exists. This importance of forest ecosystems, as I am ecological, is recognised by Serbia from an economic and sociological aspect both through legal frameworks and through concrete measures. Ten days ago, we adopted the National Parks Act and further protected the forests and other flora and fauna in these specially protected areas. Today we are talking about once again for the protection of forests with a very important legal framework, and these are amendments to the Law on Forests, which is the legal basis for the protection and management of forests. The current forest law was passed ten years ago. A number of shortcomings have been seen in its application so far, that further improvement in forest protection and further development of the forestry sector was necessary to make changes to this law. The draft law amending and supplementing the Law on Forests covered a number of aspects of the legal protection of our forests, which represent well of general interest and a general useful natural well-being. The subject itself can be talked about with several aspects, because the proposed changes and additions start with the termological changes, the definition of new concepts, the precision and simplification of certain procedures, and the identification of essential elements in the ecological sense. The law improves the framework for nature conservation through monitoring the development of forests, their protection, the way of cutting, which, unfortunately, has been very often uncontrollable. Now the law foresees more rigorous control and cutting and transporting wood, by shortening the procedural life of a tree and taking care of it from planting to self-using, whether in the form of heat or wood processing. Marking shall be introduced by means of a valid stamp and the recording of the logging trees for which the escort is issued, as well as the applicable competences, as well as the return of the competence of the forest inspection over the control of the traffic of wood and the tightening of the criminal policy. Therefore, in order to reduce the scope of the illegal cutting, the law reintroduces the obligation of the documentation accompanying the goods in transport, which was abolished by the Law on the Forests in 2010, and, apparently, has had a bad effect in terms of removing the monitoring mechanism of the origin of wood in transport. This measure aims to reduce the illegal deforestation of forests as a protection of natural resources in the interests of the community because of its general useful functions. In particular, I consider the amendments to these provisions that created the problem or made practical application impossible, such as the definition of the forest. Now the forest has been defined as an area surrounded by forest trees with a minimum surface of five acres with a minimum land coverage of 30% crown trees. In this way, it expands and precisely defines the minimum surface area that can bear the name of the forest. This achieves a valid coverage of areas that can be considered forests and enables them to be more fully protected. The state plans a serious attitude towards forest protection confirms new provisions concerning the annual forest management plan, the medium-term forest protection plan. According to some estimates, the world disappears between 13 million and 16 million hectares of forest annually, and in Serbia, as many as 12,000 cc\'s of wood are illegally cut annually. I believe that the proposed legal solutions will affect better forest use control. This law provides for a system of uniform forest management by the Republic, then a unique system of forest planning and management, protecting and improving the environment and protecting the promotion of the plant and animal world, harmonising different needs and functions in the same space. This legal provision arises from the Constitutional Court\'s decision to move, with separate protection, into a controlled united, equal for all under the same treatment and uniform procedures under the control of the Ministry and the public undertaking ""Serbishum"". This public company is under a legal obligation to bring its work into line within six months with the provisions of the Law on Public Enterprises. In a series of significant changes and additions to the Law on Forests, it is also that several dozen hectares of forest will be solved which, after the entry into force of the Public Property Act, remain in state property without users and adequate protection. It is proposed that the user determines the Government on a proposal from the Ministry, and that the rights to use the protection and protection of forests shall be governed by the legal person referred to in Article 70. The forest law that the Ministry has decreed. In particular, I would refer to part of the proposed changes and additions relating to the protection of forests which are exposed to various forms of devastation from illegal cutting to various forms of biological and abiotic factors. These amendments and additions to the law correct this gap in terms of precisely planned changes and taking measures to protect forests and forest land. No matter who owns the forest, given their importance as well as the general interest, the interest of the state is to protect all forests, improves in accordance with the rules of the profession in professional and advisory support. These professional bodies can build fire protection plans in the forests of the owners of the natural person, monitor the effects of biological and abiotic factors on the health status of the forest. The report is one of the ways in which forest health is monitored, and whose user is obliged to deliver it to the competent authority by 15 January of the current year for the previous one in the event of a major threat without delay. According to a new legal solution, the ministry will trust the scientific and research area in the area of forestry in accordance with the regulations governing the health of plants, in the protection of forests from plant diseases and pests. In this way all measures will be taken with respect to the profession and science. Unlike the regular monitoring of forest conditions where a response and recovery can be made in time, significant biological balance and damage to forest eco-systems can result from natural disasters. In the past year, to remind, large floods and a large number of slides on forest land and ice-breaking land during last winter in forests and Serbia\'s forest eco system have caused huge damage, whether state or private. In eastern Serbia alone, about a million and a half metres of cubic trees were partially damaged or destroyed on an area of 40,000 hectares that required an emergency response to resuscitate these damages. Unfortunately, while looking at the damages, it has been observed that the existing legal solution is not adequate and that budgets cannot be allocated for the resolution of such forest damages. This perceived problem in the field with new legal solutions is being corrected. On the other hand, such situations are foreseen to eliminate the payment of forest charges for users and owners as well as where the area on which the recovery is carried out in accordance with the recovery plan, when it is necessary to cut and extract a damaged tree to prevent the spread of plant diseases and pests. So far, although damaged by elemental accidents, the owners for the urchin to extract damaged trees had to pay 5% of the tree\'s market value as a compensation for that cut tree. Many owners did not even make demands, since they had no profit from it. The proposed solution therefore constitutes a positive step in this case for owners and users to be exempt from the obligations of this fee. A new provision is also proposed when it comes to Chetinarians used for New Year\'s and Other Holidays, as due to irregular cutting of peaks and springs in forests, high pressure is being put on the four-year forests and their destruction. It is prescribed that trees can be used for this purpose from the cleaning and purification that certainly remove forests, as well as the planted tree in the nursery or below the power lines where it is otherwise impossible to cultivate forests, if they can be used with the bus and later planted, i.e. Returned nature, and these trees in transport must have an emissary and be stamped. Another good legal solution is the obligation of forest users to bring a plan to protect the forest from fire for a period of 10 years. Unlike natural disasters that cannot be controlled, fires can be prevented. The programme for the development of forestry in the territory of the Republic of Serbia is seen integratedly and brought by the government as a strategic document for a period of 10 years. I would take the opportunity to draw attention as someone coming from Vojvodina to the state of the forest in Vojvodina that has already been mentioned and where the percentage of the noise is only 7% and is projected at 14% by 2016. Without noise, land devastation is due to the fact that the planning of shale has multiple effects, as it will prevent soil erosion and increase yields, and in addition to increasing forest treasure, it will improve health and environmental conditions of life. It is far more important to focus attention on creating windy and agricultural belts, for which we simply cry out. These belts should be created along the road corridors, canals and roads of low importance, where there is quite enough room for planting. In doing so, it is important to make sure that no old mistakes are made, and that only local species must be used for planting. The role of the field of seat belts is to prevent the removal of layers of land from the field as well as to create a microclimate as much as we already have major problems here with strengthening extreme climate conditions. In the zone of these belts, the surface would enjoy a better micro-climate image. Oak Lužnjak, Step oak, Močvarni clear, lipa, these are the species for which planting should be pawned. The problem is that the decomposing producers turn to other species, usually exotic ones, while others are directed at decorative species. It is known that every year, with the Duke\'s hurricanes, it disappears 2.5 cm away from a wind-bending country and that Vojvodina\'s region with the smallest degree of deforestation in Europe, as I have already mentioned, is only 7% of its surface. Unfortunately, by shaming the Duke so far, it has been symbolic. That is why I would especially like to encourage and support new legislative solutions towards which, in line with the development programme, the budget of the Republic of Serbia, the autonomous province and local self-government will also provide funds for these protection belts through the steps of raising the degree of noise, improving the state of forest plantings and developing development plans in forestry. In general, these amendments to the Forest Act should contribute to a more comprehensive and efficient protection of forest ecosystems that are a huge natural resource, but it is an important economic potential. Wood is an industrial raw material and a source of significant income for both the economy and the state. Therefore, the control of the use of wood, on the one hand, and the sustainable development of forests and forest ecosystems, on the other hand, is a serious and lasting task. As this law implements the policies of the Government of the Republic of Serbia and provides for more functional, more efficient and rational forest management in the Republic of Serbia, we Socialists in the day of voting will support this Law. Thank you.', 'I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I welcome you. I also welcome the Secretary of State, Mr. Krajnick, Assistant Minister Francetic, all colleagues and colleagues. We have before us a proposal for the Law on Forests, we have already had the opportunity to hear a lot of debates, one part of these discussions is not directly related to the Law on Forests, but that is how it is discussed in this Croatian Assembly and ultimately it is not bad to open some topics that do not concern the very direct law. I would talk about the law first of all, on the constitutional basis for the adoption of this law, as stated at the very beginning of those opening provisions, that is the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia Article 2(2), which states ""the Croatian Parliament or the people directly, acting independently in accordance with the Constitution and the law on the preservation of and use of natural and cultural wealth"". I think it would be useful in this introductory section to specify the provisions of Article 52 which directly concern the forest and forest land on which this item was quoted by Mr. Sagar, so I won\'t repeat it here. Furthermore, the Forest Act is a fundamental act in the area of forestry which regulates the cultivation, protection, use and availability of forest and forest land as a natural wealth, with the aim of maintaining biodiversity and ensuring forest management on the principles of economic sustainability of social responsibility and environmental acceptability. This law seeks to achieve a long-term legal framework for the achievement of the optimal measure between forest management on the one hand and forest protection on the other hand, all aimed at delivering raw materials to the wood industry and the population and rural development as a strategic need, given demographic developments in our country. Since the adoption of the last Law on Forests in 2005, more amendments have been made and the addition of the law has also been intervened by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia in some articles, the Law on the Agricultural Advisory Service has also been amended, and a new Law on the Agriculture and Forestry Advisory Service has been adopted in the meantime. This new law amends or supplements more than half of the existing law and requires the adoption of a new forest law. This bill regulates the principles under which the Government of the Republic of Croatia manages forests and forest land in the interests of the Republic of Croatia according to the principle of public, predictability, the principle of effectiveness and the principle of accountability. All of this is essentially contained in the principle of sustainable management of natural resources. Forests are by water our most significant natural resource, forests and forest land are a special natural wealth which is managed in a sustainable and environmentally acceptable way. This law provides for the establishment of a register of the forest economic area of the Republic of Croatia to be conducted in electronic form. It is a desire to establish such a register to generate savings, to facilitate access to all interested, data, information on the entire management area of forestry. The register should also contribute to better control of the traceability of transport and wood products, which we recently passed a law adapting to EU regulations. The law in Article 14 provides for the definition of forest owners and the division of private forest owners into small, medium and large, which is new compared to the existing law. I believe that the objective of this article and these divisions is to provide additional assistance to small and medium-sized forest owners by releasing certain costs or actions in other legal ways. And all of this should result in such a way as to enable the protection and survival of small and medium-sized forest owners, while raising the quality of forests which they master or which are owned by them, because we need to know that today the forests are owned by small, medium-sized forest owners in much worse shape than the forests which are dominated by the state. Real estate legal relations in the possession of forests and forest land owned by the Republic of Croatia are governed by this law and comply with the basic rules in the area of availability and management of state assets, areas of strategic investment projects, areas of environmental protection and nature, as well as areas of spatial planning. This is arranged and simplified in a way that gives an opinion on spatial plans by the ministry a prerequisite for the separation of forests and forest land owned by the Republic of Croatia, which are spatial plans covering a building area or a separate building area. The process of establishing the right of service and the right to build on forests and forest land for the purpose of building infrastructure has also been brought together, the process of detaching individual forest land owned by the Republic of Croatia and the forest-economic area for agricultural purposes, also allows for the reverse process of including agricultural areas which are in the nature of forests in the forest-economic areas, i.e. the forest-economic base. This would respect the real situation in space and clearly, and one and the other process cannot be carried out without the agreement of the agricultural and forestry profession. I\'d say a few words about compensation for other useful forest functions, so-called. OkFŠ, it is detained at the current level with a rate of 0.0265% on total income of legal and natural persons carrying out economic activity in the Republic of Croatia, the change is in the works so that the fee would not be paid by companies with a total income of less than 3 million kuna. Recommendations on the compensation for the OCFŠ are constantly accessible and clearly there are demands from economic operators who look at their interest and believe that, in the latter case, some kind of parafiscal charge, even if I agree entirely with the State Secretary\'s opening explanation that it is not all other than that, and I will also say why. And I think it prevailed here and this quite justified thinking that this fee is necessary in order to manage forests and forest land in karst areas, to forest, to carry out breeding work, to build and maintain fire-fighting averages, to generally co-finance the fire system, to cover the cost of recovery of kalamite in the economic forests, to finance demining forests and forest land, to finance scientific research in the area of forestry and ecosystems that have a practical application in the protection of forests. And here on this point, I will only quote the final sentence from the memos sent to the Government of the Republic of Croatia by all relevant institutions dealing with forestry, starting with the Academy through colleges, institutes, forestry chambers, forestry societies. So they are appealing not to reduce the compensation for the general useful functions of the forest because it has already been reduced twice, and there we have found justification in the economic and economic state of the state that it is necessary to relieve the economy but since we have left the recession, I think there is no reason for this fee to be reduced already we should think that we are potentially increasing it because I say, it is precisely known what this fee is used for. Here\'s an example of how 48 million kunas were invested last year only in demining forests and forest surfaces and there\'s still a lot of forests and forest surfaces that aren\'t demining and the resources are certainly needed days to speak for everything else. But I say, here, I will only quote the last sentence of this letter sent to the Government of the Republic of Croatia: ""We appeal that you do not allow a reduction or even a suspension of the compensation for the KEFŠ because such a measure would have a negative impact on the overall ecosystem and the population and in the long term also on the economy. Why bring down a well-designed and functional system that has a clear goal? In this case, the state will need to find new sources of financing of the above-mentioned needs for its forests, which the Constitution also found to have its special protection."" I have already stated that all in the signature of this memo. And yet around the OKFSH, there were different questions here, so one question was, what was the amount of that BOX. When the rate was 0.07%, I think the largest amount collected annually was just over 500 million kuna. These sources co-financed all of this. We came today, let the assistant minister correct me afterwards, to some amount of 120 to 140 million kuna, depending on the effectiveness of the bill, etc. These are just too little resources to make all of this count, which should be financed from that fee more if we know that under the current Regulation almost half the demining, fire system and scientific research. So only 50, maybe 60% of these funds are used for the management of forests on karst or for works on these forests and relatively percentages of the share of state property and private forest properties are allocated and this remaining share, means that through that part of the OkFŠ and the forest owners get, here is the 80-20 that the relationship but is no longer such a relationship, the relationship is now 75 to 25, so around 1/4 of the forest in Croatia is owned or not owned by the state. And by that percentage, the OCFSH is also deployed. I don\'t want to talk about OKFSH anymore, if there\'s going to be a chance in the replicas I\'m going to say some more things. The public debate showed great interest in this law, which is not even strange because there were a large number of proposals and objections to the law from which the ministry adopted part, which shows that both the nature, the forest and our environment are of great concern. It is said here about the Croatian forests, some things Mr Batinić explained in his replica as to, say, the exports of the troops themselves, that Croatian forests do not export any cubic logs. The troupes are dealt with, or exported by those who buy logs from the Croatian forests, which is the wood industry. I\'ll go back to this, but I\'d say one thing about employees of the Croatian Forests, workers of the cutlers, forest workers, and a little bit of that, and Mr. Sagar, we need to know that the job of the chopper workers at this point is the hardest job in the Republic. We have no more mines, we have no miners, this is physically the most demanding job in the Republic of Croatia, and it should be adequately rewarded and rewarded, because teaching these people together are forest technicians and forest engineers, meaning it was in Croatian forests and -15, when we were in the warm here in the assembly and the vast majority of the people working in the economy were somewhere where different conditions were, and the main season is cut for Croatian forests, or generally in forestry and private forest is from 01.10 to 31 March. So, at the worst of times. But it is clearly cut where the regulations are allowed and in the other part of the year, so that the criticisms that go to the account of the Croatian forests are partly justified, but they are not, in part, safe because Croatian forests are not only designed for the cutting of forests, however, it is a sort of side role for you, but rather for them to grow and restore, to maintain the forest system in this form as it is now, but also to improve it. I can\'t tell you everything, but a national forest strategy has been mentioned. She exists. I don\'t know, all those who said there was no national forest strategy, there was a national forest policy and strategy, it was brought in 17th of July 2003. She\'s not, she should certainly be redefined and renewed, but she exists as such. As something will be cut, counterpart Marta Luc-Polanc talked about it, as it is cut, what kind of machinery goes into the woods, etc., so she\'s a lawyer and she\'s working in the Croatian forests, and I think she should know that it\'s better to let the foresters define it because it\'s being studied at the Forest College, from the direction of the shooting, from the direction of the train, and all in order to protect the forest floor and the forest itself, because, as we say, 95% of it, we restore our forests naturally, and that\'s how it is done as little damage to that young plant that grows out of the ground when we shoot down, when we extract the wood mass. And one more thing I\'m going to give you to think about, I\'m not going to be able to say everything that I\'ve planned here, if we plant or put in the country of the jury today, let\'s know that some generation, if there\'s not a big climate change happening in 140 years, that oak will cut down. Then he will be full of maturity and will make the greatest contribution in the economic part of the tree. So 140 years. What we\'re cutting off today\'s mostly oak income was planted 140 years ago or raised. We take care of that when we talk about forests and I hope, here, that the HDZ Club will support this law. Thank you very much.', 'Dear Vice President of the National Assembly, honourable Members of the People\'s Parliament, it is my pleasure to be back here with you two weeks later in the National Assembly and to be able to explain to you today an extremely important law from the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and the protection of the environment. It is about the Law amending and supplementing the Law on Forests, the Law of which we expect to significantly improve the current situation in the area of forestry of the Republic of Serbia. If you\'ll excuse me, I\'d like us to all remind ourselves together of what the forest is like as a natural resource and as well as of the general interest, and then, personally, to explain to you the most important proposed changes and additions to this law. Forests as natural resources and good of general interest were always an important factor in the development of the state and were a source of goods, services, and thus the income of the total society. The state of the forest represents a mirror of the cultural and historical development of the state, the relationship of man, society and state towards the forest, is conditioned by the social needs that change over centuries, but also by its natural legality, large and open space, the long duration of the production process and renewableity. It is these characteristics of the forest that indicate the need and possibility of sustainable use, permanent existence and relatively slow improvement. Forests are a source of wood as raw materials, but also a place where biodiversity is preserved, as well as a place for recreation and many other economic, ecological and social benefits that the social community has from forests. Because of this, modern forestry sets a general goal for the social community to be made available to the desired good. The dynamics of social change, hence the requirement of the forest, suggests the complexity of establishing a forest management system and the need for a permanent improvement of the strategic and legislative framework. In order to satisfy different interests and needs in the same space, and without being compromised as a resource, the concept of sustainable forest management has been established. The UN Environment and Development Conference, held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, marks a turning point in relation to the environment and the use of natural resources, the launch of a number of global and regional processes from which the concept of sustainable forest management has arisen. The concept implies the management of forests and forest land in a way that sustains and improves their production capacity, biodiversity, restoration and vitality. In this way, in the present and the future, it is ensured that the environmental, economic and social functions of the forest are met without causing damage to the surrounding ecosystems. The forest law is one of the instruments within the system of sustainable forest management, which provides for the implementation of that principle. When it comes to forests in the Republic of Serbia, the total forest area is 2,252,400 hectares, in which high natural forests are represented with 621,200 hectares or 27.6%. The published natural ingredients are present at 1,456,400 hectares or 64.6%, and 174.800 hectares, i.e. 7.8% are artificially raised forests. Other forest land is represented by 382,400 hectares. The total area of forest and forest land is 2,634,800 hectares. Given that Serbia\'s noise level today is 29.1%, as well as that the optimal level is the same according to Serbia\'s spatial plan, 41.4%, but also that the forest structure is dominated by publishing, i.e. forests of less quality, it is clear that the situation is not satisfactory. Therefore, systematic, long-term plans and programmes are needed, including relevant legislation, which will take into account, among other things, all the common useful functions of the forest, which are also wood production, as the main products, and the preservation of forest ecosystems, such as wealth, wild flora and fauna and a number of others. In addition to all the above, it should always be borne in mind that the value of the cut wood mass on a log in Serbia is around 60m euros annually. But if other economic benefits are added to this, such as secondary employment, which depends on wood as raw materials, ecological and social functions created annually in Serbian forests, the total monetary value of Serbian forest products and services is about 700m euros per year. This unequivocally suggests that the ecological, economic and economic benefits produced from forests are much greater than what official statistics show as the benefit of Serbian society from forests. The draft amending and supplementing the Law on Forests has created a burning problem in the forests and forestry of the Republic of Serbia. These amendments and additions to the Law on Forests gradually address problems in the area of conservation, protection, use and availability of forest and forest land as natural wealth, the issue of surveillance, as well as other issues of importance for forests and forest land in order to achieve the objectives set by the Strategy for the Development of Forestry of the Republic of Serbia. An important forest law, adopted in 2010, has led to some positive changes in the forestry sector, but during its application, it has been found that during the previous five-year period there are also certain shortcomings that have caused negative effects on Serbia\'s forests. With amendments and additions to the Forest Law, we remove perceived problems and shortcomings, and also, the proposed solutions we are going to meet in the future to warn potential problems in the future. In addition, several legal regulations and decisions directly reflected in the forestry sector have been adopted in the period from 2010 to now, and the existing law was necessary to comply with these rules. This applies first of all to the Constitutional Court Decision of 13 July 2012 concerning the jurisdiction of the AP Vojvodina in the field of forestry, one of which has been returned to the Republic. This refers to the authority that the Republic of Serbia regulates forestry in the AP territory and ensures that public interest is achieved in the area of forestry, respecting all competences that the province continues to have in this area. Also, after the adoption of the Law on Public Enterprises in 2012 there was a commitment made to the founders of public enterprises to coordinate the founding act of public undertakings with that law. In view of the fact that JP ""Serbishum"", which runs with more than 90% of forests in the territory of the Republic of Serbia, was established by the Law on Forests of 1991 and that these provisions remained in force after the adoption of the 2010 Forests Act, these amendments and additions to the Law on Forests and provisions are put out of force, and the JP ""Serbian"" is obliged to comply with the provisions of the Law on Public Enterprises. As a particular problem, we have seen the phenomenon of devastation and deforestation of state forests that have no users, or someone who would boss these forests on behalf of the state as owners. In the privatisation process of various social enterprises, cooperatives and the like, forests were excluded because, as well as good of general interest, they could not be the subject of privatisation. On the other hand, the 2011 Law on Public Property prescribed that the legal regime of construction land, agricultural land, forests and forest land in public property is governed by a special law, and no such provision exists in the current Law on Forests, resulting in several tens of thousands of hectares of state forests which are not managed by anyone. Since it\'s open space, big surfaces, these woods are always hit by poachers. The proposed law amending and supplementing the Law on Forests establishes a legal basis for the Government, on a proposal from the Ministry of Forest Affairs, to determine the users of those forests that meet the legal requirements, which will safeguard those forests from illegal use and manage them on the principle of sustainability and improvement of the situation. According to the current Law on Forests, state forests in the Republic of Serbia are the owners of, above all, public forest management companies, whose founder is the state of Serbia, i.e. an autonomous province. Extraordinaryly, forest tree safety belts created by the reforestation of state land after 2010 can also be managed by public enterprises, which are the founder of local self-government units. This norm does not respect the fact that a good part of the forest, in the vicinity of cities, and even in cities, is managed by local public utility companies, which is the founder of units of local self-government. As an example, we can cite the JKP ""Green"" Belgrade, which runs part of the forest in the territory of the city of Belgrade, such as Zvezdarska, Miljakova Forest, and it is similar in other cities of Serbia. With this law, we have respected the reality and prescribed that public enterprises, whose founder of units of local self-government, which have managed state forests until the law was passed, can also manage these forests in the future, provided that they meet the conditions laid down in the Law on Forests and Specific Regulations. In addition to the above reasons relating to the rights of editing, availability and management of forests, there are also narrow professional reasons for amending the Law on Forests, above all, in the area of forest management planning, wood traffic and criminal policy. In the area of forest management planning, a new spatial planing continent is introduced, i.e. The forest area. In total, eight forest areas are established, one in the territory of autonomous provinces and six in central Serbia. Forest areas are established by uniting existing forest areas that represent spatial and natural continents, providing more meaningful and rational planning in forestry. Often weather disasters and climate change, in general, cause major damage to forests, such as floods, floods, floods, rinks, ice-loms, wind-loms, insect gradations, etc., which often occur and decrease from year to year in the field of forestry and do not provide the sustainability of forests in certain territories, therefore require more investment in prevention and recovery of damaged areas. Amendments to the Law on Forests allow for more effective treatment and response in the event of natural disasters, on the one hand the Ministry and on the other hand users and forest owners. In this regard, we have suggested that the release of the obligation of owners and users of forests to pay compensation for the use of forests in the event of the recovery of natural disasters, because in such situations it is not possible to talk about the use of forests. The provisions governing the transport of wood have been significantly improved. The aim of these amendments is to enable traceability, i.e. origin of wood in transport, and to give full jurisdiction to the Republic forest inspectors in the area of wood traffic control, which is limited by their applicable law, which, among other things, led to an increased volume of illegal woodcutting and traffic. Finally, criminal provisions have been extended, so that all actions are sanctioned against the provisions of the law, and there is an additional tightened criminal policy in the handling of competent courts, among other things, in the mandatory statement of the measure of confiscation of cases committed to the enforcement of infringements under this law, and all of this with the aim of introducing a system and control in the use of forest resources. In addition to complying with applicable regulations, the adoption of this law allows for the resolution of some of the current problems in forestry, primarily in the part of the protection of forests against illegal use and destruction, then, the efficiency of the work of the Republic forest inspection, through greater powers in the field of wood traffic control, and a more severe criminal policy. As part of the forest protection system, it is especially important to highlight the establishment of a mechanism for the protection of state forests that do not have users, which I have already spoken of. As an illustration of the significant problem, the illegal cuttings, we cite data from research done in several projects on the consumption of biomass in Serbia, which showed that around six million metres of cubic trees are spent annually in the Republic of Serbia. According to official statistics, however, the amount of wood in transport from state forests is around 1,935,000 metres of cubic meters, and from private forests about 871,000 metres of cubic, a total of 2,806,000 metres of cubic meters. It follows that nearly half of the wood in Serbia is not registered, which does not mean that the amount of wood and potential items of theft, but partly the owners of the forest are avoiding the requirement to mark the cutting trees, so-called. This is because they also avoid the obligation to pay compensation for the use of forest at the level of 5% of the market value of wood varieties at the site of the cutting, which makes it practically impossible to determine the origin of wood and possible illegal acquisition. The theft. By reducing the volume of illegal cuttings, good management will also be provided and more inflows of funds into the Republic\'s budget, by better payment of forest charges. The creation of responsible and appropriate legal assumptions is undoubtedly a very important element in the system of sustainable forest management, as one of the basic principles of forestry, but must only be understood as one segment of the permanent process of creating and improving the system in order to meet the strategic objectives of the forestry sector. We expect the measures proposed by this law to contribute to the improvement of the state of the forest in the Republic of Serbia, thereby increasing the participation of the forestry sector in the gross social product of the Republic of Serbia, thus increasing the participation of the forestry sector in the overall social and economic development of our country.

My Dear Ones Ladies and gentlemen on the Government Bank! Ladies and gentlemen to the National Council! Ladies and gentlemen in front of the TV screens and at the audience gallery! I would like to begin by congratulating the members of the government on fishing. They have taken on an important responsibility. In her hand lies the skill of Austria over the next five years, and I am not willing to wish them a happy hand for their decisions. I think it\'s like this: Once you put this whole turquoise incense and the blue thinst on the side and deal with the facts, you can see that the initial conditions for a federal government are probably as good as they are today. We are on an absolute record course in economic growth. And because today the comparison with Germany has been drawn: In 2005 – Mr. Bundeskanzler Kurz said it – we looked at Germany and said that the better Germany was Austria. And the Germans envyed us at the time. At the time, we had an economic growth of 2.1 percent in Austria. Today, as you know, we are a whole percentage point of this. That is to say, the initial conditions are such that we are actually the better Germany today, and I would like that the measures and activities of this federal government do not playful by the contribution of many that we have laboriously worked out. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] I have learned a lot today, even as far as your personal preferences are concerned, and I mean not the last sentences of the Lord Vice-Chancellor, but his confession and his love for Goethe. And if I remember what has been listed on this political stage in Austria in recent months in Austria, I have a little feeling that we have been hanging in the foreplay at the Faust, and now we are all waiting for finally to appear in the prologue of Mephisto. [[Abg. Hauser: The SPÖ!]] [[Abg. Hauser: We have experienced this in the election campaign!]] History seems to be only those – and so I understood the concept here – that we can wait even longer here, because, obviously, until the country elections are all completed in spring, essential parts of your truth will not be experienced. [[Abg. Gudenus: The Pudel\'s core!]] I find this remarkable and do not find it all right. And I tell you why this is so: because we have seen exactly this procedure in Upper Austria. There was time until the National Council election until one came out with all the truth behind the curtain, and this whole truth then ended up in cancellations for the children, in cancellations for the family, in cuts for the disabled and in cuts for art and cultural workers. [[Abg. Haider: That\'s not true at all! That\'s not true! Where was that?]] This is exactly what you can expect if you read your program precisely. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] My proposal is: Let us look behind the words, let us see what is the substance of what has been presented, and let us ask ourselves what to think of this programme! I give Mr Kurz the following: In fact, this programme did not offer any surprises. There has been no surprises because, at least from my point of view – and this will not surprise you – it involves a number of setbacks in social policy, in economic policy, in social policy and also in environmental matters. I can also say that I would like to give Mr. Vice-Chancellor Strache a word when he says: Yes, we have not reached 100 percent!, but I want to add – I don\'t want to call it a word of the year now –: This is really the understatement of the year! Because if I look at exactly what\'s inside this program, I have to say: Of what you promised before the election, I find it best to find homeopathic doses. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] I have been given the impression – and, with engagement, that is – that we have had a debate on the elections and, subsequently, we have had a government formation in which promises and announcements have been placed on board at the record pace. I understand that in recent years you have really tried to get your image that you are the representative of the little people that you are the fighters, the upright and the wakeners against the system and against the felt of all provenance. If I look at what is left of it today, I can only say: You\'ve betrayed your voters very well. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] [[Abg. Haider: That\'s just you!]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Singer.]] They have become the leader of a policy which essentially benefits the major donors of the ÖVP\'s election campaign. [[Abg. Listen:... SPÖ party match! Talk such a fool!]] I have to tell you, on the one hand, it is easy to criticize things in opposition, but on the other hand, it is so that you are today as a vice-channer, as a Freedom Party in a position in which it is no longer grudging, what is happening, but now you really have the responsibility for what people\'s living conditions are in real hands. That is why it is worth looking at exactly what you are proposing and what that will mean. I\'m sorry if I can handle this celebration with facts, but we\'ve dealt with your programme very carefully. [[Call the FPÖ: “Facts”!]] Let us look, for example, at what I believe is one of the greatest challenges: the fight against unemployment. Unemployment is a social scandal, we must not take notice of it. However, this programme contains a proposal from your side, which is aimed at massively collapsing the employment programmes for those over 50 years old. [[Abg. Deimek: Employment...!]] Now, considering what that means, who is affected, it is noted: For example, there are 53-year-olds who have issued hundreds of application letters that are able to do something that is competent, that can do something and that in many cases do not even get an answer. – These are the people you now throw the door in front of the nose! Not enough with it: They not only delete the programmes that give these people hope and a future perspective, but they are going one step further, because in Your programme is very clearly stated that you propose a reduction in unemployment benefit in the event of longer unemployment – you call it degressive unemployment benefit – and that results in people actually being pushed into poverty and any hope being taken away from them. That\'s not enough, because if you continue to read your program exactly – and I can tell you it\'s a worthwhile exercise; Perhaps you should do this again in epic width – then you can see that, with the removal of emergency aid, people are entering the minimum security after prolonged unemployment. Do you know what that means? – They not only give these people no hope, they not only take their job, but at the end of a professional life take away from them everything they have built up, saved and created work with their hands for a lifetime. That\'s your policy! [[Conjugation with the SPÖ and the Abg. Kolba.]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Deimek.]] I also think it is remarkable that, if you continue reading, you can see that, a few paragraphs later, these people, who are providing minimum security, then still want to donate to the employment service. I\'m asking you straight now: How can you demand this programme, this policy and look at these people, at the end also humble them for their fate? Your policy is a policy that is directed against the poor and not against poverty! [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] If you complain about someone saying that this is a Hartz IV model for Austria, if you say it isn\'t, then I\'m right, because that\'s worse, that goes on in many points. The picture, the social image that you spread behind it, is one where you say unemployment, that is a self-elected fate!, and in doing so, let\'s take care that today in Austria, six unemployed people stand up for a job. [[Interlocutory call to the ÖVP]] – That’s the problem, and these are the questions we need solutions for! [[Abg. Haider: That you have created!]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Singer.]] [[Abg. Höbart: Social democracy has done a lot!]] Ladies and gentlemen! In the run-up to this election debate, we have also dealt intensively with the question of the design of the working world. One of the key questions was whether there should be the possibility for a 12-hour working day in Austria, a possibility which has been developed compared to today\'s situation. [[Call ÖVP:Plan A!]] I still have it in my ears, as you have said, that can\'t happen under any circumstances, it\'s anti-performance and I don\'t know what. You were against it, you said you didn\'t want to. [[Call the FPÖ: There\'s been a long time!]] What do you say to the people you are looking at exactly this policy? What do you say to the people who get up at 4 o\'clock in the morning, commuting to Vienna, going to work for two hours, who are now allowed to work twelve hours, 60 hours a week, and which you are not prepared to offer the slightest compensation for this deterioration? [[Abg. Haubner: Mr. Kern, please!]] [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] [[Call the FPÖ: Inconceivable!]] I have your words in the ear, and I know your excuse – and you have managed to speak to one or the other –; They say: It\'s all just voluntary! – Anyone who has once been in a business in his life knows how far it is with this voluntaryness. [[call to the FPÖ.]] They also claim that this will, of course, not cost overtime supplements. Quite honest: Look Why don\'t you take a look at the models, how this really works? The key to the overtime question is throughput periods, and it is good, proven practice in Austria that the trade unions negotiate collective agreements, where settlement periods are defined; this protects workers. If you shift this to the operational level, then change the balance; then change the balance in favour of employers, and the workers remain. I\'ll tell you: Your model will lead to the removal of overtime supplements for people in Austria under guarantee and with certainty. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Deimek.]] This can be continued. I can tell you, if you believe the voters don\'t notice that, then that\'s, I think, a capital deception. You demand a fair rental right, fairness is required here. The exciting question is: Fairness for whom? It should be thought to us that the association of interest-rate homeowners and large landowners has broken out in jubilation; they do not do so by about, for they know what is coming. [[New call for tender of the Abg. Deimek.]] [[Abg. Höbart: Say the...owner\'s core!]] And they also know what that means on the opposite side, what has been enforced, namely deterioration in rental contracts in founding houses. I wonder what you explain to the young families who already spend 50 percent of their income on rents today. Will you tell them honestly: Yes, all of this will become even more expensive, because of course we will pay attention to the fairness for homeowners and homeowners!Unknown term type: ""%s"".? [[Abg. Rosary: Why should we lie to them?]] – Of course you won’t. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] How will you explain to the little people that their children will have to pay tuition fees in the future, that social barriers will be created? I understand that burgers feel comfortable in elitist clubs, but that\'s an educational policy that says: [[Cheerfulness of Deputies Haider and Höbart as well as a call for tender from the Abg. Deimek]] Elites have to stay under themselves! And this is a policy that represents a step back into a distant past. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] Dear ladies and gentlemen of the FPÖ, I understand your emotions, but do you know what the truth is? – They have jumped into the tiger costume and are finished as bedheads. [[Abg. New builder: (keeping a document in height) That\'s your truth! That\'s your truth! You can pay a second salary by the taxpayer!]] That\'s the reality! [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Singer.]] You know, I still understand that if you say that there are major reforms that will change our country for the better. But if you look at these reforms, what remains? – Today in the morning, in the “Morgenjournal” it was to be heard that you celebrated the biggest reform you have to offer is the aggregation of social security institutions to five. - Bravo! But what are you really doing? – They change the door signs, more is it not, because if you say that the countries should continue to maintain budgetary sovereignty, the countries should continue to maintain their sovereignty, then nothing exactly happens. [[call to the FPÖ]] [[Congratulations to Mr Loacker and Mr Strolz]] You will not save a cent with this policy, I can already prophesy it to you. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] [[Abg. Deimek: 129...!]] But what you do with it, and this is the perfide on it, is the following: They are changing the situation in our country again because self-management was an important principle of compensation between workers and employers. [[Abg. Haider: Good luck! Fortunately, the conditions are changed!]] [[Further calls to the FPÖ]] What you are doing now is to change the conditions of power, to the workers who will be in this system those who remain on the track. If you say, Well, we are saving in the system and not in people!, then I can only point you to a small point, a mistake of thought that is like a red thread through this program; let\'s stay at the General Insurance Institute: They say we should save 500 million euros. But what are they doing? – They maintain the accident hospitals that entertain the rehabilitation centers. These 500 million euros, which are to be saved, are contributions from employers in Austria. If you delete these now, you have two options: The one is, you shorten the benefits for the people in the country, the other is, you force the workers to pay higher contributions. I\'ll tell you one thing: Then please don\'t come here and say you\'re saving in the system and not with people, because it\'s the other way round! [[Consistency with the SPÖ and the Abg. Bißmann.]] I would like to address a point that I find remarkable, because it has also been quoted today. You\'ve been proud to tell you that you\'ll relieve the small incomes. I would like to add: I think that\'s right. You can certainly discuss the action you have taken. [[Call the FPÖ:Don\'t discuss, make! We\'ll do it!]] But one thing is not right, and I would suggest that we should be orientating on one of our predecessors as Chancellors, who once said not to believe their own lavender. But the point is: What you do with this proposal to reduce unemployment insurance contributions is good, but 3.4 million Austrians are looking through their fingers – pensioners get nothing, and all those who earn less than EUR 1 380 do not benefit from it. If you\'re proud and say, Also with the family bonus we relieve the small incomes!, then I have to tell you: This is not so, because a single parent who has two children who earn less than EUR 1 250 will receive the proposal 0 cent discharge. [[Abg. Schimanek: You have long forgotten them in social democracy!]] They also look through their fingers again, because this discharge can only be achieved to the full if you earn more than 2 500 euros – with two children. Do you know what the bad thing about it is? – That in the end you have not only a financial mathematical error, but that you end up with a principle – with a principle that we were rightly proud of! – and this principle has stated that every child in our country must be of equal value. What you\'re demonstrating here is that this is no longer the case and that children from poor families are less valuable than children from rich families. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] I also find it remarkable that everything in the programme, such as social justice, is a fair tax system. They announce corporate tax reductions, which is sold with the argument regarding small and medium-sized enterprises. We know that this is nonsense, because most of it does not pay corporate tax at all. But the remarkable thing is what is not inside. They have announced in the election campaign that we are consistently fighting the tax avoidance practices of international companies, that we are no longer going to let Starbucks, Amazon and Co roll, which in our country use the full infrastructure but do not pay taxes. We believed that we were satisfied that you were finally swirling on our course. If you look at this programme now, you can suddenly see that the transparency obligations of these groups should only happen in line with the EU, that models such as the digital facility, which finally pay taxes in Austria, should only happen in accordance with the EU. In other words: It won\'t come. [[Abg. Rosary: Your anti-EU holding is great!]] And if you wonder why this is so, you have to say: That\'s where you protect the wrong people again. I know well enough that there are also enough Austrian companies that are of course lobbying their feet in front of your door. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] Lighthouses, an interesting keyword: We have expected – and you have stressed this over and over again – that it is about change, it is about a new time, it is about taking advantage of the opportunities of the future. When I look at the challenges and opportunities we face, I have to say that I really regret that your programme does not support them. Digitalization appears as a keyword, but the crucial questions are not answered: How does this continue with our social system? How\'s work going? How\'s the tax system going? How will Austria beat itself in a global world? How do we deal with climate change? Don\'t be angry with me. I believe that what you have said as progress that the Ministry of Agriculture is now responsible for energy is a threat because I know that this will result in even more money for the large-scale agricultural industry. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] How do we deal with inequality? – All of this would have been suitable projects for real lighthouse policy, but your lighthouses consist of a mountain of empty cigarette boxes. [[Interlocutory calls from Mr Gerstl and Mr Rädler]] They lead Austria back to a retro concept of the 1970s. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ.]] [[Abg. Rosenkranz: (Referring to the Mimik of the Federal President Van der Bellen) The President of the Federal Republic feels addressed!]] [[Abg. Höbart: Deeply frustrated!]] I can still come to the issue of the European Union: It is indeed gratifying to hear that there has been a corresponding confession, and I consider it to be the least and most necessary. However, I would like to add that only the fact that you agreed that Austria is not leaving the European Union or not leaving the euro is far from a pro-European policy. And I have to tell you: As long as the Freedom Party makes a common case with a Le Pen, with a wilder, with a farage, as long as – you know as well as I do – we will not be taken seriously at European level as far as our European policy is concerned. [[Abg. Rosary: (delighted) Now it\'s always going to be colorful!]] [[Conjugation with the SPÖ and the Abg. Stroll.]] [[Abg. New builder:... still in North Korea today!]] The challenge to me – and we have seen this in tax policy – is: We need pan-European solutions, we need a commitment to deepening, we need a commitment to integration – and we do not need a European policy based on less, slower, subsidiarity, as you understand it. [[Abg. Rosary: What now?]] Macron has stretched out his hand for a progressive, offensive European policy. I think that if we were to accept this, it would not put us on the side of Orbán and Kaczyński. [[Congratulations with the SPÖ as well as with representatives of NEOS and List Pilz.]] Finally, let me return to the input motive of the change! This change has often been proclaimed, from my point of view it is a change back; it is not time for new things, it is the time for old ones. However, a change has actually occurred, it is visible with a clear eye, and I can only congratulate the colleague on this: What you have done, Federal Chancellor Kurz, is you have brought FPÖ into government responsibility. That\'s your good right, it\'s in a democracy such that it can happen, that\'s the normal sequence of majority. [[Intrusion of the Abg. Smart]] But I think it would only be fair if you took on this responsibility to stand up and say: Yes, I\'ve planned this a long time, that\'s the government alliance I wanted! , and no excuses would be found – but if you were to assume responsibility for the fact that top jobs are occupied in the bureaucracy in Austria with people who scrambled on the edge of right-wing extremism, if you were to assume responsibility for Israel\'s not wanting to cooperate with a substantial part of the Austrian government, and would also assume responsibility for opening up access to the security device to this Freedom Party and providing it with the intelligence services; this is a historic merit that will remain secure. [[Abg. New builder: As you the Faymann...!]] [[Oh-Rufe at the FPÖ]] [[President Sobotka gives the bell sign]] [[Abg. Riemer: Awesome!]] [[Abg. Schimanek: The princess on the peas!]]', ""The crisis is not over. I can neither promise nor promise that we will no longer have a crisis situation in 2023. But what we can say today is that with this budget we are responding to the current challenges and as far as possible taking care of them if the state has to help to save lives to a large extent again. At the same time – this is also very important – we also invest in the topics of the future. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Ladies and gentlemen, it is probably the most difficult times we have experienced since the Second World War that people in this country and also this generation of politicians are facing. This is due to the multiple crises that we all have to deal with together. Until 2.5 years ago, the people in Austria probably only knew the word pandemic in connection with distant countries and the word economic crisis was a term from the history books for many. Meanwhile, both terms shape our daily life. People also feel that times are more difficult. Since the outbreak of the Covid Pandemic in Austria in February 2020, politics has been required at all levels – at federal, national and municipal level. With unprecedented restrictions, necessary restrictions, and also billions of aid measures, all local authorities have contributed to bringing people through this crisis to the best possible use of jobs and businesses. I would like to say thank you all for taking on responsibility for the country, for society, for the state as a whole and for putting it in the service of the general public at this very difficult time. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] However, it is also clear that we all feel the consequences of pandemic and economic crisis, that those responsible and all local authorities feel it especially in their budgets. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have spent EUR 46.5 billion as a federal government to protect health in order to save jobs in order to bring businesses and communities through this crisis. Even though the need for covid support has been reduced, in 2022 we spent EUR 6.8 billion on health, economics and financial stability as well as on municipalities and on our voluntary associations. At EUR 2.6 billion, human health and medical care were ensured. EUR 2.2 billion has already been paid to help companies. Also behind these figures are saved jobs on the one hand and avoided insolvency on the other. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] 597 million euros were spent on short-time work, i.e. direct, direct job security. In 2023, we have estimated 2.7 billion euros in the budget for further support with regard to the consequences of the Covid-19 Pandemic, most of them naturally for health and for preventive measures in schools. Because I have addressed the economic aid: They are also the reason – in all the partially justified criticism – why we came out of the pandemic at the beginning of 2022 much more economically than other countries. In December 2021, the Wifo confirmed and forecast a GDP growth of 5.2 percent for Austria this year, and at present it is still 4.8 percent. In the second quarter of 2022, Austrian economic performance was 3.3 percent higher than the fourth quarter of 2019, while in Germany the pre-crisis level was only reached and also the growth in the euro area as a whole was significantly lower than that of Austria. These figures show that in the pandemic we may not have done everything, yes, but still a lot of things right. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Then came a scenario with the Russian war of attack on Ukraine, which no one in Europe has included in the forecasts and which seemed completely impossible for most people in Europe: War on the European mainland, rockets on cities that are closer to Vienna than Bregenz. This war, in addition to all human tragedies, creates uncertainty among companies and insecurity among people throughout Austria. Above all, the war strengthens high inflation and the resulting inflation, which partly originated in catch-up effects from the pandemic, but also in global supply chain problems. Think of a cross-stand ship in the Sues Canal or think of a closed port of Shanghai, which also had massive effects on global supply! All these effects are reinforced by the war in Ukraine. Yes, Europe also feels the sanctions that we had to impose on Russia, and I say consciously: had to hang. Europe cannot and must not allow states to go beyond international law and a single politician decides whether a state has a right to exist or not. [[I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr President, for his excellent report and for his excellent report.]] And yes, the sanctions also affect us in Europe, but above all they hit Russia hard, and the effect becomes even stronger each month. The Russian economy is largely isolated. Russia is largely cut off from international financial markets. Throughout Europe, efforts are being made to further reduce the dependence on Russia from day to day in the energy sector. The sanctions have also led to an unprecedented conclusion within Europe, which was also underestimated by Russia accordingly. Yes, all of us, especially households and businesses in Austria, feel the effects of Russian aggression, especially in the energy sector. You have to say that honestly, too. On the other hand, we must also say what this is all about, namely that Putin uses energy and thus also the provision of citizens as a weapon in the war to achieve its objectives and to divide the Union. It was not the sanctions of Europe that turned to the gas tap. Russia did so already in 2021, and that is why you should not tell or believe any other story here. [[I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr President, for his excellent report and for his excellent report.]] Therefore, while the call for the end of the sanctions is clearly understood emotionally, no one has a guarantee that Russia will comply with its obligations. We have all seen how little we can believe the Russian announcements as a whole. We must not allow the arbitrariness of a man to decide whether our heating in Austria is cold or warm. [[Congratulation with ÖVP and Greens as well as the Abg. Künsberg Sarre.]] Therefore – and this is an important point – we all in Austria, but also across Europe, are reducing our dependence on Russia in the energy sector. But this path is still long, so we are currently in a difficult situation in which we are taking a lot of money in order to reduce our historical dependence on Russian gas while at the same time reducing the impact of high inflation on people as best as possible. I'm just saying, We will never compensate for inflation for everyone, nor can we compensate every crisis and its impact to 100 percent. Whoever promises this, ladies and gentlemen, plays with the fire and also creates an illusion for people. From my point of view, this is unscrupulous and not my access to politics. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This is simply not possible at inflation rates of 9 to 10 percent, and even at inflation rates such as in Estonia with more than 25 percent. Of course, policy must take measures to relieve people in this situation, but that also means acting considerately, and that is, above all, not to give in to seductive calls, because not all that is popular is also reasonable, ladies and gentlemen, too. [[Congratulation with ÖVP and Greens as well as the Abg. Loacker.]] From my point of view, there is a need for fingertips: on the one hand, the necessary support, but at the same time, we must no longer fuel the imported inflation. Of course, it sounds tempting to simply draw a lid on the electricity price in Austria. However, this would not be useful, because it would be beneficial for us to benefit from electricity in Bavaria, Italy, the Czech Republic and Hungary through the liberalised European electricity market. [[Inter-calls at the SPÖ.]] It could even be cheaper to heat with promoted electricity instead of with other sources of energy. A blackout would also be much more likely than at the moment, and that certainly does not want any of us here. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] [[Abg. Lightenness: Do we not decide now?]] We therefore take the serious path with our discharge measures. We do this, for example – and this is the difference – with a power price brake, ladies and gentlemen, which continues to allow market signals, but also directly inflational effects. This will benefit households in Austria and not in neighbouring countries. [[Abg. Krainer: This is especially the benefit...!]] – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have already mentioned the high level of inflation: From January to September, inflation in Austria has more than doubled from 5 to 10.5%. Thus, the current inflation rate exceeds the values during the oil crises of the 1970s and has risen to the highest level since 1952. This is the starting point before this winter and also for this budget. Against this background, our prosperity, our growth course of past years is suddenly under massive threat. Our task, namely that of all political designers at all levels, is to counteract this development. People expect from us, expect answers and solutions from politics that we have to deliver. And as I have already said, this is, of course, a challenge to our prosperity. In Germany, politicians have been talking about a loss of prosperity for months on account of the current situation. [[Abg. Kassinger: With us too!]] I find this, with all due respect, a little too little for political leadership. [[Call the NEOS: That would be honest!]] We want to bring Austria out of this crisis with new strength, and we must set the right course now, in the crisis. That is exactly what we are doing with this budget. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] We in Austria have repeatedly faced fundamental crises in our history. After that, however, we continued to be stronger and more coherent. The tasks we have to deal with are historical. I think that's where we all agree. The tides do not only concern a small part of the population, but they have arrived in the middle of society. Economic growth in Austria will be still very high this year, with around 4.8 percent, but the impact of high inflation is already increasing throughout the economy, and economic growth of 0.2 percent is forecast for 2023. During the pandemic, individual industries were particularly hard hit, particularly in the energy sector and in the costing of each sector and also in all farms in Austria. If external conditions become more difficult, we need to make it easier for citizens and businesses too. The answers to global crises can no longer be bureaucracy and no more taxes. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] [[Abg. Anger: That's why the CO2 tax?]] [[Abg. Belakovich: The CO2 charge?- Oh, my God!]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Loacker.]] - That's what I'm coming up with. The federal government has already suspended the increase of federal fees for the eleventh time. But we didn't just turn on the little screws against the inflation: This year alone, we have implemented EUR 6.3 billion for human discharge measures and we will invest more than EUR 30 billion in the coming years by 2026. At the beginning of the year, we tied two packages with a total volume of 4.4 billion euros, including emergency payments for particularly affected groups, for greater security in local agriculture, a reduction in energy taxes, a relief for commuters and much more. Much of it has been working for months, other measures are only gradually developing and will continue to be intensively budget-effective in the coming year. The third anti-estimation package from the early summer brings a total of EUR 28.7 billion in financial discharge. In the summer, we reduced those people who are the most affected to 300 euros again. There was a single payment of 180 euros as a family allowance for each child. The families also benefit from the higher family bonus plus and the extra child. A total of 500 euros for each adult and 250 euros for each child are provided by the climate and the anti-esteem bonus. With the beginning of next year, the structural reliefs that will then come, and thus we will strengthen the purchasing power of the people permanently. The State will help in the context of its opportunities when companies or jobs are at risk due to the current challenges. And yes, sometimes a federal or a population may benefit from a measure more than others. However, we have not raised expenditure on the various actors in the Covid aid sector against each other and we will not do so in the fight against inflation. It is good tradition in Austria that the state helps in the face of disasters and exceptional crises. This is true in the case of floods in Salzburg, in the case of crop failures in the Burgenland and in the case of avalanches in the west, and it is true that life is no longer palatable for people. The current inflation is not at federal borders, it is all meeting from west to east. That's why my appeal is also at this point: Let us not split in the crisis! [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] [[Abg. Anger: What about Carinthia?]] [[Abg. Belakovich:... Flood in Carinthia, Mr. Minister?]] It is important that the citizens, the citizens, the businesses, the municipalities in all the federal states can rely on the state, because it is all our tax money with which we help. We will do this in the coming year: We have budgeted EUR 2023 8.4 billion directly for the fight against inflation. [[Abg. Belakovich: Great! And the CO2 charge?]] We will help companies this year and next year with an energy cost subsidy of 1.3 billion euros and a electricity price compensation of 233.3 million euros. We still support the drivers until June 2023 with a higher penalty and a higher pendlereuro, which is about 220 million euros only in 2023. In total, we relieve commuters of a total of 420 million euros. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] All this, ladies and gentlemen, is in addition to the discharge measures under the eco-social tax reform. We have continued to stick to this very central project of the Federal Government – not despite the crisis, but precisely because of the crisis. Especially now it is necessary to relieve people, especially now it is necessary to provide incentives for the economy, and especially now it is also important to speed up ecological change. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] In the middle of the largest economic crisis since the Second World War, we have reduced the rates of wage and income tax. We have increased the family bonus plus and the additional amount of children and we have also reduced taxes for companies. As the Federal Government, we set clear priorities that not only meet the priorities of the two government parties, but also the needs of our time. We have thus implemented the greatest transformation of the tax system that ever existed. To sum up, the discharge of Austrians and the local economy alone by the eco-social tax reform by 2025 amounts to about 18 billion euros. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] We thus boost the economy, but we are also withdrawing from competitors in European competition. In my view, the eco-social tax reform also enables the bridge between the economy on the one hand and climate protection on the other. The eco-social tax reform provides incentives for environmentally friendly behaviour and sustainable investment, as every saved tonne of CO2 is also a contribution to climate change and to a peaceful Europe. We thus achieve a double dividend. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] We have seen in recent months how dangerous a dependence on fossil energy is. That is why we need to rethink in the long term, and therefore we also provide incentives for this ecological transformation. I think it's clear to all of us: Climate protection is one of the central tasks of our generation, and for this path it takes full use on the one hand, but it also needs home sense on the other, because we do not only want to dream about the energy change, but we want to implement it consistently. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] I'm convinced: In order to achieve these climate objectives in Austria, we need investment, but we also need a lot of innovation and, above all, cooperation, because all these efforts have one thing in common: They will require capital, yes, and the state will not be able to solve the problems alone either. Of course, private capital will also be necessary, and we need the population. We will promote awareness and acceptance for this transformation, because we must not lose anyone in this way – not the people and, above all, the economy. Only then do we have a chance to reach our goals. Therefore, in the context of the eco-social tax reform, we rely on incentives on the one hand, on relief on the other. We lower the rates of wage and income tax from 35 to 30 and from 42 to 40 percent. In total, we relieve the Austrians of around 11 billion euros by this reduction by 2026. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This, of course, also has a positive economic impact. According to Eco Austria, this tax reform will make the gross domestic product 1 percent higher in the medium term than without our planned measures. This also makes it clear that: In the year 2025, these measures alone account for 0.7 percent and 30% higher than without the reform. In the medium term, real net incomes will also be 2.4 to long-term 2.4 percent higher. It is therefore important that we stick to this so important measure right now, at this difficult time. I also stress the tax reform because the monthly tax relief for many people has now become almost self-evident. But it was this federal government that also implemented this tax reform. Many countries in Europe have planned tax reforms, but have also cancelled them. We are definitely continuing this path of discharge. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] In 2023, we complete the restructuring of the tax system on the employee side with the reduction of the third level of taxation. This means that the tax rate is reduced from 42 to 40 percent for income between 31,000 and 60 000 euros per year. This brings to an employee with an average income a relief of up to 580 euros per year, alone by this reduction. We will relieve companies of up to EUR 900 million a year with a reduction in corporate tax. In concrete terms, corporate taxes are reduced from 25 percent to 24 percent in 2023 and then to 23 percent in 2024. On the one hand, this creates scope for investment, but at the same time it is also an incentive for business settlements, i.e. a real competitive advantage that we will thus achieve in Austria. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] Some 80 000 Austrian companies benefit from this Köst reduction. More than two thirds of these domestic companies have a profit of less than 100 000 euros and more than half of those companies have a profit of less than 40 000 euros. So we see how wide this goes into small and medium-sized enterprises. The reduction in the corporate tax rate thus has a positive signal effect on our location. It also promotes equity education, promotes economic growth and promotes investment and employment. Also this, ladies and gentlemen, is a long articulated promise, and we are also fulfilling this promise as a federal government. While other countries are burdening them to renovate their budgets, we relieve them to remain attractive to the economy and to enable them to invest and create jobs. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Ladies and gentlemen, I understand, of course, that people are worried about high inflation and inflation. With the government's actions, we help people get through the autumn and winter. Whether it be cost compensation for particularly affected groups, whether or not the taxpayer's fee, whether tax reform, agricultural parcels, reduction of electricity tax or climate change and anti-insurance bonus: We have decided on measures for all Austrians and for every farm. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This can of course be criticised and one can also discuss any individual measure, no question at all, and yes, perhaps we go too far in some measure. We must not forget, however, that the pressures have also arrived in the middle of society, in the middle of the middle. This is about the installer that repairs the heating, it's about the baker who supplies the semitrailers, and it's about the pendler who has to go to work every day on the land. It was always clear to us as a federal government: We do not abandon people in this difficult situation. If the question is, ladies and gentlemen: Help or don't help?, of course we always decide to help, and we prefer to distribute a few fire extinguishers too much than risk a devastating surface fire. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This is also our responsibility, which we have assumed as the Federal Government, and we will continue to do so. We will do what is necessary in this crisis situation. Individual measures, ladies and gentlemen, of course, are not enough. Unlike a few months ago, the high level of inflation is forecast by many experts, of course, to accompany us even longer. We will not wake up tomorrow and inflation has suddenly fallen to a value that we have experienced before the crisis. Also the war in Ukraine and the political instrumentalization of energy by Putin will not be over immediately tomorrow. Against this background, however, the political mechanisms of the past decades are no longer working. For the first time, it is no longer enough to ensure discharge every few years with a tax reform. Therefore, we have also opted for structural measures – and these measures also started – that Austria has been discussing for many decades, but which have never been implemented in Austria: With the 1.1.2023, we'll get rid of the cold progression. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This has been a political standing requirement for some 40 years, existing in all government programmes, a often formulated confession of all parties and supposedly a thing of impossibility until this government has proved the opposite. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Serious: Many governments have tried it, many have promised, a few have perhaps tried it less strongly, we have done it. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Of course, we have also taken a serious look at which model is the right one to achieve social security, balance, but also a positive macroeconomic impact. Although some people deliberately say it incorrectly or do not want to understand it: We eliminate the cold progression to 100 percent, the state doesn't like it. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] The dimension of this abolition becomes clear only when you look at the discharges in detail: By 2026, the total savings for people in Austria amount to 18.7 billion euros. I know it's hard to explain, so a few examples to explain it as well: An average income of 2 160 euros gross per month would be worth only more than 2 000 euros next year with the cold progression, and with the abolition of the cold progression, we are opposed to this. With this income, 370 euros will remain alone next year, and over the next five years this means more net on the account. Another example to make the cold progression a little more tangible: To date, Austrians have been taxed from an income limit of 11 000 euros. Due to the abolition of the cold progression, the limit next year is 11 693 euros. Nevertheless, all those parties who have always been for the abolition of the cold progression have for months been looking for reasons why they should now suddenly vote against: too late, too false, or from the wrong party. Ladies and gentlemen! You still have the opportunity to vote in a historic decision, and I hope you will not vote against it. We as the Federal Government are at least taking this step. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This also applies – and this is the second structural part – to the valorization of social benefits: for many, many years always required, regularly here in Parliament. We are also implementing this step 2023. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] By valorizing additional social benefits, we expect 363 million euros for the state in 2023 or, if you see it positive, relief for citizens. Many benefit from this, but especially the families. ==References== In January, 2023, family allowances, child allowances, child care allowances and family allowances will be valorised. These measures alone bring about EUR 253 million higher benefits. We also index for all families the amount of child drop-off, which is paid monthly together with the family allowance. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] With the special family allowance of 180 euros per child, we paid some 3.1 billion euros to family aid this year, and in addition, the Family Bonus Plus was increased from 1 500 to 2 000 euros and the measure also retroactively from 1. In January 2022. The higher family bonus Plus and the higher child surplus since the beginning of the year still bring this year, a noticeable additional relief of 175 million euros for the families in Austria. In 2023, the relief effect by Family Bonus Plus and the additional amount of children will increase to 600 million euros. This is particularly important in difficult times: that we strengthen the families accordingly. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This structural measure shall also cover: We are doing something with it, which has been demanded by many, almost everyone for decades. Apparently it is the paradox of this federal government: We are implementing numerous sensible measures that have been called for for decades by all the political forces in this country, and yet today's opposition is criticizing the government for implementing precisely these measures. That's a little scurry. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Ladies and gentlemen! We had a political etiquette during the pandemic with many parts of Parliament. Throughout party borders, across ideology borders, we have always had the common goal of protecting health, saving jobs and businesses. This, I think, has been very, very successful. Yes, some things could have been done better or different in the reflection of history, but the basic principle that we together give the best for the country and vote together against the crisis, we have preserved this basic attitude very, very long. Now we are again – or still, better said – in an economic crisis, unfortunately even stronger by an energy crisis, by a security crisis and by an inflation crisis. The difference is just: This time, unfortunately, there is no shoulder closure. Ladies and gentlemen, I consider this to be a totally false signal to the population in the face of the historic outrages that we are currently experiencing. [[Inter-calls at the SPÖ.]] It is not a question of political ideology. It threatens the prosperity and daily life of the Austrians, and therefore, ladies and gentlemen, my request: Jump They are more often about your party political shadows and together we show the people in our country that politics takes the fears seriously, takes the concerns of the population seriously, and let us act together! [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Erasim.]] It is also not a question of small political money, but of how we can use tax money to the best possible extent for Austrians and help with this tax money as much as possible. [[Abg. Lightenness: Yes, you've seen that!]] [[Phone call at the SPÖ.]] It is clear, ladies and gentlemen, that we cannot defuse all global developments. [[Abg. Lightenness: That there are two of them!]] We cannot give any guarantees that no Austrian, no Austrian, will feel the effects of the price. But we can make the promise that the state will be there if it is needed. We have proved this in recent years, and we will continue to do so if necessary. We have helped during a historic pandemic, we have all jointly guaranteed the protection of our health system and thus also saved human lives. We have protected workers and businesses, as well as they, from the consequences of the pandemic. We have done our best, and that is why Austria has been so well hit by this crisis. [[Intrusion of the Abg. Erasim.]] The central task of the state is to help its citizens, as well as the countries and communities as a whole, and also to provide the necessary security. We have done so, and we will do so in the future. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Ladies and gentlemen, it is now about bringing our country through the crisis well and allowing stability for the future. This applies to Austria, yes, but it also applies to Europe as a whole. Even if some are constantly reproducing this: We cannot ignore what is happening in the world, neither security policy nor economic policy, because of course both have an immediate impact on stability, on growth and also on social peace in Austria. We also see this in the budget, for example, if we invest 1 billion euros for asylum and xenophobia by 2026 and 1.7 billion euros for the police. I would also like to say a word in the direction of those critics who, in the coming months, may simply take out the high expenditure of the state as a critical point. I would ask you, with all my understanding of the criticism and political day-to-day business, to consider: Behind all the figures, budget support, budget subsidies, budgets, pensioners, particularly affected people and families, small and medium-sized enterprises and jobs that we will once again bring through this crisis. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] That's what we did during the Covid Pandemic, and that's how we'll do it in the future. Over the past three years, people, businesses – small, medium and large – have been a hard test of administration and politics at all levels. Of course, they were also an unforeseen challenge for our budget, for our budget and for all the budgets in Europe, because, of course, higher expenditure also means higher debt. In 2026, therefore, the absolute debt in Austria is expected to amount to almost 400 billion euros. In the last year of the crisis, this figure was still around 280 billion euros. No matter how well you plan, no matter how much buffer you insert: No one had praised two and a half years of pandemic and a Russian war of attack in Europe. You have to be so honest. Nevertheless, we have been able to provide the necessary assistance at any time in Austria and have financed us for a very long time in the financial markets. Now, the top priority is to preserve purchasing power and to give people the security that they can continue to afford their lives. The long-term consequences for the site and the people would be much more fatal, we would not help in this crisis. Therefore: Yes, what kind of tasks! – In my definition, however, this does not mean that it costs what it wants!, but it means making the necessary one available. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] Yes, crises require extraordinary action. But they are not an excuse to bury easily meaningful ideas. That is why we must not lose sight of the long-term perspective in the face of all necessary crisis intervention, because today's debts are a heavy backpack, which our grandchildren still have to bear. That is why we must, of course, keep in mind the rise in public debt, and above all, we must pay off the debt mountain again in the medium to long term. In this budget, we can show that the Maastricht deficit will fall from 3.5 per cent to 1.6 per cent by 2026, and in the same period we expect a reduction in the debt ratio from 78.3 per cent in 2023 to 72.5 per cent in 2026. We will again be in Europe a warning and perhaps not for all the pleasant vote for a return to a sustainable budget policy. I am not saying this because it sounds good if the Minister of Finance is committed to sustainable budgets. It is quite simply a question of the house mind, a question of crisis prevention and also a question of the right handling of tax money. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] Each borrower knows: If interest increases, then less remains in the budget, less money in the household. That's how the state is doing: The very necessary interest rates of the European Central Bank in the fight against inflation have greatly increased the cost of our debt since the beginning of the year. In January, the return on ten-year bonds was still on average 0.18 percent, and we currently stand at 2.87%. In the period January to August 2021, the Federal Government made payments of 1.9 billion euros for its debts, while in the comparison period of the current year, the Federal Government's disbursements for this so-called interest rate service increased to 3.9 billion euros. This is almost EUR 2 billion more compared to the previous year, which we pay for our debts, instead of investing this money in care, education, security or digitization. By 2026, our interest expenditure will almost double from EUR 4.4 billion to EUR 8.4 billion this year. Of course, every million more debts are also delaying important projects in Austria. Therefore, a reduction in deficits is not a self-interest, not a political lovership, but it is simply a matter of commercial care. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] In Europe, there have already been countries in front of the Covid Pandemic, which were on a somewhat dangerous budgetary path. We have also regularly warned of this development. It was a message that was not so much heard in many parts of Europe and, in part, here in Parliament, and there were calls that remained largely unheard of. Until the pandemic we were on a very good path in Austria. We have reduced the debt ratio to just under 71 percent, before it has increased to around 83 percent due to the necessary measures against the Covid-Pandemy 2020. Only for comparison: Italy had a public debt of 134 percent over the same period and is currently at 148 percent debt ratio. Without the Covid Pandemic and the necessary expenditure, this government would have generated a surplus already in 2020. Solid budgetary policy is therefore not a question of ideology, it is simply a question of the house mind. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] Europe's debts are all baffling us, all in all, in the fight against inflation, and it is already the task of the Member States to set up their budgets in the medium to long term, not as their own purpose, but so that the European Central Bank also has the scope for action it needs in the fight against inflation. It's just absurd: The ECB raises interest rates and must, at the same time, decide on emergency programmes for massively indebted countries. This high level of inflation has not indebted Europe itself, but the failure of European debt and budget policies and also the failure of structural reforms have further limited the scope of the European Central Bank. Ladies and gentlemen! I believe that Corona and the current economic crisis have shifted the relations. Amounts that were perhaps negotiated for months and milestones for the resorts, for the countries, for the municipalities and, above all, for those concerned, are now partly defined as drops on the hot stone or as the right first steps and even small ones. These are sums corresponding to the annual budget of Austrian federal states, and they are partly demanded with one, I would say, lightness also under the guise of the crisis and the population as a whole communicates as a matter of course. Packages, which make up only a few million, are also publicly criticized as small things. No, ladies and gentlemen, a few millions and billions of euros of tax money are not a matter of course that you simply collect in passing by. A few million on or off don't care! [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] Because I'm being asked again and again: No, the money has not been abolished. It only has a different value in times of global crisis, and it also needs other dimensions at that time to help. But we must finally start learning to appreciate the tax money again. That is why I ask you all today – the responsibilities here in the house, the federal government, the country, the media, as well as all citizens – to: Together we made a contribution that tax money gets back the appreciation it deserves! Let us take the unimaginably high amounts of the present, which are necessary in the crisis, not as a matter of course against the state, but as something that must first be achieved! [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] My Dear Ones Ladies and gentlemen! In view of the gap between short-term measures needed to combat the crisis on the one hand and long-term debt reduction on the other, careful budgeting is also needed. Of course, this budget is not the top priority in making the individual resorts happy by fulfilling wish lists. This budget has the highest priority to do what is necessary to make people's lives more manageable and also to ensure the survival of businesses and thus jobs. Making decisions, setting priorities and sometimes saying no is not popular, but it is simply necessary. It is also not the money of the state that we distribute in the Republic. It is always the money of taxpayers. You just entrusted it to the state. It is also the money of the next generation we decide on here, and it is also the future that we will shape with it. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] It is precisely the means that we provide to this next generation in the fight against climate change, against poverty in old age, for more education, for sustainable care and social funding, and for digital change. Together, as the Federal Government, we have put in place a budget that gives the department's scope for answers to questions of the future and at the same time, and this is extremely important at this time, frees resources for crisis management. Ladies and gentlemen! We experience in many ways a change that will change our lives permanently. In the face of an unprecedented attack war in Ukraine that forces us to decide on economic sanctions against Russia, which, of course, also have an impact on our own economy, we must reduce our dependence on Russian gas. If the security situation in Europe changes, we also need to invest more in security. If a war changes the map of our continent, we also need to develop and strengthen military core competences. This is what we are doing by placing a focus on increasing security in our country with this budget. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] [[Abg. Loacker: 60 percent...!]] The topics and priorities of this budget, ladies and gentlemen, are more diverse. Digitalization changes our social life and also our working world. The challenges in the care force us to act and with our care package we also show the social manuscript of the government. In particular, climate change and the measures that are needed, however, mean a change in our consumer behaviour and in our economies as a whole. The sustainable transformation – this is a challenge that we need to tackle wisely. Only in this way do we take the opportunity for our economic location, create jobs and at the same time protect nature. It's clear: Austria needs high investments in the future to be able to vote on the energy transition. Only in this way, that is practical and in common, will we create the very ambitious goals that we have set ourselves, and the energy transition. At the same time, we also prove that we can intelligently combine climate protection on the one hand and a competitive location in Austria on the other. These changes cannot be seen from the outset either positively or negatively. It is up to all of us – politics, businesses, as well as citizens – to decide how we shape this change. It is not negative from the outset when you travel to work by public transport instead of by car. [[Abg. Mein-Risinger: What?]] But we also know the life realities of the people. Not everyone has a subway at the doorstep and we can't put a track in every valley. But, of course, as a policy, we need to create the conditions for people in remote rural areas to have a corresponding public transport network. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This also applies to the digital infrastructure that the state has to provide in order to prevent a city-country gap. We see all these challenges and we are going to meet them. We also take this budget into account intensively. Security and transformation are the main priorities for us. We are not only giving the necessary answers in the short term, but also investing specifically in areas that strengthen Austria for the future. We will also invest 1.4 billion euros in public transport and in the transformation of transport by 2026. We strengthen digitisation with 336.2 million euros. We spend 3.6 billion euros more on our educational landscape, we provide 1.7 billion euros for the implementation of the care reform, and we support the communities so that they can get well through these challenging times. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Yes, the war in Ukraine has dramatically changed the security situation in Europe. He forces all governments on the continent to critically question previous positions and attitudes to military national defence. Austria's neutrality has provided us with good services and is not at all for discussion. That does not mean, however, that we do not have to think about how we can best protect this neutrality and the citizens in this country. Our federal army has an essential protection function for the country, for the people and for democracy as a whole. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Yes, a few years ago, the federal army's orientation and financial resources were different, because the security situation in Europe was another one. However, with the Russian War of Attack, Europe has become a trace of uncertainty, and that is why we need to invest more in our security. That is exactly what we are doing with this budget. We will also invest 5.3 billion euros in the Austrian German army by 2026 – as much as never before. Compared to the current financial framework, the budget for 2023 is increasing by EUR 680 million. Yes, according to international standards, we already invest 2023 1 percent of our GDP in national defence. The aim is to spend 1.5 percent of our gross domestic product by 2027. In comparison to the past years, it has been the largest and above all the most constant increase in the budget for the Austrian army over the years. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] But we do not only understand security in the sense of military security. If you look at the points of each department, then the military, yes, as well as economic and social security is moving through this budget. We invest in new helicopters and the crisis prevention care of the police, in the social field we finance poverty prevention projects, and we provide funds for the economic stability of our companies and also for the security of the labour market. Ladies and gentlemen! We're at a turn of events. This concerns not only the security – yes, the security – but also the transformation of the economy and society. In addition to digitalisation, the major challenges of the coming years will be the ecological change and the even faster need to exit from fossil energy sources. We will therefore provide additional €4.9 billion for the transformation of the economy and its location in this federal financial framework by 2026 in order to respond effectively to climate change. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] We provide about 220 million euros for projects in the field of green and digital future technologies for the sustainable and innovative transformation of key industries. In addition, EUR 330 million will be added for applied research in future technologies. A total of EUR 1.375 billion will be made available for the transformation of energy-intensive industries as well as for the sustainable security of the industrial site in Austria in subdivided 43, i.e. in the climate protection resort for the years 2023 to 2026. We thus accompany domestic industrial companies on their way to a CO2-free future and at the same time also secure value added and jobs in Austria in the long term. To reduce our dependence on Russian natural gas – an important point – a total of EUR 300 million for gas diversification is planned for the years 2023 to 2025. In 2023, 100 million euros will be budgeted for the promotion of the transport of non-Russian gas to Austria. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Ladies and gentlemen, the challenges of the coming years will become apparent if you look at a few very specific key points from the ressort budgets. If I may start with the Federal Chancellery: The budget of the Federal Chancellery will be increased by 139 million euros by 2026 compared to the current federal financial framework. Of these, EUR 17.9 million is intended for women and equality and will be invested mainly in the protection of violence. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Of course, integration – not least due to the Ukraine war – remains a major challenge and we therefore continue the budget allocation of EUR 107.8 million for this very high level of the previous year. The budget for the family and youth sector is increased by 38.1 million euros compared to the previous year. The first adjustment of family benefits to inflation also leads to an additional disbursement of EUR 253.4 million in 2023. The reduction of service providers' contributions to the Family Compensation Fund brings about 350 million euros to companies. In the field of executives, the last two years have shown us clearly how important it is to be prepared for crises. Our police officers have contributed a great deal to the protection of internal security, and we will increase the budget for crisis prevention measures by EUR 90 million over the next four years. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] In addition, we increase the financial resources to improve protective equipment, deployment technology and equipment for police officers of EUR 121,2 million. With 60 million euros more than in the federal financial framework 2022 to 2025, the acquisition of four transport helicopters is financed. With this, we invest more than 180 million euros in addition to improving, increasing and also modernising Austrian executives. We are not only in the Federal Chancellery, but also in the Ministry of the Interior we are increasing the means of protecting women from violence. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] The appropriations for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be increased by 25.1 million euros next year. Additional financial resources of more than EUR 241.8 million will be made available by 2026. In the field of development cooperation, more €12 million per year will be available from 2023 onwards, which can be used in particular for projects in the priority countries and regions. The increase in human resources of the judicial system also continues with this budget. In the future, an additional 15.1 million euros will be available for the stockpiling and expansion of planning sites each year. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] In total, we will invest EUR 214.9 million in important areas of justice next year. In addition, EUR 49.6 million per year and EUR 44.8 million per year for the implementation of measures and medical care alone will be available. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] In the field of public service and sport, we invest 81.8 million euros in additional resources by 2026 and have also agreed on a substantial increase in funding and sustainable financing of sports. In addition to supporting the wide-ranging and top-notch sports, we also provide funds for major events such as the Alpine Ski World Cup 2025 in Saalbach-Hinterglemm with 8 million euros. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] For the year 2023, payments of 620.2 million euros are planned for the field of art and culture. This corresponds to an increase of 63.1 million euros compared to the previous year. All areas of life – and, of course, art and culture – are heavily affected by high inflation and by inflation. Therefore, concrete relief measures must also be the focus of the use of resources in this area. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] In order to achieve this, for example, the various art and cultural promotions of EUR 15 million were increased to ensure a stable financial framework for the local art and culture scene. In order to combat the shortage of skilled workers, additional EUR 120 million will be made available in the workplace next year. In addition, 300 million euros will be used under the Spring Board programme. In this way, 50 000 long-term unemployed people will be re-integrated into the labour market in 2022 and 2023. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] This will also provide sufficient resources to make an effective labour market policy possible. As part of the care reform, the care profession for new professionals is made more attractive. An annual financial framework of 30 million euros is available for this purpose. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] The current crisis and the forthcoming necessary transformations are a site-related challenge for our economy, for all of us. Therefore, the financial resources of the economic sector will be increased by 1.1 billion euros compared to the previous year's budget and thus by almost 45 percent. In addition to this year's funds, we also provide EUR 2023 850 million for the energy cost grant for the economy. We support the digital and ecological transformation of our bowl industry with an additional 220 million euros by 2026. We want the large international streaming services not only to get subscribers from Austria, but above all also to leave value added with us in the country. Therefore, we will make 142 million euros available for a new incentive system by 2026, in addition to the corresponding new donations for Austrian film productions in the cultural budget. The area of applied research is very important in order to ensure and further enhance the attractiveness of the economic and research location in Austria. In addition, applied research contributes significantly to the transition to new forms of energy in order to ensure a future trading and competitive location. The disbursements for the applied research of the economic resort in 2023 increase to EUR 281.7 million – compared to the previous year, this means a significant increase in the total financial resources of 65 percent. By 2026, i.e. over the entire period of the Federal Financial Framework, a total of EUR 405.7 million is available. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Payments for applied research by the Ministry of Climate Change – to stay in the field – will rise by 42,5 million euros in the coming year to 624,1 million euros. By 2026, a financial increase of EUR 106.2 million can be recorded in the federal financial framework. This will continue to support the transformation of the economy and the transition to new energies. In the field of health, we will provide 1.2 million euros for the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic next year. [[Abg. Belakovich: billions! There's billions standing!]] This should also be used, among other things, for the further financing of the procurement of vaccines and for payments from already implemented pandemic control measures under the Epidemic Act or also the COVID-19 interest rate grant law. The implementation of the discharge measures from the anti-fertilization packages also has an impact on this UG 24, i.e. on health: Extraordinary credits for health insurance contributions from farmers and traders will be provided with a total of 80 million euros. In the area of social and consumer protection, about 775 million euros are available in financial terms compared to the 2022 Federal estimates. The main focus is on the care sector and also on financing the measures in the care reform already mentioned. For example, the EUR 570 million target grants are intended to ensure better payment in care and care professions. In addition, funds will be made available to increase the promotion of 24-hour care with a volume of 16 million euros. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] The education budget has already exceeded the 10 billion euro mark in 2022 and will increase by another billion to 11.25 billion euros next year. We provide 238.1 million euros for the school year 2023 for health protection measures and the fight against the effects of the pandemic on pupils. We all enjoyed his Nobel Prize a few days ago with Prof. Zeilinger. This award is recognition for his years of scientific research; at the same time, he also shows that we must further strengthen basic research in Austria, because no one knows in what field the next groundbreaking discovery comes and whatever applications will be possible. We therefore increase the research budget by a total of EUR 510.3 million in the years 2023 to 2026. This enables us to expand central institutions for basic research and also to implement new programmes and new missions. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] In the field of science and research, payments increase by EUR 302.4 million compared to the previous year to a total of EUR 5.9 billion. For universities, additional funds are also made available annually totalling 250 million euros. In order to relieve students and improve their financial situation, student funding is increased on the one hand and, on the other hand, is evaluated annually. Some 50 000 study aid beneficiaries benefit from this. In the years 2023 to 2026, we take a total of more than 300 million euros into our hands. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] With the provision of funds of 14.8 billion euros by 2026, we are also committed to sustainable financing of climate and environmental protection in Austria in the long term. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Roll.]] Not least, the energy impact of the war in Ukraine has led us to see how important it is to become more independent of Russian gas. To achieve this, 300 million euros are planned for gas diversification by 2025. In order to increase overall energy efficiency, we take control of 190 million euros a year. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] [[Abg. Kassinger: That's nothing, that won't be enough! That's where you get exactly... terawatt hours!]] In the area of mobility, the priorities of the government programme will continue to be consistently implemented. By 2026, the disbursement volume will increase by EUR 1.4 billion, which is an increase of 6.6 percent. [[Intrusion of the Abg. Erasim.]] This will ensure, for example, the financing of the ÖBB Framework Plan, despite rising interest rates, by providing additional EUR 503.9 million by 2026. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] In the field of agriculture and forestry, EUR 270 million will be made available for drinking water supply and wastewater treatment next year. 60 million euros are also budgeted for the protection against natural hazards by 2026. This is very important to reduce the risk of flood damage in spite of increased construction costs. Ladies and gentlemen! Of course, we do not finance all these measures in times of high economy, but in the midst of a crisis that our way of life has also called into question in a sustainable way. [[Intrusion of the Abg. Scrolling]] As the Federal Government, we are setting out the right measures for Austria, for people and also for businesses. We are not only voting against the crisis, we are investing out of it in future opportunities and opportunities and we are also setting targeted priorities that will strengthen us in the long term. We invest in the military, we invest in the economy, but we also invest in the country's social security. That is what people expect of us – not only in difficult times, but now more than ever! Austria should be stronger, more secure and more independent from the crisis – out of responsibility for tomorrow! Thank you."", ""Mr President. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, Appreciated spectators at the gallery, but also at home in front of the devices! [[Abg. Belakovich: What does woman say about the Leyen?]] High house! It is good, right and, above all, important that we talk here today about the challenges of the present and the major issues of the future; and it is especially important that we do it here, here in the House, in Parliament. It has been a lot of talk over the last few days – and I have also talked about it – about what Parliament's role in Austria is in democracy, and I am convinced that: They – as directly elected representatives of the people – are the heart of our democracy, and that is why this discussion must take place today, here and now! [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Especially in times of crisis, this heart is incredibly demanded. Let us think back to the beginning of the pandemic together! Let us remember when there were meetings here in the House on the weekend and decisions have been taken across all party borders to combat the pandemic – at the very beginning, in such a crucial phase! There the whole power of democracy has actually been expressed, and this needs to be done very urgently even now in such challenging times. [[Abg. Worm: The error!]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Belakovich.]] Ladies and gentlemen! I could now talk about why we are in this crisis, since when we are in this crisis, I could point out how many challenges we face in Austria and in Europe. [[Abg. Belakovich: Yes then say it!]] I could speculate how long we still have to work in this crisis mode, including in the government. [[Abg. Erasim: Hopefully not...!]] [[New call of the abg. Belakovich.]] But first of all, I do not have a glass ball, and secondly, ladies and gentlemen, especially from the FPÖ – if you would listen once and not always shout in, then you would also hear what I have to say – I tell you that the problem view alone and pessimism will not bring us anywhere just at a time when we are now experiencing them. [[Interlocutory calls from Mr Belakovich, Mr Deimek and Mr Worm]] [[Call at the FPÖ:This is the problem that you are exactly...!]] [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] [[Abg. Belakovich: That's all...!]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Haven't you seen him?]] Let me stress at this point what is positive: for example, cohesion at European level, which is currently greater than ever; the strength of our country, which we did not have to prove over generations, but which we actually have to show; the resilience of our institutions, including this House, of the Parliament, which you too must demonstrate and demonstrate every day; and the perseverance of the people who are also in demand in the coming weeks and months. [[Abg. Belakovich: Insanity! ...]] [[Abg. Worm: Bite teeth together!]] It is all these components that make up our democracy, cohesion in our society, and also make us stand in challenging times, ladies and gentlemen. [[Abg. Belakovich: Yes, you split up all the time!]] Europe – and also Austria – has already mastered so many things. Even if you look into the history books, you can see that Austria has already passed many tests, that Austria often had to respond flexibly to major challenges. It was only yesterday that the first freely elected German Chancellor of the Second Republic, Leopold Figl, was honoured with a large ceremony in the Federal Chancellor's Office of Karl Nehammer – one who, like hardly anyone else, managed to address the concerns of the people, but also to give hope. [[Abg. Belakovich: This is...!]] And that's exactly what I want to focus on. In recent weeks and months, we have done an incredibly great deal: We have already reduced gas dependence from 80 percent to 50 percent. We have ensured energy security for this winter. Nobody in Austria needs to worry about freezing or that the children's rooms are not warm enough. [[Intervocations at the FPÖ.]] [[Call the ÖVP: Quiet!]] The gas storage is filled to 79 percent, and for the first time, Mrs Deputies of the FPÖ, we have also set up a strategic gas reserve which has not been available before, and we have achieved this together as a government, as a parliament and as a society. [[Abg. Belakovich: Do you know how many people already sit in the cold apartments because they can't afford it?]] [[Abg. Belakovich: But no one can afford it!]] [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] I do not hide that we have been facing crises since the start of this government, just after our fishing observation. [[Abg. Hafenecker: You're the crisis!]] We can do this now, too, because, with Karl Nehammer, we have a crisis manager who makes this possible, because we have a vice-president, also a Federal Minister Leonore Wiessler, who daily provides energy security. [[Abg. Belakovich: Where is it at all?]] I trust to say, Mr. Vice-Chancellor, that Leonore Wiessler, with her broad portfolio, probably would not have thought that energy would be their main focus this year. [[Abg. Belakovich:... Parliament, deliberately with the untruth...!]] We have a Finance Minister, who is working daily to ensure that there is relief for people – in the short term, but also in the medium and long term, with the historical abolition of cold progression. [[Call the SPÖ: vouchers!]] You have to keep that in mind! Generations of governments have tried it or wanted to try it, we have actually achieved it now. [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] And, of course, we have a Federal Minister Martin Kocher, who is working with his team every day to obtain jobs to ensure that companies can continue to operate in order to maintain prosperity in Austria. I can also make my contribution, and I also try to find alliances at European level for further and better solutions. Yes, I know that a few in this House do not want to take note of the fact that we can only create some things if we move on to a European line, but that is exactly what will and must be the solution. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Despite the many crises, which have also been unplanned by this government, I would like to say that we have already implemented almost half of the projects required in the government agreement and in the programme. We have put in place essential measures to maintain exactly what is referred to in the title of today's declaration of government, namely security and prosperity. Think back: the eco-social tax reform, a huge discharge in billions, also in terms of climate protection and the environment and the next generations. We have launched the biggest care reform for decades, a subject that will probably affect everyone in this society sooner or later. And we have also shown with the climate ticket that climate awareness and mobility are no longer a contradiction. We are doing this out of responsibility for Austria, and this responsibility, ladies and gentlemen, together with us all. We wouldn't do it alone. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] We are training them together, and these are not simple times, but we should also remember that we have this great task, both with force of action and with mutual respect, in front of each other. It sometimes depends on how the sound is – as you say so beautifully: the sound makes the music – and I would just like us to be more respectful with each other, to involve all those who sit here, stand, talk, or even make intermediate calls pass over them. I understand everyone who is worried about this outside, who is worried when Putin continues to escalate his language and when he threatens with nuclear weapons. I understand everyone who is worried because he does not know how to finance the next purchase or pay the fuel filling, and I know many entrepreneurs who, due to increased energy costs, are really fighting to maintain their operations. [[Intrusion of the Abg. Belakovich]] [[Abg. Kickl: That's perfect for the CO2 tax! It's a good match!]] [[Abg. Belakovich: Is incredible!]] [[Abg. Kickl: Full understanding: CO2 tax! Pass!]] For this very reason, as the Federal Government, we are doing everything we can to counter this trend to the best possible extent. [[Abg. Belakovich:..., super! You've introduced CO2 tax, exactly!]] [[Abg. Kickl: Just last weekend! Everything done!]] [[Abg. Belakovich: On Saturday: CO2 tax!]] My Dear Ones Ladies and gentlemen, in all the criticisms that must always have place in a democracy, whether it is entitled or whether it is overlaid, one cannot be accused of this federal government: [[Abg. Belakovich: CO2 tax,...!]] [[Abg. Belakovich: No, CO2 tax is not entitled!]] [[Abg. Deimek: CO2 tax is cynical!]] Inaction. [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] I would like to refer to the measures already taken: Already in January of this year, the first anti-trusion package has been adopted. [[Abg. Belakovich: You didn’t feel that!]] I would like to point out that this was before the Russian attack war on Ukraine. Then there were a number of measures, which have also been effective in the short term, for example, EUR 300 for groups particularly affected, single-parents, minimum pensioners, 500 euros for each and every – if they have not yet arrived everywhere – then this will be the case in Bälden –, EUR 180 special family aid, which has already been paid in August, we have preferred the increase in the family bonus, and ultimately the power-cost brake, in respect of which economists also now prove that it will probably lead to a reduction in inflation in the first quarter of 2023. [[Abg. Kickl: They already have it in prison!]] All of these are measures that work in the short term, and in addition, measures are also being put in place to demonstrate long-term impact, such as the abolition of cold progression, which I have already mentioned, the valorisation of social benefits and also the reduction of additional labour costs. A comprehensive package for the relief of entrepreneurs has just been presented – this is also so important that the prosperity we all want to maintain can actually be guaranteed. This current package has a volume of 1.3 billion euros. Ladies and gentlemen! This federal government does not let anyone down, neither individuals nor entrepreneurs, and I can assure you that we are working 24 hours a week, seven days a week to relieve you and get through this crisis. [[Cheerfulness of the Abg. Belakovich]] [[Abg. Belakovich: Please don't like that. I don't think so.]] [[Congratulations on ÖVP and Greens.]] Austria is a pioneer when it comes to taking action and burdening people. [[Abg. Belakovich: CO2 discharge, yes, great discharge!]] You can also take note of this – you don't have to see how I look at the FPÖs – but it's also clear: If you expect – and people rightly expect this – to respond quickly and provide rapid help, and at the same time assume that everything is 100% correct, then you haven't experienced life yet. 100 percent is as good as nowhere, and therefore, I think, we should not stop seeing only the mistakes and the small maladies, but actually focus on what has worked. [[Abg. Kickl: Only when you analyze everything is 100 percent right!]] We are putting all the levers in motion to meet these challenges together, and we need even better solutions at European level – Mr Vice-Chancellor has already mentioned it –: We need a decoupling of electricity and gas prices, so that the energy price finally goes down. [[Ah-Rufe at the SPÖ]] [[Abg. Lightness: Aha? Ah! After a year!]] We cannot do it without intervention in the market – and I also say this in full awareness that a year ago, that is, before the turn of the era, we were still pleading for it, if possible, not to intervene in the market. [[Call the SPÖ:Go?]] [[Abg. Lightenness: And why was Mrs. Geessler always against it in Brussels?]] That's where I speak for the position of the ÖVP. However, we have seen that the market is not self-regulated at present. [[Ah-and-oh call at the SPÖ.]] There are erroneous price developments, and they must be met. [[Abg. Einwallner: New knowledge today!]] I hear approvals from the SPÖs. Yes, there was already a first step at the Council of EU Energy Ministers last Friday – it was, by the way, a special Council. [[Abg. Lightenness: If the ÖVP could still convince the Greens, it would be good! If we could still convince the Greens!]] The first steps were taken there: the withdrawal of overconsumption, a solidar charge, and also the reduction of electricity consumption at peak times must be included in the calculation. [[Call the SPÖ:Since March we say that!]] [[Abg. Lightness: Since February actually!]] But I also say to you: That's just a first step. Further steps must be taken, because à la longue must be promoted to promote the gas used for electricity generation so that it also has a sustainable impact on the energy market as a whole. [[Abg. Kassinger: Understanding: Symptom control for problems that you have created yourself! You're turning around in the circle!]] [[Congratulations with the ÖVP and MEPs of the Greens.]] [[Abg. Lightenness: I don't think the greens are convinced yet! They don't clap!]] I will not only work for this, as a Minister of Europe, but I am also currently working together with Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer to find alliances in Europe so that we can actually bring about quick solutions, because: [[Abg. Lighten: Where is it at all?]] We'll come over winter, but there's a time after winter, there's a next winter, there's also a fall 2023, and we want to be ready. [[Abg. Lightenness: This is longer now than Mr Kogler!]] [[Call:New elections would be important]] I'm already coming to my closing apple, and it might surprise you – or not –: [[Abg. Belakovich: Thank God!]] I know that with all the measures we have taken – and I am quite clear to you that these measures could fill many declarations of government, which you can measure by the time dimension of our speeches – not all problems have been solved. [[Abg. Kickl: Just take your time!]] [[Intrusion of the Abg. Hafenecker]] I know, however, that we will do everything we can to continue to guarantee prosperity and security in Austria, and I can only ask you that you, as decision-makers of the Republic of Austria, also help with this, I can invite you that we together, united and hand-in-hand, shape the future of Austria and Europe. Let us not make the mistake of splitting ourselves apart, not as a society, not as a member of this House, not as a government, not as Austria, nor as a Europe! [[Call to the FPÖ:You divided the society!]] Let's go hand in hand to deal with these problems! Let's listen and try to find solutions! No one has yet found the solution by which everything is solved with a stroke, but I am convinced: Together, with a strong heart in democracy, we can find these solutions! I'll invite you to that.""]","<|system|>

It made the point clearly that the threads of EU environmental policy are woven through many aspects of the UK’s relationship with the EU. Not only did environmental policy play little part in the referendum campaign; I would hazard that no one made the environmental case for leaving the EU. However, I am glad that the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, stressed that we must have the confidence to press ahead The report is not a very comfortable read. In every aspect of withdrawal from the EU that the committee considered, the challenges and pitfalls remain as daunting as initially feared. Since Britain was branded as the dirty man of Europe, participation in the EU has produced a comprehensive framework that Britain has embraced and improved upon to bring about favourable environmental impacts across our daily lives. Leaving the EU will affect nearly every aspect of the UK’s environmental policy. That interdependence was highlighted by my noble friend Lord Judd, who asked several questions about what practical arrangements will come forward What is clear is that two years to resolve these daunting challenges is not very long if we are to provide answers on future policy direction and resources. It is also clear that Defra has had nearly nine months since the referendum and has not really laid out its thinking and approach to the task—other than to promise the great repeal Bill and underline certain fundamental basics, such as that the UK’s climate goals have not changed. The Secretary of State has explained that her department has eight different work-streams in its EU exit programme and is carrying out detailed analysis, ranging from market access and labour to trade and agricultural land use policy. She has also promised two Green Papers, on the future of food and farming and on the environment Perhaps the Minister can move forward from this position tonight and clarify at the outset the progress of this mapping exercise, when it will be finalised and whether it will be published. Has Defra been given the resources to deliver this and follow it through, with all its legislative implications, given that its budget was slashed by 30% by the previous Chancellor and it has been tasked with finding further savings of 15% by 2020? Has the Minister made any further request to the Treasury, beyond the meagre recruitment of 30 new posts If I have any criticism of the report, it is that it has been light on two important points: agriculture and climate change. However, I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, said that agriculture will be the subject of a separate report, while the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, also referred to the interrelationship between farming and the environment. Paragraph 24 of the report mentions agriculture and fisheries in relation to the substantial environmental elements and significant cash-flow expenditure, signified in one bullet point in box 2 at paragraph 18. I draw attention to the significant role farming plays in managing the environment. After all, it has to look after its land resource for future generations. I declare my interest in a dairy enterprise in Cheshire which is in receipt of EU funds Agriculture is best placed to cherish the landscape and implement national priorities. The noble Baroness, Lady McIntosh, raised the importance of countryside stewardship in this regard. To do this, however, agriculture must be profitable. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has come forward with its industrial strategy, which was recently debated in your Lordships’ House. Yet in that strategy document, there is no mention of agriculture. Can the Minister underline tonight the Government’s commitment, beyond the statement that there is rural-proofing across all government departments I would also mention the importance of better regulation—not to be confused with deregulation—which will need to be constantly under consideration. My noble friend Lord Hunt spoke about all the organisations that need to co-ordinate and maintain standards through better regulation, while the noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, also spoke strongly on regulation, especially in regard to energy considerations I mentioned that agriculture must be profitable, and I need not remind the Minister that much of agriculture would become uneconomic without subsidy. The Government have not yet come forward with proposals for funding agriculture post-exit, around 2019, a point underlined by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leeds. This will be fundamental to food policy, the food chain and the food industry, which accounts for 6.8% of GVA and is the UK’s fourth-largest exporting sector. Funding and food prices are intrinsically linked. Volatility in finance and extreme weather patterns were the subject of an interesting Global Food Security report on the resilience of the global food system and environmental tipping points. I was interested in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, given his perspective as chair of the adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change. At the heart of the EU’s environmental policy is the precautionary principle. When this is repatriated into UK law, the Government will face the challenge of whether it is to remain hazard-based or become risk-based. On this will depend the outcome of the great royal debate about whether the genetic modification of organisms will be permitted. This will have a significant impact on the environment regarding what sprays will be permitted and whether they can be incorporated into seed to save the environment altogether I underline the critical importance of climate change and its impact. Although it is mentioned in chapter 6 of the report, it is only really examined in paragraphs 134 and 135 with regard to the EU ETS. While the report is correct to underline that climate change is a global issue that transcends the EU and that the UK is a party to international agreements, the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, will appreciate that there are doubts about whether the UK is on track to meet the sixth carbon budget and the EU renewables energy directive, which requires the UK to reach an overall target that includes transport and heat as well as electricity. The noble Lord, Lord Krebs, and the noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, also spoke eloquently on the challenges. The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and the noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, will remember that it proved extremely difficult to get the Government to set a decarbonisation target for 2030 The debate this afternoon has highlighted the many concerns raised in the report. The Minister will know that there is widespread concern about the process of consolidation into the great repeal Bill. The House of Commons Library has identified 922 agriculture, 1,122 fisheries and 527 environmental instruments, regulations and laws which will need to be consolidated. Two questions arise. First, how will the Government define what is practical and appropriate and will this test be applied separately to each regulation? Several speakers have drawn attention to this in the debate. Secondly, as Labour has continually emphasised, the great repeal Bill is not a substitute for proper accountability and scrutiny, so will the Government commit to provide draft versions of the Bill as negotiations progress, so that we can be assured that current levels of environmental protection are at least being maintained The determination to pin the Government down on this issue sadly arises because they have not always lived up to their rhetoric on environmental issues. Their mantra is that they will leave the environment in better shape than they found it, but on issues such as air quality, they have failed to act, despite two court judgments. As a result, people being forced to breathe dirty air has led to an estimated 40,000 early deaths. The UK is still expected to have illegally high nitrogen dioxide levels in many areas in 2020. The Government still have some convincing to do regarding their real commitment to environmental improvements. Leaving the EU could give Ministers leeway to set more lenient targets Our second area of concern is the weakening of enforcement mechanisms in UK law. Currently, as the report identifies, the EU Commission enforces the environmental legislation through its many functions, including by monitoring progress, providing guidance and interpreting legislation. A whole range of accountability mechanisms are potentially at risk as we leave the EU. Historically, both the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union have had a strong impact in ensuring the UK’s compliance with EU legislation that affects environmental protection. Earlier this week, the Environment Agency brought a successful prosecution through Aylesbury Crown Court against Thames Water, resulting in a record fine of £20 million for six pollution incidents. Can the Minister say whether this sets any precedents for dealing with more general environmental issues? More importantly, will the Government, who are sometimes at fault rather than a company, face a similar course of action if they fail to meet their responsibilities? Does the Minister accept that the Government will need additional enforcement mechanisms to fill the gap left by the Commission? Does he accept that a clear framework has to be set while negotiations are ongoing to ensure that the UK’s environmental standards are maintained The effectiveness of the EU regulatory regime is due in no small part to the deterrent effect of the power of the EU institutions to hold member states to account and to levy fines for non-compliance. In addition, every year, Defra faces challenges of disallowance and even infraction should it not implement the policies correctly. An effective and independent domestic mechanism will be necessary to ensure compliance by government, public authorities and farmers in undertaking their environmental obligations. The noble Baroness, Lady Sheehan, underlined these concerns in her remarks, which were echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Trees Our third concern is the future funding of environmental and climate change initiatives and institutions. Although the Government have committed to continuing research funding until 2020, this is a short-term commitment in research planning terms, and so far there has been less of a guarantee of continued funding beyond 2019 for other crucial projects. There is a real danger that bids for government funding post Brexit will be competing for a shrinking pot and that the environment will not be deemed to be a priority. There is a real concern that Defra will not have a seat at the top table when some of these difficult choices are being made. I hope the Minister can confirm that Defra will establish clear objectives for future environmental protection in the UK and will be determined and committed to delivering the level of resources necessary to deliver this. The noble Lord, Lord Rees, made a powerful speech on the Copernicus programme and the UK’s continuing participation in it Fourthly, the report identifies the complexities of managing future environmental planning in the context of the devolved Administrations within the UK. Currently, there are differences in environmental and climate change policies between them: for example the Administrations have either legislated their own climate change targets or created their own Act. This difference is likely to increase once we have officially left the EU, and the requirement to act in conformity with EU law is lifted. It is therefore vital that the devolved Administrations and the Government should achieve an appropriate level of policy co-ordination, while still allowing for some distinction to reflect local or regional circumstances. Can the Minister reassure us of the department’s intentions to meet with the devolved bodies frequently during the Brexit negotiations to ensure that the demands of each devolved Administration are properly reflected Finally—your Lordships will be glad I have said that word at this late time, and I am sorry I have taken so long—it is crucial that we have a coherent plan to combat climate change once we leave the EU. Up till now, the UK’s contribution to the global debate has predominantly been as an EU member, and historically the EU has provided leadership in shaping the mechanisms that it has introduced to meet collective targets. The report rightly recognised that we will lose our place in the EU negotiating team, and we run the risk of being sidelined unless we can ally with a new bloc Several questions arise as the UK will no longer be required to meet all the EU’s targets for renewable energy. Once outside the EU, the UK will not be compelled to report to it on its annual emissions or to submit plans to the EU for corrective action if the UK misses the 2020 targets for reducing emissions. The withdrawal process will need to establish the UK’s obligations under international law, separate from the EU. Can the Minister outline what the Government’s intentions are in this respect The election of President Trump has raised the stakes on this issue. The noble Lord, Lord Rees, has argued that the UK needs to find a way to play a continuing role of influence. While the US Administration have yet to provide clear policies on climate change, the President has threatened to remove the US from all international climate treaties. This puts a renewed onus on the UK to set out clear policies and be a leader in combating climate change. I would be most grateful if the Minister could outline how the Government intend to respond to this challenge This has been a very well-informed debate. It has highlighted the importance of certainty and consistency for institutions, businesses and investors. It is clear that there is a great deal of interest in the progress of discussions both inside and outside this House. Parliament will want to continue to play its part in shaping the outcome. I hope the Minister is able to confirm that all sides of the House will have a full and meaningful role as negotiations commence. I look forward to hearing how he thinks this will best be achieved.', 'My Lords, I declare my farming interests as set out in the register. Although this is a debate about the environment, agriculture clearly comes into it very strongly I join your Lordships in expressing gratitude to the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, for raising these important issues for debate. It has been a very thought-provoking debate, and I have listened carefully. I do not think that there were 93 questions, but I fear that I shall not be able to satisfy your Lordships as to all the numerous questions. I shall, of course, write in full after the debate My department leads on environment and climate change adaptation policy, and works closely with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, which has lead responsibility for climate policy generally. From the outset, I want to set out the Government’s stance on the future of environmental policy. We are committed, irrespective of the result of the EU referendum, to delivering the environmental outcome laid out in our manifesto—to be the first generation to leave the natural environment of England in a better state than we found it. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, that we want to enhance not maintain it—we want to go beyond that—which is why we are developing a 25-year environment plan to deliver this. This plan will be key to informing our approach to environmental policy in the longer term. I am very pleased that my noble friend Lord Selborne rightly emphasised the work of the Natural Capital Committee Following the decision to leave the EU, we have the opportunity to widen the scope of the environment plan and design an approach and supporting regulation that are tailored for our country. That is something very much that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, sought to tease out in her questions. We have started conversations with stakeholders to understand views on opportunities for Defra policy outside the EU. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State is holding stakeholder meetings on farming and horticulture, fisheries, food and drink and the environment. The plan will set the direction for all our more detailed environmental policies and plans, and there will be full consultation with the Natural Capital Committee. Defra will continue to engage with the full breadth of stakeholders. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, referred to charities and civil society; we shall, of course, engage with all at official ministerial level As noble Lords have said, three-quarters of our landmass is farmed, and how we manage our farmland is key to tackling some of the environmental challenges. The 25-year environment plan will be developed to dovetail and sit alongside the 25-year food and farming plan. This was something that I think the noble Baronesses, Lady Young, Lady Miller and Lady Parminter, all raised. Again, I think that all of us recognise that the two plans need to work together to show how agriculture can contribute to our natural environment and, at the same time, be increasingly productive and provide good-quality, high-standard food for our country and to export We need to make sure that even more people are better connected to the environment and that everyone has the chance to appreciate the wonders of our country. We need to take account of our natural systems, such as river catchments, and landscapes. Local communities have an intrinsic role and are often best placed to secure the best outcomes for the environment. This engagement with local communities will allow everyone to understand better how agriculture and land management can work in harmony with improving our environment and, for instance, coping with flood risk. We want our water and seas to be cleaner, our air to be of better quality, our plants and wildlife to be healthier and our land to be better managed. We want to invest in woodland planting and peatland restoration, which will contribute towards achieving carbon targets as well as improving water quality, flood mitigation, biodiversity and recreation. To make this a reality, we will publish an environment framework shortly, which will start off a period of public engagement to help shape the 25-year environment plan. We aim to publish the full plan in 2017 The UK has a long tradition of protecting the environment, which indeed pre-dates our accession to the EU—we have the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, the Protection of Birds Act 1954 and the Clean Air Act 1956. We have recently taken action independently of the EU with, for instance, the expansion of two national parks and we have announced plans to ban the sale and manufacture of cosmetics and personal care products containing microbeads. I was very taken by what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, said about the coastline—only yesterday I was talking to the Marine Conservation Society about the important work that it does with volunteers to help clean up our coastlines We have already achieved some success—I think my noble friend Lord Selborne referred to this. Our rivers, beaches and air are cleaner than they were 50 years ago, household recycling levels have quadrupled in the last 15 years, tree cover has increased to its highest level in 600 years and 63% of our protected habitats have been restored. We have also seen the recovery of some species such as the lesser horseshoe bat and birds such as the tree sparrow, cirl bunting and stone curlew. The 5p plastic bag charge introduced last year has already led to 6 billion fewer bags being handed out. But I am the first to say that, of course, more needs to be done. My noble friend Lord Selborne mentioned soil health, which is vital for food production and the state of the welfare of the planet A number of your Lordships, including the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, quite rightly mentioned sustainable fisheries. I very much remember the debate that was introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady Scott of Needham Market, about the North Sea. I am sorry if I was not quite as buoyant as her description suggested, but I felt very strongly about the important work on sustainable fisheries, and indeed what is starting to come out from that work, which is that—as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, referred to—there are some success stories. We must look positively at the opportunities. There are lessons to be learned about what has happened in the North Sea in terms of sustainable fisheries and also about what has not worked. I was pleased to hear more from your Lordships on that. Of course, what we want from our fisheries policy is a more financially self-sufficient, profitable and responsive UK seafood sector. We also want to deliver a cleaner, healthier and more productive marine environment. Those two must go hand in hand We also have an ambitious manifesto commitment to plant a further 11 million trees. I join the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, in admitting that I love trees. I think that they are absolutely essential to our lives—I have indeed planted a few myself. I was pleased also that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, mentioned agro-forestry and its importance. I very much enjoyed the visit I had yesterday; it was really interesting We also need to do more to tackle invasive non-native species. As the Minister responsible for biosecurity, among other matters, I assure your Lordships that I am very strongly of the view that we need to help our environment in that regard We take air pollution seriously and are committed to improving air quality. Our national air quality plan for nitrogen dioxide, published last December, sets out a comprehensive approach for achieving compliance in the shortest possible time, including the introduction of clean air zones. We will have opportunities through the 25-year environment plan to strengthen integrated planning at river catchment level. My noble friend Lord Selborne mentioned river catchment levels and a number of your Lordships mentioned the need for integration. That is absolutely clear and we must do that The decision to leave the European Union means that we have to consider how we achieve our long-term vision to be the first generation to leave the natural environment in a better state. It is an opportunity to design an outcome-focused regulatory framework, one which is effective, efficient, tailor-made and—I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter—evidence based, to ensure that it is right for the needs of our country The desire for certainty around what Brexit means for our regulatory and legislative framework is, of course, well understood. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, confirmed that the Prime Minister announced earlier this month our plans for a repeal Bill that will convert current EU law into domestic British law. We will also continue to honour our obligations contained in the numerous multilateral environmental agreements reached as a result of global action on environmental protection which the UK is a party to in its own right. I hope that is some reassurance to the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch The UK has already played a central role in securing a global agreement to bear down on the use of hydrofluorocarbon greenhouse gases over the next three decades. The agreement, secured only last week in negotiations under the United Nations Montreal protocol, is estimated to reduce cumulative emissions by the equivalent of between 60 billion and 70 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050 Climate change remains one of the most serious long-term risks to the planet. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, explained that in his usual way. I am afraid that I could not begin to deal with the 93 further questions, but I will make sure that I look at those more thoroughly and digest them before I next meet him. The Government’s commitment to tackling climate change is as strong as ever We should all be proud of the role played by the UK’s negotiators and the leadership shown by my right honourable friend Amber Rudd, as former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, during the Paris conference. The comments of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, about our civil servants and negotiators were absolutely right. My right honourable friend played a crucial role in building alliances, facilitating discussions on climate finance and brokering arrangements on pre-2020 ambition. Therefore, I hope the noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, will accept that those were actions and not words. This was crucial to securing a successful deal The Paris agreement is a significant step forward, with 195 countries committing for the first time to take action to keep the average global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels, pursue efforts towards a 1.5 degree centigrade figure and work towards a long-term goal of net zero emissions in the second half of this century. The noble Lord, Lord Giddens, asked me about our own commitment to that. The UK has started domestic procedures to enable ratification of the agreement and will complete these before the end of the year We are fully committed to the global climate deal agreed in Paris and, in demonstration of that commitment, we have started the domestic procedures. Indeed, we are already playing our part in delivering the Paris agreement through our domestic climate framework set out in the Climate Change Act 2008. Under the Act, the UK was the first country to introduce legally binding emission reduction targets. We remain committed to meeting the Act’s target to reduce UK emissions by at least 80% on 1990 levels by 2050, and adhering to the interim carbon budgets set out under the Act We have already made great progress. Provisional statistics indicate that UK emissions in 2015 were 38% lower than in 1990. Consistent with our commitment to the Act, in July, the Government set the fifth carbon budget in line with the recommendation of our independent advisers, the Committee on Climate Change. As a result of our strong domestic stance, the Climate Action Network rates us as second only to Denmark in taking action against climate change We are now looking ahead to our emissions reduction plan, which will set out how we will cut our emissions through the 2020s. This will form an important signal to the markets, businesses and investors. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, and other noble Lords mentioned the importance of signalling to markets and investors in business. We want to invest the time now to undertake the preparatory work necessary to ensure that we get this right. This will, of course, include engaging across businesses, industry and other stakeholders, on the shared challenge of moving to a low-carbon economy Looking to the future, the decision of the British people to leave the EU does not mean that we will step back from our international leadership against climate change. I know that this is of considerable concern to many of your Lordships who have spoken today. The key role the UK played in securing two recent major global climate agreements—one to combat aviation emissions at the assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the other to phase down the production and use of hydrofluorocarbons under the Montreal protocol—evidences this fact. I hope, again, that the noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, will accept that this is action, and not just words. Our relationships with the US, China, India, Japan and other European countries will stand us in good stead as we deliver on the promises made in Paris Domestically, we are preparing for the impacts of climate change, including the increased threat of extreme weather and flooding, working on a five-year cycle of assessment, action and review underpinned by the Climate Change Act. Adaptation is integrated across the policies and programmes of Government. Departments work closely together—as I know myself, with responsibility for the climate change adaptation sub-committee—to increase the nation’s resilience to climate change, using the first ever national adaptation programme as a common framework. Over the past few years, that adaptation sub-committee, under the exceptional leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, has made great strides in improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change. In 2015, that sub-committee published its first independent assessment of the progress being made. In July this year, the sub-committee published a comprehensive report for the second climate change risk assessment. This has provided a detailed assessment of those risks that are the most immediate priorities for action, and will form the basis of the Government’s climate change risk assessment that we will publish in January and which will underpin our next national adaptation programme due in 2018 Internationally, we continue to support countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change as well as enabling them to take action to reduce their emissions. Last year, we committed to provide at least £5.8 billion of international climate finance over the next five years, as well as continuing to mobilise funds from a variety of sources The noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, asked about climate change ambition and consumer confidence. The Government are committed to tackling climate change. As I said, domestic legislation is supported across the political spectrum and is unaffected by the results of the referendum. As I also said, in July, the Government set out the fifth carbon budget, and our emission reduction programme will outline our plans to meet our targets The environment plan framework will be published shortly and there will be a period of consultation. I will ensure that your Lordships are all sent the documents when they have been published, and I very much encourage and look forward to responses. I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, that it has always been the Government’s intention that Parliament should be engaged throughout the process that has been described today. There is of course, as I think she concedes, a balance to be struck between transparency and good negotiating practice. I can assure your Lordships, and in particular the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, and his committee, that I know that they are undertaking important work and I very much welcome the opportunity for them to feed the results of their work into our policy development We have had some interesting exchanges today. As a representative of Defra in this House I very much want to assure your Lordships that I will always be available, both inside and outside this House. I want the issues that have been debated today to be current for me; therefore I welcome regular dialogue. They require our utmost attention. I conclude by assuring your Lordships of the resolve of all my ministerial colleagues, as well as myself, to secure an objective which we all share—that is good—which is that we want a better environment for all.', 'My Lords, I declare my interests as set out in the register. I am delighted to commence Second Reading. As we progress with the Bill’s passage, I will be assisted by my noble friend Lady Bloomfield of Hinton Waldrist and I am very grateful to her for all her support so far. It is an enormously important Bill that will deliver meaningful change for our environment and support our goals to achieve net-zero emissions, stem the loss of our precious species and their habitats, and reduce the impacts of pollution 2021 is a “super year” for nature, a turning point. Through the COP 26 UN Climate Change Conference, the Convention on Biological Diversity in Kunming, and the upcoming G7 leaders’ summit, the UK has both the opportunity and responsibility to provide world leadership. The Bill is an important part of demonstrating that leadership The Bill sets a new and ambitious domestic framework for environmental governance as we maximise the opportunities created by leaving the European Union. It will give the Secretary of State a power to set long-term, legally binding environmental targets of at least 15 years. The Bill’s framework allows for long-term targets to be set on any aspect of the natural environment or people’s enjoyment of it. However, it requires the Government to set and achieve at least one target in four priority areas: air quality, biodiversity, water, resource efficiency and waste reduction, as well as a target for fine particulate matter or PM2.5 These targets will be set following a robust, evidence-led process that will include seeking independent expert advice, a role for stakeholders and the public, as well as scrutiny from Parliament. They will build on progress towards achieving the long-term vision of the 25-year environment plan, complement our net-zero target and help tackle some of the serious challenges that remain. We are also tabling an amendment to require a historic, new legally binding target on species abundance in England for 2030, aiming to halt the decline of nature. This world-leading measure will do for nature what our net-zero target is doing for emissions. It will spur action across government and across society on the scale required to address the biodiversity crisis The new independent office for environmental protection will hold us to account in ensuring that these targets, and all environmental law obligations on public authorities, are met. The OEP’s principal objective will be to contribute to environmental protection and the improvement of the natural environment. It will provide the necessary oversight to support long-term environmental governance. The OEP, chaired by the highly respected Dame Glenys Stacey, will independently monitor the way public authorities implement environmental law. Her appointment is a huge win for the OEP; she is a strong voice for the environment and will not shy away from holding this Government, or indeed any Government, to account. The OEP will track and report on progress on environmental improvement plans and targets. It will also receive and investigate complaints on serious breaches of environmental law by public authorities, taking legal action where necessary. On that note, I thank the noble Lords, Lord Krebs and Lord Anderson of Ipswich, in particular for our detailed conversations already on this matter Clearly, the environment must transcend the work of Defra alone. That is why we are embedding internationally recognised environmental principles into domestic law. These principles include the integration, prevention, and precautionary principles, as well as the rectification at source principle and the polluter pays principle. Policymakers across government, from the Department for Work and Pensions to the Department for Transport, will be legally obliged through a statutory policy statement to consider these principles in all policy development where it affects the environment. This is a serious innovation in how the Government make policy The resources and waste measures in the Bill will move us away from a “take, make, throw” model to a more circular economy that keeps materials in use for longer. Measures in the Bill will act across the product life cycle so that we can become a world leader in using resources efficiently. The Government will not only ensure that producers are paying the full costs of the waste they create through extended producer responsibility, but empower our citizens to make more sustainable choices, with clearer product information through material efficiency and eco-labelling, in addition to a more consistent recycling system that is common to every local authority We will provide for more effective enforcement against litter and fly-tipping. We have also taken powers to act on our manifesto commitment to ban the export of plastics to non-OECD countries. These measures combined will have tangible impacts on citizens and our economy, ensuring that the Government are reducing the impact of consumption on our planet. I thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Parminter and Lady Bakewell of Hardington Mandeville, for their interest in these matters particularly The Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to amend REACH regulation, including the REACH Enforcement Regulations 2008. Effective regulation of chemicals is essential for the protection of human health and the environment. The UK is a world leader in the management and regulation of chemicals; that does not change now that we have left the European Union. This power will ensure that legislation can keep up to date with and respond to emerging needs or ambitions for the management of chemicals. We will build on our global reputation and continue to provide a strong and influential voice on the world stage as an active party to the four UN conventions on chemicals and waste. We will continue our work to improve regulation, strengthening the evidence base and ambition globally. The intention is to make sure that we have the means to keep REACH fit for purpose. We are learning more and more about the damage that poor air quality does to human health, including from knowledgeable advocates in this House. I was pleased to meet the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, a couple of weeks ago to hear more about this issue from her. The Bill will require the Secretary of State to set at least two legally binding targets on air quality. This will include a concentration limit for fine particulate matter—the most damaging pollutant to human health—and a more sophisticated population exposure reduction target. Last year, we set out our plans for the long-term PM2.5 target to drive continuous improvement through reductions in exposure to pollution for all citizens irrespective of whether future statutory limits have already been achieved. We will set out further detail on this world-leading approach to air quality in due course, including through public consultation. The new powers in this Bill, alongside the existing legal framework for air quality, build on the £3.8 billion we have already invested in action to tackle air pollution In a changing climate we need additional tools to help us to manage our precious water resources. Modernised legislation will secure a long-term, resilient water supply and sewerage services. This will include powers to direct water companies to work together to meet current and future demand for water. Planning will be more robust; it will ensure that water companies are better able to maintain water supplies and support Defra’s broader efforts to address flooding. We will also strengthen our powers to vary or revoke abstraction licences where these cause environmental damage. These powers will be available from 2028 after our current abstraction plan is fully implemented by 2027. Through the plan, we are collaborating with stakeholders now to achieve sustainable abstraction I am also pleased to announce that the Government will be tabling amendments to the Bill in Committee to help to reduce the harm from storm overflows to our rivers, waterways and coastlines. A significant amount of work has gone into this and I thank the right honourable Member for Ludlow, Philip Dunne, in the other place for his work on this hugely important issue Many noble Lords share my passion for our natural world, and the nature part of the Bill is full of innovative measures to support our ambitions for a green recovery. I mentioned already how our collective appreciation for nature has increased over the course of the pandemic. Many have discovered new corners of refuge in our local green spaces, and the Government want to ensure that local communities can share these green spaces with the wildlife which calls these valuable habitats their homes. Biodiversity net gain will be mandated in the planning system, ensuring that developments such as new homes are not built at the expense of nature, and creating thriving natural spaces for communities. These will require a 10% net improvement in biodiversity, guaranteeing that richer natural spaces will come with new developments Local nature recovery strategies will create strong local leadership to support nature recovery. They will identify priorities and map opportunities for conserving and enhancing nature, helping to ensure that our investments will have the maximum benefit. Local nature recovery strategies will form the foundation of an England-wide nature recovery network. To complement these new tools for nature, we are amending the biodiversity duty in the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act, following post-legislative scrutiny by a Select Committee of this House, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington. This strengthened duty will require an active process of improvement to conserve and enhance nature, rather than merely maintain the status quo The Government have also amended the Bill in the other place to provide for powers to amend the habitats regulations. This will enable us to focus our conservation efforts on our new domestic framework, developed as part of this Bill, while ensuring that we continue to fulfil our international obligations under multilateral environmental agreements such as the Bern convention. Our forthcoming Green Paper will explore how we can deliver this as part of our ambition to halt the decline of nature and protect 30% of our land by 2030. The paper will also consider measures to improve the status of native species such as the hedgehog, water voles and red squirrels These measures will collectively underpin the delivery of a new legally binding target on species abundance for 2030, which I mentioned earlier and will table in Committee, aiming to halt the decline of species. This will put our ambition for the recovery of nature on a par with our net-zero ambition I thank my noble friend Lord Randall of Uxbridge and the right reverend Prelates the Bishop of Manchester, the Bishop of Chichester, the Bishop of Oxford and the Bishop of Salisbury, as well as the Bishop of Norwich and others whom I met recently, for their valuable contributions on this issue. These new amendments will be complemented by actions set out in our recently published England tree and peat action plans, on which I thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Young of Old Scone and Lady Jones of Whitchurch, for their useful insights The Government are working hard to ensure that we tackle biodiversity loss at home, but we are also taking action abroad to protect the world’s most precious and significant forests. We are the first country in the world to introduce legislation to prohibit regulated businesses from using agricultural commodities that have been cultivated on land that was illegally occupied or used. Over 90% of deforestation is illegal in some of the world’s most important forests, such as the Amazon I am aware of the anticipation surrounding the Bill, and, while its passage has been delayed due to exceptional circumstances, work on implementing its measures has not stopped at any point. Dame Glenys Stacey has been appointed as chair of the office for environmental protection, and an announcement on appointments to the OEP’s board is being made today. A draft principles policy statement has just finished public consultation, and the Government have started developing our legally binding targets with experts. Technical consultations have been launched, for example on the deposit return scheme for drinks containers, extended producer responsibility for packaging and consistent recycling collections. I have spoken to many noble Lords already about measures in the Bill, for which I thank all noble Lords. I would like to notify the House that, in addition to the species abundance target and storm overflow amendments, I will table some devolution-related and minor amendments. First, I will table an amendment to increase the scope of the environmental principles duty for UK Ministers to cover reserved matters in Scotland. This will ensure that there is no gap in the application of the environmental principles, and that it is in line with the devolution settlement. Secondly, I will table a couple of amendments requested by Senedd Cymru to enable better collaboration between the OEP and the equivalent devolved bodies. Finally, I will table some minor amendments to ensure that consultations will count towards the statutory duty to consult, even if they are technically conducted before the Bill achieves Royal Assent Finally, I hope that noble Lords will agree that this truly is a landmark Bill. It provides a holistic approach, tackling real-world issues, such as simplified recycling systems, through to more structural changes to our environmental governance, ensuring that policy decisions account for the environment. This is an ambitious Bill that will aid our recovery and help us to meet our goals of net-zero emissions, stem the loss of biodiversity and reduce the damage that pollution does to our natural world I look forward to what I am absolutely certain will be a rigorous and lively debate. I expect nothing less for a Bill of such magnitude and gravity, at a time when we can wait no longer to act. I beg to move.']","<|system|>

Ladies and gentlemen, with the bill we are debating today, we are taking an important step towards the implementation of our \'target higher\' project, we can do better to upgrade public school. We change programmes, we establish new procedures, we gradually differentiate educational standards to provide our students with more and better equipment for the present and the future. Legislative interventions along with ministerial decisions, initiatives that will frame it and the subsequent legislation which concern, among other things, vocational education have a basic aim: a school that is more substantial, more qualitative and more open, higher expectations and requirements, which meets the need for more global education, more creative management and use of the knowledge provided and continuous self-assurance, a school of vigilance, the achievement of the learning objectives, the best educational results, a better and safer school environment, with clear procedures for imprinting and improving the quality of education. By investing, ladies and gentlemen, in his modern school today, we provide our children with more and better facilities for tomorrow and we are building together a more dynamic, more inclusive society with equal opportunities and inclusiveness. Because education is the most important mechanism for social mobility. Unfortunately, our country is lagging behind with other countries in terms of schoolchildren\'s performance on the basis of objective indicators. In 2018 in the international competition for the program ""PISA"" the Greek students ranked below the average of the contestants from seventy eight countries to three basic scribbling skills: understanding text, Mathematics, Natural Sciences. Indeed, the performance of our students was lower than in 2015. It was important for our students to be retarded in mild skills, but also in digital skills, technology and science skills. I put the results of this competition in the Minutes. [[At this point, the Minister for Education and Religious Affairs, Mr. Niki Kerameos, presents for the minutes the above document, which is in the archives of the Secretariat Department of the Department of Stenography and Practice of the Parliament.]] At the same time, the incidents of school bullying and infractionality continue in the school environment. At the beginning of the year, a seventeen - year - old student had to stay at the hospital after beating his classmates, while shortly before we witnessed one last year’s demolition incident, a teacher from her student in PAAL. Ladies and gentlemen, it is clear that a great deal needs to be done in our schools and the demands of the changing international environment are further intensified by the need to move quickly, with a plan and determination, so that we can gradually change the educational example, build the school of critical thought, the school of vigilance, the school of knowledge that teaches knowledge, at the same time as moral, the school which is made free and responsible. The general approach of the bill is upwards, with changes beginning with the kindergarten, such as the introduction of new themes and reaching examinations for introduction to higher education. At the same time, the bill contains regulations aimed at strengthening universities, such as promoting the extroversion of Greek universities through the establishment of foreign language departments and cooperation with foreign universities. Ladies and gentlemen, six are the main packages of reforms that we are introducing. First package of reforms: changes to education program and educational processes for a more creative, more open, more extroverted. We import Skill Labs, important innovation that we aspire to have transformative effects. Because the mission of the school, ladies and gentlemen, is not only knowledge, it is not just the transmission of knowledge, but also the development of skills to manage and exploit this knowledge. School mission is global education. In this direction new subjects are being piloted from next school year in the compulsory programme of preschools, primary and secondary schools, with skills proposed by the Council of Europe and the OECD, which will be valuable to pupils when they come to society tomorrow and to the constantly evolving labour market. Laboratories are organised in four thematic circles and their individual themes: ""Life"", with health education courses, such as dependency prevention, road safety, sexual education. Federal Centre for Health Education of 2019 research shows a significant number of European countries that have integrated sexual education into school curricula. Secondly, the \'environment\', with lessons such as ecological consciousness and prevention and protection against natural disasters, innovative, timely lessons in global educational systems. For example, in France and Portugal. Third Axis: Social consciousness and responsibility with volunteering, mutual respect and diversity programmes. Fourth Axis: Creative thinking and initiative with themes relating to advanced technologies in robotics, entrepreneurship, professional orientation. Youth entrepreneurship and entrepreneurship programmes are already being implemented in countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden. The goal of Skill Labs is to strengthen in a more coherent, more systematic way the cultivation of mild skills, life skills, technology and science skills, such as critical thinking, communication, initiative, creativity, adaptability, while familiarizing our teachers with more experiential teaching methods. With a look at the needs of the fourth industrial revolution, we focus more on learning and not just on content. Such pilot actions have been implemented in many countries internationally, such as, for example, in England, with the Health Minds pilot programme. Since 2020, the United Kingdom has introduced into the compulsory programme of schools, a programme of studies focusing on mild skills. Finland and other countries respectively. We have heard as a criticism of the Qualified Opposition that this was the thematic week. The institution of Skill Labs obviously has nothing to do with theme week. First of all, it concerns school life as a whole, kindergarten, primary, high school every week, not only a week, gentlemen of the Officerate, in the compulsory timetable, by training teachers in laboratory non-formal approach. It\'s not optional and it\'s not just about high school. The thematic week had no programme, no substantial training, no training or substantial skills culture. It was only for one week, it was only optional, only in high school fragmentary and sketchy, without morality and without any underlying coherent logic. For the Skill Labs, we addressed an open call to bodies that have prepared relevant training programmes. And the response was very large, three hundred thirteen proposals of educational programmes, as well as educational material for these themes, new skills, teaching in kindergartens, in primary school teachers, in high school teachers, in additional hours that we have added to both primary and high school. We import creative activities in English from kindergarten. It is piloted by the involvement of students in English through creative activities. Why? Because during pre-school age the foundations of learning, thinking and all mental processes are laid. Research has shown that children exposed in more than one language receive multiple cognitive benefits, such as solving problems, flexibility in knowledge and communication capabilities, creativity, cultural consciousness. But also in relation to the mother tongue, research shows that early acquisition of a second language increases the performance in the mother tongue of children. It has been a global trend since 2000, especially in the last decades, to learn foreign languages to be introduced into older and older ages. From three countries of Europe in 2015 to fourteen countries in 2019-Belgium, Bulgaria, Estonia, Spain, Cyprus, Croatia, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania, Finland, Malta - there is employment with a second foreign language since pre-school age. I shall return to the Minutes the relevant inquiry. [[At this point, the Minister for Education and Religious Affairs, Mr. Niki Kerameos, presents for the minutes the above document, which is in the archives of the Secretariat Department of the Department of Stenography and Practice of the Parliament.]] It is also happening in our country. Most private kindergartens have also introduced these activities in English for years. Of course, we have heard here in this Chamber from the Qualified Opposition that the introduction of English to the kindergarten of another special hidden interest serves as a check, he says, for American universities. Ladies and gentlemen, in conspiracy theories we respond with evidence, we respond with research, we respond with the recommendations of the international organizations to which our country is a member. One goal is to serve, to provide more and better supplies to our children. And it is not, as has been misunderstood, a matter of teaching in a separate lesson. This is first contact and familiarization with the English language through creative activities. Neither the uniform nor the available nature of the kindergarten programme is therefore affected. The English teacher will always carry out the activities with the presence of the kindergarten, respecting the specificity of the relationship between the kindergarten and the young children. Special training is provided for by the Institute for Education Policy for this pilot project. We are strengthening the teaching of cognitive objects through the bill, but also through the ministerial decisions they follow. Strengthen IT by adding three hours to high school and high school, one to high school, two to high school. Classics with our Ancients are reintroduced in the examination courses in high school and Latin in the pan-Hellenic examination courses of the third grade. Physical Education with the introduction of a two-hour and a two-hour high school. The addition of a third hour to the 3rd grade with the measurement of Physical Education in the general middle of high school and foreign languages with the addition of six hours, two hours in primary and four hours in high school. We are broadening the methods of assessing the progress of pupils, for example through research work, in IT, in political education, by strengthening the culture of critical thinking, research thought. And they increase the written courses in high school from four to seven and in high school from eight to six, four to eight, seven, five to monitor more systematically and study courses. I am establishing the high school-grade issue bank with immediate application in the first high school year 2020-2021. The Bank\'s operation is twofold: first, to ensure all the curriculum materials from all the schools in the country and, therefore, to avoid learning gaps and structural inequalities, to cover all the material. Secondly, the creation of a coherent reliable system for assessing the progress of pupils through the export of data on an objective basis. The establishment of the theme bank facilitates the design of educational policy by setting it on the right basis, continuous evaluation and where necessary reassessment, a review of the curriculum and learning standards and methods followed. The use of the themes bank in educational evaluation procedures has been a common practice in the international area for many decades. For example, in countries such as the European Union, in America at the Educational Testing Service, in states of Canada, Australia, China and even from the OECD. We introduce the logic of the ""kontra"" course in the third grade, with the aim of offering our children a wider culture and strengthening general education. This is why the history of students who choose practical direction and mathematics for students who choose theoretical direction is added to the third level. We streamline the process of promoting and dismissing pupils. In high school, the student is considered to have a merit of promotion when he has an annual rate of at least 10 or a general average of 15. Otherwise, if it has up to four lessons under the base, it can be re-examined in September. In high school, the general promotional average is increased to \'twelfth\'. Reset the gravity factors in the pan-Hellenic tests. This promotes more systematic follow-up and study of all courses throughout the school year, as well as the overall culture of pupils. The second package of reforms: Evaluation. Evaluation as a means of improving the educational process. As we were committed, we proceed with the evaluation of the school unit and the educational project, based on the three-tier programming - self-assessment - external evaluation. Ladies and gentlemen, in our country evaluation has been fought and fought as few reforms. And, unfortunately, it is discredited as a concept even today. The systematic evaluation of all the factors of the education process is a prerequisite for improving each educational system. It is necessary to identify needs and weaknesses which make it difficult to function and achieve the objectives set by the school itself. But it is also an opportunity to highlight opportunities and achievements because, yes, ladies and gentlemen, there are many possibilities, many bright examples of schools, inconvenient efforts of enlightened teachers with a sense of vision that their emergence can make a key contribution to the change of example in public education and is linked to the training of teachers. The evaluation is a unique opportunity for confidence in the public school. Evaluation and training are also interconnected. Both together contribute to ensuring the quality of the education project provided. This is exactly what we announced in November of 2018, when the New Democracy at the time as a military opposition had presented its full programme for education. That is why we committed ourselves in July 2019 to the government\'s programming statements, and that is what we are doing today. Programming, self-assessment, external evaluation and escalating implementation with respect to the capabilities of our school units and educational units and also responsibility for society. As we have said before, the evaluation of teachers will also follow after extensive consultation with all the institutions. Third package of reforms: More effective school units. We take special measures, special arrangements for the effective management of school units by correcting chronic pathogens. We motivate and set rules. Why, ladies and gentlemen, do you have many of you have to say \'But why, every year, every year, there are gaps?\' The previous government abolished the double molecules for teachers serving in low-skilled schools. We are therefore predicting a double moleculosis for those who nurse in inaccessible areas, providing incentives. We\'re reducing the duration of the paintings from two to three years. What does that mean in practice? That the pre-service and qualifications of teachers will be more quickly measured. But, ladies and gentlemen, we also have rules. The state must ensure that our schools are properly staffed across Greece. Thus, if a teacher who has chosen to serve in a particular area does not appear and does not perform a service as a debtor, there is a two-year exclusion from recruitment and a three-year exclusion for those who do not undertake a service in the schools chosen by teachers following nominal invitations. Because we must ensure that every child can go to a school with teachers wherever this school is located. And it is a debt we have as a state to ensure that our schools are properly staffed. [[At this point the doorbell ends the speech time of the Minister is ringing.]] Your tolerance, Mr President. Fourth package of reforms: Enlargement of the institution of pilot and experimental schools as innovation workshops for the dissemination of best practice in public education. We broaden the institution by making use of the positive experience of its previous attempt to introduce it in 2011, i.e. before the legislative interventions of the previous government and the significant expansion that took place in the two years 2012-2014. And we separate standards and experimental schools. In the standards of schools, we are strengthening the model of excellence in the sense of the constant self-assurance of pupils, which is why there is provision for introduction by exams. Experimental studies focus on the implementation of experimental methods, practices and new investment tools in a random sample of the student population. That\'s why you\'re supposed to import by draw. These schools are jointly a national educational workshop to design and implement differentiated and innovative educational policies. Since September 2020, twenty-eight pilot and thirty-four experimental schools have been scheduled to operate. Experimental schools remain secondary schools of Athens, Thessaloniki, Macedonia, Patras and Crete. The rest are currently operating as experimental, now characterised by standards and is also planned to issue an open call from 2020 for the conversion of other public schools into standards and experimental ones, based on criteria to be specified. A key pillar of the operation of these schools is the evaluation of the educational project, the evaluation of teachers. Our aim is for these schools to function as a tool for disseminating best practice in education. Here, too, they really give an almond impression about the position of Officer Opposition. Initially in 2015, they said excellence was a relic. But the ideoleptic sign is now returning more closely with the Officerial Representation\'s representative describing schools standards as ""carcinoma"" in the innermost of public education. He\'ll suck off and feed on the bleeding of the other schools. I think these words speak for themselves. Unfortunately, you are abstracting these exceptional public schools, the opportunity for students to study at these exceptional schools. You are reversing the functioning of these schools as a tool for disseminating best practices in education. And that is the difference between the balance downwards that you represent and the real application of the principle of equality and equal opportunities that we promote. This is the difference between the logic of the minor effort which you represent and the logic of lasting improvement and vigilance that we are trying to show. You don\'t want anyone to stand out, you don\'t want anyone to stand out. You want them all equals. But equals how? Down. And Mrs Xinoyannakopoulos, who will take the floor shortly after having answered the question of how, if I am not mistaken, the government of George Papandreou, the Minister of Anna Diamantopoulou who introduced the institution, now comes and embraces these views on carcinoma in the hearts of public education. Fifth package of reforms: More secure school environment. We are taking steps to establish a safer school environment. Amongst other things, we are establishing the schoolteacher, a teacher who undertakes to be the first disembodiment of the educational community in case, for example, of an incident of school intimidation. The advisor shall work in addition to supporting the Association of Teachers and other staff of education, as well as the existing institutions and mechanisms to support school units and contribute to the development of a climate of trust between the members of the school community and to the inclusive integration of the principles of education. Sixth package of reforms: Greater freedom, autonomy, extrovert to higher education. We are introducing more freedom, more autonomous, more extroverted institutions, thus further implementing our election commitments. We are strengthening the extroversion of universities, as the universities themselves have asked us to do. Because that\'s also questioned. I am tabling the decision of the Rectors\' Conference, which specifically refers to the operation of foreign-language curriculum. [[At this point, the Minister for Education and Religious Affairs, Mr. Niki Kerameos, presents for the minutes the above document, which is in the archives of the Secretariat Department of the Department of Stenography and Practice of the Parliament.]] And the possibility is to establish foreign-language undergraduate programmes autonomously from each university without a partnership with the international university and without a Minister\'s approval, which you never wanted to leave from powers. We therefore make our commitment to universities more free and autonomous, for universities which can regulate their homes. Our legislative initiatives are part of the most comprehensive project that contributes to the qualitative upgrading of the educational project provided, to the strengthening of Greece as an international educational centre that attracts students from around the world. Next week I have a teleconference with foreign universities, leading universities, who want to work with our own excellent universities, with our own excellent human resources: teachers, students, all the educational potential, the administrative staff of our universities. We must give them the framework so that these cooperations can only be implemented for the benefit of our universities. And we are introducing an academic criterion in the translations, along with streamlining the existing economic and social criteria. Here too, serving equal opportunities and the quality of the studies provided, establishing the minimum degree of relocation as a criterion. So, on the one hand, we guarantee a fair distribution of students - we do not have the phenomenon of low molecules in schools and departments that require a very high number of molecules - and we also ensure the uninterrupted academic function with students who are able to meet the requirements of their studies. We are amending the procedure for the promotion of the Republican authorities on the basis of a single vote for a four-year term, serving the need for a better functioning of the university. Ladies and gentlemen, we are providing tools, we are giving further impetus to our universities to broaden their horizons within the country and outside the country. Ladies and gentlemen, I have briefly presented to you the basic reforms and innovations we are introducing with this bill. A bill that we collectively worked with all the political leadership, the entire Ministry of Education, with the Deputy Minister Sophia Zacharakis, with the Deputy Minister Vassilis Digalakis, with all the relevant Secretary-General. Our aim is to find solutions despite adversity. Our guarantee is to give our students, our students, more and better supplies. Our ambition is to put the bar increasingly higher and invest in the human potential of education, because this is the Greece of the creation that we want to serve. Because we can do better, because we deserve better. Thank you very much.', 'Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the plan we are debating today completes the first cycle of the necessary institutional reform in education, which we step by step - in the adverse conditions of the memorandum, by rectifying the validity of public education in response to the agony and expectations of young children and their families. We sought consent, without overlooking the understandable ideological and political differences. We have sought this with the conclusion of the Committee on National and Social Dialogue for Education, chaired by Professor Antonis Liakou, as well as with the work done by the Committee on Morphic Affairs of the House with the President at that time, the current Minister, Mr Gavroglou, because we believe that education, health and social welfare, which are the backbone of the social state and the conditions for the development of society, constitute what is called common good and we must preserve it from the veteran party confrontation. We have seen images, I fear, of such a sterile confrontation. I don\'t pretend I don\'t hear the objections about the procedure. There are many times pleasing objections. It\'s usually done. However, we must say that there is a limit to this frequent and persistent debate on the procedure, and that limit is that we must also go to the main issues. The Multilateral Plan completes the necessary interventions in the field of secondary education, as well as arrangements for the establishment of the single area of higher education and research. The success of these changes requires a social consensus climate, but also material support from the state is needed and, as we try to get out of the general crisis and austerity in a clear development with social justice, increasing state funding in education. We have already moved from this year to massive appointments to education: Fifteen thousand in total over this three-year period and from them four and a half thousand this year for the first time permanent appointments to special education. In tertiary education we have created five hundred new IPA posts, a thousand five hundred positions for academic experience, and three hundred outgoing posts will be completed every year due to university retire ment. Finally, the deforestation of universities by staff. I would remind you that our government also saved the education from bankruptcy, condemned by the Samara - Venizelos government, which in the medium term had anticipated less than EUR 1 billion in relation to what we have given. Also, for the first time on SYRIZA, research expenditure increased, reaching 1% of GDP. And these overthrows that create a positive perspective for education would not be possible if the economy with the great sacrifices of Greek citizens did not come out of the harsh commemorative coercives. Even if the government did not have a strategic choice, even in the dark of the memorials, to keep hope alive through progress in education. For democratic reform in education, it is a necessary condition for us to get out of the crisis, without repeating the mistakes of the past, with social justice, humanitarian education, with a school that responds to the educational, pedagogical, psychological needs of the child, whose focus is today\'s child and adolescent, the so-called \'growth of the Internet\', which highlights the need for a new way of democratic functioning of school and social inclusion. And all this, building an educational system linked to the economy and the labour market, but not subordinate to a market perception of education. Ladies and gentlemen, the heart of the bill is the upgrading of high school and the limitation of stress that stigmatizes the lives of today\'s teenagers in their attempt to get into higher education. First, who disputes that high school today, and in particular High school III, is detested to the conscience of children, as the content of the courses is far from the central aim of children for admission to HEIs? We all know that high school life has turned into a hypocrisy. This is not about the heroic effort of teachers. This is an objective fact which, unfortunately, limits the efforts of teachers. This hypocrisy also crumbles the morality of many teachers, since they feel they cannot mobilize the interest of students and students with what their state entrusts them to teach. Therefore, we must give the Third High School a substantial character, because, among other things, a domino has been created that affects all classes in high school, and even the Second, where we have early school phenomena. Secondly, second grade is dealt with by the bill only as a general education class, which is not currently the case. The guidance courses referred to in the future import examinations are being abolished and therefore they encourage children to enter the preconditioning climate early on. Thirdly, for the first time, there is the possibility of introducing into a pan-Hellenic-organised examination, only conditional on the removal of the diploma in certain schools, which is a first step towards the future extension of this possibility. It is also important that this measure is in the same direction as the introduction of free access for graduates of vocational education to two-yearly structures of HEIs. Fourthly, the third grade includes courses all relevant, both for the dismissal and for the process of introduction to higher education. There\'s no lesson in less interest. Of course, without being explained, and without reasonable arguments, the lesson of the religious ones in the third grade is maintained. This, however, is another priest gospel. By the way, Minister, I would like to ask, with the qualifications of studies where the religion is maintained, what are you going to do? All Greek citizens do not have a religion in their identity. Why do our children have to have a religion in the subjects of study, Minister? Fifth, not this year, but from the new year it will be taken into account for the introduction to the HEIs and the degree of dismissal, after the confidence in its objectivity has been established. Sixth, classes in the 3rd grade will be taught six hours a week, without the material being overcrowded, in order to have a comfortable time in teaching. Within the programme of the 3rd grade, there is also a separate time for cooperation between teachers and pupils to deepen, resolve queues and practice. It\'s a groundbreaking institution. We believe that with the new III high school system and the new system of admission to the HEI, on the one hand, we attribute the educational character to high school and on the other, households are relieved from the economic bleeding of the care centres, which is estimated at EUR 2 billion a year. Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard the criticism that general education is downgrading with the new high school. This is a misunderstanding or a deliberate falsification of our proposals. First of all, the deterioration in general education is currently taking place in high school with the full education of outside schools as a whole. Secondly, there is also international experience, according to which the courses of the last class are identical to the courses of examinations, dismissals or introductorys. Let\'s study it. Thirdly, in this system of exotic courses, the bill provides as an understated lesson, therefore an exotic lesson in Greek language, which, as you know, is a lesson that approaches issues of more general interest, cultural and topicality and identity for young children. In other words, someone who wants to go to any school, to medicine, for example, or to the polytechnic, is obliged to take six hours new Greek and language. This is a real upgrade of the general education of high school - and not of the words - and of secondary education as a whole. When we talk about general education, we cannot only talk about the multiple cognitive objects that cover all or many levels. General education is the education that covers the multiple objectives of education. In this sense, it is important to teach various types of writing and knowledge on various subjects that contribute to the creation of democratic and active citizens, that is to say, to cultivating values and attitudes inspired by the principles of democracy, equality and ecology. Pedagogical factors also know that the villa is more effective than a thousand lectures and in this sense general education is also the cultivation of horizontal skills and competences, which concern all areas of knowledge and life. There are many things left for the school that we are planning, such as systematic professional orientation, education on certain issues, including parents and local institutions, the renewal of the institution of student communities as a cell of democratic participation at a time when atomicism, anti-political and extreme right intolerance, which we have seen recently, are attempting to infiltrate into schools and distort the genuine patriotic feeling of children in nationalist hatred and xenophobia. The central, however, bet on the school of general education is the modernization of curricula and books by establishing methods of teaching that give students an active role, evaluation based more on synthetic and creative work, i.e. evaluation more qualitative than quantitative. This school we are planning and wanting a step - a step from now on, without wasting time, with the greatest possible consensus, to move forward. As far as the other provisions are concerned, I am keeping the consent of the majority of university bodies with some reservations about university and TEI synergies, the proposal from the TEI to upgrade the engineering departments with the participation of two representatives of the committee accepted by the Minister. I would point out that the proposed new system for the recognition of professional qualifications, which is good, must take into account the eighteen thousand current college students. A solution is perhaps - and it will be discussed in dialogue - the transition of the ESA by 2022, when the current student cycle is completed. The draft law lacks provisions for the EDPS. It is about a thousand workers at universities that all have doctoral and certain teaching orders, but they are not recognized in this regard. This injustice causes a mess that needs to be addressed. Ladies and gentlemen, two and a half years ago, in September 2016, we had the only debate in the House on education to date. Already in May 2016, Mr. Mitsotakis had announced the abolition of the full-time school, while the press-friendly press predicted that the government would close thousands of classes in kindergartens and primary schools. Of course, none of Mr Mitsotakis\' cassantisms were confirmed. They were opposition bricks and horns, completely thrown out. So what happened then? Instead of the previous chaos, regularity. For the first time after many years all schools everywhere worked normally, from the first day, with their necessary staff and books. Instead of a whole-strong zero, the most incompetent post-multiple government, such as Mr. Mitsotakis likes to characterize it, took it perfectly. A big achievement that had to be self-evident, but it wasn\'t. It was, however, because it was repeated last year and before the Ministry’s new leadership. And so now we can talk about an inspiring regularity. That is why we warn the students and parents: If you want the normality and a quality public school of knowledge and democratic equality, do not allow the re-establishment of the status of authoritarianism, the reduced budgets for education, the anointedness with the abolition of the rule one goes away, one coming from our Government and its replacement from rule five are leaving, one that comes more troika than the New Democracy has adopted. Do not allow the New Democracy to do its reactionary, neoliberal conception in favour of the schools of the few, the schools of the aristocratic elites, against the public school, the school of many of whom we defend, its perception of inequality as a natural option, the conversion of pupils into customers for schools - businesses, which in the neoliberal vocabulary are renamed to ""instructoral skills providers"". It is Mr Mitsotakis himself, who at the tenth conference of the New Democracy called the students \'clients\' and thus the education of \'goods\'. You knock a very wrong door, gentlemen of the New Democracy, when you exhaust the inventiveness of your programme for education in how you will implant into the minds of children, as a supreme value, the idea that society will always be made up of bosses and submissives, of fathers and plebes, of ""excellent"" and ""successful"". So if you were given the opportunity, you would have put the teaching of entrepreneurship even from the nursery. Because this concept or rather the social class position you express is the supreme social value to you. Gentlemen of the New Democracy, an equation downwards but also the opposite of excellence is: Do not act in the years of fat cows, the two-year-old pre-school education which we have been implementing since this year. To operate two or more types of kindergartens and primary schools, instead of a single formula that we have established, in general, the institution of the full day\'s school. To be subjected to examinations at all classes and no additional teaching support is available, which returns. Not so many years of review, modernisation and adaptation of school books, which is happening nowadays at the Institute of Education Policy. To have the lesson of the Religious homologous, dogmatic and not to apply the new programs of the Religious which we have now introduced are normally taught, regardless of the reactions raised by the known circles, which must be done boldly and in the history of which the new curriculum for all classes has already been drawn up. There should be no psychologists in schools, which we predicted and promoted this year by teams of schools in about a thousand cities. There\'s no theme week. There should be no opening-up of school to modern considerations and searches for outlets of youth pressing problems, such as dependencies, depression, meaninglessness, bowling and the problems of a generation lost many times in the virtual world of the internet and social media. To be regarded as schools of a lower god as the schools of Special Education, the schools that SYRIZA generally supported as much as anything else, setting up forty new schools and five hundred seventy branches of integration and doubling their duties with thousands of placements of assistants and scientific assistants. To be the PSAs the backyard of education rather than the upgraded PSAs that we created before with our colleague, Mr Vaxebanakis, and now with my colleague, Mrs Jufi, with a rich programme, with apprenticeships for the first time in enterprises and with incentives to introduce into universities and the two-year university technical education programmes. Identify standards and experimental methods and be unable to understand that experimentation involves a differentiated level of students and not horse race training, and when Baltas points this out, you can spread him through the lousy retreat of excellence. You must not have made any preparations for the education of the applicants, which this government has done since zero when your right-wing, but also your self-government actors, gentlemen of the New Democracy, have lifted Ookastras and walls of exclusion, racism and intolerance. Not even a school meal has been given to degraded schools for your days and those who denounced child malnutrition in the years of the crisis must be taken into account. And that\'s what SYRIZA did in nine hundred and fifty-four municipal schools, over a hundred and fifty thousand children. And when with the Greek people\'s vote in the autumn we become government again, we will extend it to five hundred thousand children. Have reduced the education budget for five years 2010-2014, as foreseen by the medium-term government of Samaras - Venizelos. And another reduction: One billion less for education for 2018, 2019 and the next years than our Government is giving today so that you can promise tax reliefs and gifts to your rich friends, the fewer and the big owners. Stand, without pretext, with the owners of private schools and care. To abolish every control of the state in these schools and to form the employment relationships of the jungle in private schools and in schools, which we overturned together with the movement of private teachers of OELE, bringing back to the Ministry of Education the supervision of private education. Preparing in the name of a so-called free parental selection the coupons in education, i.e. funding with public money from private schools and the formation and in the public sector of schools of many speeds, with well-paid and badly punished by sub-funding and staff cuts and with poor parents playing LOT and trying to find a place for their child not in their neighborhood as today, but in the considered schools of the finest. To raise the positions of universities in international rankings and you to denounce and discredit the public university as a man of violence, illegality and drug trafficking - we also heard Mr Mitsotakis yesterday - by magnifying existing problems and diseases. To hide the evidence, for example, the investigation of PAMAK, the University of Macedonia, which showed that the incidents of lawlessness in your universities over your days and with the abolition of asylum, were more than that in our own government with asylum to return. For example, with PAMAK’s survey data, we had ninety-six cases of violence in 2012, thirty-nine in 2013, seventy-seven in 2014. And then, on SYRIZA, a clear reduction despite the reinstatement of asylum: thirty one in 2015, thirty one in 2016, forty-six in 2017. Have shrunk your political speech in education into a goal, in a pursuit: transform the degraded colleges of Canigos and the northern suburbs into universities without any academic condition. Universities in euphemism. It is metabolised IEC at the bottom of the international rankings. Their recognition and revocation at universities are the aim of the New Democracy and of Mr.Mitsotakis personally, who, in a role of interest, is fighting to ensure that they are given customers. This is behind the attack of the New Democracy on Article 16 and on the idea of private HEI. On the contrary to excellence, it is still to have done nothing about the brain fleeing and instead of saying ""bravo"", attacking Mr. Fotakis who set up the ELDEK, ELIDEK with the funding of EUR 270,000,000 and the programs that they give to thousands of doctors and postdoctors to stay and create in our country. Stay in words and have done nothing to strengthen innovative entrepreneurship, and now we have the activities of the Secretariat-General for Research and Technology with EUR 500,000,000, the ""EREGO, DIMUROVO"", with EUR 360,000,000, six hundred five research projects, four thousand four hundred new quality jobs, the establishment and operation of the Business Participation Fund to create a start-up business. I could speak for hours and list all your work in education, gentlemen of the New Democracy. In the Minutes, however, I put forward a list of ninety-two actions, which are our work on education, on the reverse of your own practice. [[At this point, the Member, Mr Nikolaos Philis, presents for the minutes the above document, which is in the archives of the Secretariat Department of the Department of Stenography and Practice of the Parliament.]] I also ask Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Kerameos present: What will you do away with if a miracle brings you to power? For many, Mr. Mitsotakis has said he will abolish all the laws of Balta, Phil and Gavroglou. So, all the things I mentioned or any of them? And the hundred and ninety-two changes or some of them? We want an answer and not a sterile procedural controversy. No, ladies and gentlemen of the New Democracy, as much catastrophe as take news and if you are being recruited, you will not eradicate from the conscience of the Greek people a truth: This government in very difficult budgetary conditions has presented a very important project in the field of education in the four years that passed. Not only did he keep the education upright, but he armed it with new conquests and possibilities and unfolded an integrated plan of interventions, tombs and reforms that literally changed the landscape of education, from preschool education to research, from kindergarten to high school and higher education, which we are debating today, from the bottom up with a plan, bold and vision, the school of quality and equality. And this project can proceed with a new momentum in the new four-year left-wing governance. This momentum also prescribes the multiplier plan under discussion. This momentum will be decisively strengthened by the Greek people\'s vote in the European elections, in the municipal and regional elections in October, giving SYRIZA the victory and the first place. On this determination we will build an even more stable, new generation of reforms and changes in the next four years in education, in the social state, in the economy, everywhere, where Greek citizens live and create, the people of work and the youth of our country. For Greece that we deserve, for Greece of many, for the Europe of the peoples. Thank you.', 'Thank you, Madam President. Ladies and gentlemen, starting with my speech on the issues of education, seeing to me and Trinidad Mitafidis, I can only mention all those brilliant forms of educational and educational movement that have sealed the history of modern Greek education. For example, we should remember the work and activities of Dimitris Glinos, Alexandros Delmou, Rosa Impriotis, Alexiou, Milatos Kounturas, Evangelos Papanoutsos, Emmanouil Kriaras, as well as the thousands of educational anonymouss and surnames who have fought with dignity and free thinking, dedicating in this case the sacrifice of Nikos Temponeras, which was killed on 8 January 1991, to the latest history, protecting the school and its students. To these teachers, presenting our government program, finds our thoughts and souls and with their own works as a deposit we have eyes turned to the new generation, to all students and students, but especially to the backbone children, because they need our support most. The aim for which our Government works is to organise public free-of-democratic-level education. The first stone of our programme is a worthwhile stone, that is, we are aiming to alleviate the cultural inequalities that have their roots in social class inequalities, as well as to eliminate all kinds of discrimination, gender, race, religion and beliefs, social and national origin, the physical specificity of individuals and others from the institutional framework, as well as from the everyday life of education. In this direction we intend - and the quote is not accidental - to align our institutional framework with those laid down by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabled Persons, including disabilities in school for all. Reintroduce in an upgraded form the reinforcement of teaching and additional teaching support. To develop intercultural and anti-racist education and reception classes. To draw up programmes for support for the school population and the respective school units, mainly concerning vulnerable groups of young people, namely in difficult areas, people with financial tolerance, in Roma people, in relation to the infringability of minors. Strengthen the education of Greek children abroad, which is being seen. Let us move on to a substantial upgrading of the education of Muslim children in Thrace, in order to address school-leaving phenomena, to ensure their equal access to all levels and types of public education and to ensure the scientific training of teachers who teach this population category. We are ending the policy of dismantling and merging school units. However, we are reviewing the operation of school units which have been abolished on the basis of educational and social criteria. Ladies and gentlemen, the second stone is the satisfaction of the pressing educational needs after five years of austerity and monumental intervention. As we have said, our aim is to reconstruct public and free education of all levels, with universal participation of all young people throughout the fourteen-year range - that is, twelve plus two pre-school education. In particular: Firstly, the memorial laws that have dissolved and degraded public education cease to apply. We are moving towards the establishment of a transitional institutional framework for all levels of education, opening, as the Prime Minister and the Minister of Education said, a broad dialogue with all involved. In cooperation with other co-legislative ministries, we are moving towards measures to relieve the humanitarian crisis, as the Deputy Minister, Mr Fotio, said, through preventive medicine, vaccination and food aid programmes, namely breakfast and small meals for students. We are starting today to redesign the detailed programmes and the school manuals. We aim to restructure the matter in the direction of reducing the volume of information for the sake of deepening and critical thought. Our aim is for the books next school year to be in time in schools and any changes in matter will not necessarily mean changing the school manuals next year, because we do not have time. We are exploring all the necessary conditions for achieving a reduction in the number of pupils per section, of course, insofar as the opportunities are to cover the places of training with permanent posts. I repeat: with permanent positions. At the school we have all nursed, we know that some lessons are primates and some secondary ones. For us primates are all those lessons that shape the prerequisites for becoming tomorrow\'s citizens educated, with critical thought and aesthetic culture. To this end we want our worthy place to cover general education in the public school of all knowledge and experience to get flesh and bone. To this end, aesthetic education, the cultivation of arts, physical education, health education, environmental education, information technology, the education of the democratic citizen shall be designed as equal and necessary aspects of the analytical programme together with traditional circular knowledge. We are working towards upgrading and gradually reintroducing the teaching of more foreign languages at school, according to pedagogical criteria. We want the possibility of obtaining certificates of language instruction from the public school so that the family budget can be relieved. Finally, in this section, we make the school center of the neighborhood, the social area of creation, open and after the end of the courses for cultural, sport, social solidarity and others, in cooperation with the educational community, the residents of the neighborhood and local authorities. In particular, for high school we strengthen the autonomous cultural role of the lyric, with the restoration of the essential equivalence - in general and technical professional direction - and our strategic aim is the single school of theory and practice, making use of the positive features of the experience of multi-classical high school. Thus, as the Minister of Education mentioned, we are launching the disconnection of pre-school and secondary examinations from the process of introduction to higher education. We are reintroducing the general average of 9.5 for promotion from one class to another. We remove the pan-Hellenic exams in the 1st and 2nd grades from the current school year, as we abolish the mandatory selection of 50% of the themes of the high school exams from the themes bank. As we have said, the bank will remain an advisory tool for teachers and students. Let us note that the money spent on the topic bank was EUR 1,570,000. With this money, a thousand alternates could have been hired to deal with part of the educational gaps. As mentioned by the Minister of Education, in cooperation with the relevant ministries, the reintroduction of school guards that have been made available is under way. We plan to upgrade public technical vocational education and reorganise the ESDP programmes. We provide equal access to higher education for their graduates. We are abolishing post-training TECs, i.e. schools of vocational training and remodeling the post-mortem year of PSAs from the year of apprenticeship, in the year of qualification of PSA graduates and re-establishing them from informal in formal education. They are reopening, in accordance with our commitments, the PSAs from the school year 2015-2016, the sectors and specialities of PSAs and PSAs that were abolished by Law.4146/2013. The teachers of the fifty specialties of technical vocational education repealed by Article 82 of Law No 4172/2013 shall be placed directly in the PES. For this year, you need to know that there are teachers who were paid with 75% and stayed in their homes. These teachers return and exploit for the educational and administrative needs of public schools in laboratory centres, in areas that can work, in IEKs and in the Ministry of Education services. Particularly for this year\'s pan-Hellenic examinations, as mentioned by the Minister of Education, and for the next two school years, we will ensure that the educational functions are not disturbed and that there are some urgent issues which facilitate them. So, first of all, for this school year, the examination procedures and arrangements concerning the dismissal from high school and the introduction to higher education of the students and students in the third grade remain the same. Secondly, for the third high school year of next year, in other words for students in the second grade, we are studying the possibility of communication - and it will soon be announced - of the scientific fields of specialisation so that candidates can choose more than one scientific field. The promotion grades of the 1st and 2nd grades and the degree of dismissal of the 3rd grades will not be counted to the level of access to higher education. Finally, we are opening up the dialogue with society on the new system of introduction to the HEIs, which will obviously take several years in the prospect of free access to higher education. Preprimary and primary education: We lay firm foundations for a public quality pre-school and primary education, which will provide all the necessary facilities for students and lay the foundations for the drastic reduction of school failure in the next grades. Ladies and gentlemen, we can assure the Greek people that we will do everything necessary to ensure that all children have uninterrupted access to public free two-year pre-school education throughout Greece. We emphasise the necessary infrastructure and staffing with the necessary staff. We ensure the quality upgrade of primary and full-day school. The desert villages without schools and the school units ""mumuth"" in urban areas are images that do not satisfy us and do not comply with modern teaching. Finally, in this section, the recent circular of the previous Minister of Education, on the change of the timetable since March 2015, is being revoked. Special treatment. We should all know and have embraced the fact that the training of disabled or even special educational needs is a fundamental indicator of culture. The declared ‘one school for all’ principle refers to the neighborhood school, in which all children with or without disabilities are enrolled and supported, staffed, equipped and formulated, so that the objective of integration and inclusion is consistently achieved. Of course there will also be special schools dealing with children whose kind of disability or their multiple disabilities do not allow them to join the public school. But we should stress that these structures are designed for personalized cognitive, recreational and sports programmes tailored to the needs of each student and support services are provided to both their students and their families. We will see to it that the institutionalised diagnostic bodies of the CEDEFOP and CEDEFOP are fully upgraded and supported, and that is our priority. We will proceed from this year to the implementation of the single recruitment table of substitutes for special educational and special assistant staff, as well as the rehabilitation of teachers serving the structures of special education and being made available by the abolition of their branches. Parallel support is granted to the disabled learner regardless of the existence of a school membership section. Too many parents are worried. We have announced this since the previous parliamentary term. The Special Education Act will be drafted from zero to zero with consideration of the proposals of all stakeholders. In the case of the education of children with disabilities and special educational needs, we want to have parents allies and partners. As far as private education is concerned, I would like to highlight three points. Firstly, we are supervising, as Article 16 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights requires, the maintenance of constitutional legitimacy in the establishment and functioning of private schools. Secondly, we are reforming and updating the legal framework governing the operation of private schools and schools on the basis of educational and scientific criteria and we are committed to its absolute compliance. Thirdly, we are ensuring, for reasons of social and public interest, the working rights of private teachers who return to the Ministry of Education and who cease to fall within the Ministry of Labour. We are again here, as in other categories of workers in the private sector, the institution of collective agreements. Finally, in this section, we are reconstructing the abstract private education management of the Ministry of Education. Ladies and gentlemen, the creation of a climate of cooperation and mutual trust between the state and the educational community together with the continuous free - I stress - training of teachers and democratic reconstruction of education are a safe prerequisite for the success of our efforts. The current procedures, as the Minister said, have not contributed to the creation of such a climate and have injured the educational community. This is why they are suspended, as are any disciplinary or promotional consequences, in order to examine in depth all relevant factors. The replacement of the current legislative framework for the evaluation of teachers and schools by a system of evaluation of educational and teaching work in a democratic and collective manner is necessary. However, we realise - and take care of this - that the operational assessment of educational work is a participatory and democratic methodology for the diagnosis of problems, for solutions and for the preparation of proposals and measures to improve the quality of education. Under no circumstances is it a tool for the hierarchical and financial distinction between school units or a penalty for wage differentiation and administrative discipline of \'officials\', as we considered them to be. He\'ll tell you tomorrow and Mr. Katrugalos that we\'re abolishing all the disciplinary legislative mesh of n. Date of birth: 4057/2012 and No 4093/2012. Up to its overall reform, the anti-constitutional arrangements of the Disciplinary Law shall be immediately abolished, such as the provision that the staff member wishes on a holiday or a referral to the Disciplinary Board and the provision laying down as an offence manifestly inappropriate or inappropriate or unworthy conduct in or out of service. We recognise that participation in trade union or other social activity is in no way an inappropriate behaviour. We ensure the transparency of procedures in all service changes as mentioned by the Minister. Our Government will not tolerate any of the well-known practices of a clientele of a pedagogical and administrative authoritarian expression of the days and the reward of the minor effort. We will immediately draw up a new democratic framework for the operation of school units and managers with an upgraded role - I stress - of teachers\' associations. Finally, we are committed that, for all aspects of our programme, we will be opening up a broad and substantial dialogue with all those involved in the educational process, with teachers, students, parents, the scientific community, the officials of the public administration. I want us to work together openly and honestly with everyone. We set the educational goals and plan a specific timetable to finally create an educational system that promotes the joy of knowledge and learning, so that our children love school. We want children happy, with the optimism of life, who will love their fellowman, regardless of color, race and religion. We want young people and young people with an uprooted mind, who will not go sketchy, and above all will only be leaned to give hands and help those who are low. Thank you.']","<|system|>

Ladies and gentlemen in the Federal Government! Dear High House! Dear spectators at home in front of the TV screens or via live stream! Today is a historic day, that has already been said. That's what he might be for me personally, but that's not what it's all about. It's a historic day for the Greens, but it's not primarily about me now. It is about that, as a result of the climate and environmental programme in the government programme of this Federal Government, I believe, we can actually celebrate a historic day in terms of climate and environmental protection in Austria. I am very pleased that I am able to present this part of the government programme to you today, because we have done a great deal to address no more and no less than the key challenges of our future, and to take responsibility for a climate-neutral, ecological, but also for a just and economically sustainable Austria. Climate neutrality by 2040 is the goal we have set ourselves in this government programme. In fact, this is a scale and challenge that is appropriate to the historical responsibility we stand before. It has been mentioned many times today: In Australia, a continent, an area is now burning in the size of Austria. However, we do not have to look so far, we only have to remember the last summer: the heat waves, the wall drains, the great damage in agriculture. The climate crisis has arrived in Austria, so we need the courage and determination in the action provided by this government programme to address this crisis. It's Friday, Friday afternoon: Not far from here are young people standing on the street again to work for their future. The responsibility for this future, the responsibility for a viable future in Austria, however, is shared here, and it is we who will shape this transformation, this change process. I would like to look at young people, because we will need their strength, their persistence, their energy, their courage to design and their will to change in order to implement this programme together and to live up to what our historical responsibility in this situation is based on scientific facts. This is the responsibility of the Federal Government, and I am very pleased to be part of it personally. [[Congratulation with Greens and ÖVP.]] I am convinced that the conditions for decisive action on climate change have rarely been as good as they are now, including with regard to social support. That is why it is so important that we, together with the people in the federal government, in the countries and in the communities, come into implementation. Climate protection – it is especially important to me to say this today – is not a renunciation programme, but a programme of opportunities. It is a programme for a more quality of life, for a more clean air, for more space, more health, more justice and yes, more economic opportunities. That is why I am particularly pleased that the chapter on industry and the economy in our government programme on climate protection is being used as an innovation boost and as a production of a sustainable basis especially for our industry and economy. Climate protection is the opportunity to set us up for the future, so I would like to expressly invite us to dialogue at this point. Austria 2040 is an overall social project involving many innovative entrepreneurs. However, we must also develop it together and in dialogue with the workers who will accompany this transformation. [[Congratulation with Greens and ÖVP.]] I've already said it: Climate neutrality 2040 as a goal is a central part of this government programme. It is our ambition to get to the top of European climate protection. Accordingly, we will also step up our efforts at European level and support the EU Commission's efforts to adapt climate change targets by 2030 and 2050 respectively, in order to get Europe on a path towards meeting the Paris climate agreement. Objectives are important, at least equally important are concrete measures. Therefore, allow me to present you briefly some of the concrete measures contained in this government programme. The eco-social tax reform has already been mentioned, it is a central concern, so I would like to take a brief look at it. We have done it in two steps: 2021 with six very concrete projects announced in the government programme. It is a matter of ensuring that climate-friendly behaviour is worthwhile by means of central parking screws in the control system, that climate-friendly behaviour is calculated. In a second step, which is now being jointly developed, it is about addressing the pricing of emissions – of course, with compensatory measures for the economy and private ones. It is about taking account of regional differences, of social differences, and of creating this environmental-social tax reform well and together. We have proposed the introduction of a climate protection law, we have proposed the introduction of a climate check, i.e. we make climate protection a central criterion in the legislative process. There are numerous horizontal measures in the climate and energy programme which, I think, can significantly improve our cooperation in this area. Finally, I would like to talk about mobility and energy. We have done a lot about mobility. I am glad that this has already been taken up positively today. On the one hand, we are concerned with creating the strategic foundations for the further development of the mobility system. The centrepiece for this is the Mobility Master Plan 2030. It is a strategic reorientation of the mobility system towards the achievement of the Paris climate targets, and this is complete by a master plan of freight transport. It is indeed a great challenge that we are facing. The core of all of our considerations is a sustainable mobility for all in the city and also in the rural regions. In order to achieve this, there are two key approaches: Development of public transport, attractive further development of rail infrastructure as a backbone of environmentally friendly public transport. The public authorities for urban and rural development Space has already been widely used. That's right. Expanding the already good public service offer is a central concern. We want to improve the offer and the clocking under the title Guaranteed mobile and the tariff offer with a cheap Austrian annual network ticket. With the 1-2-3 ticket, we also want to implement a long-term transport policy requirement and thus make public transport in Austria even more attractive. We have a very good offer in Austria, but we also have a benchmark, which is our neighbours in Switzerland, and it is worth looking at and in this sense developing the public offer for all in this country with more quality of life. [[Congratulation with Greens and ÖVP.]] As regards active mobility, there is also a lot in the government programme: a bicycle offensive, the attraction of pedestrian traffic, accessibility – all these are important topics in environmentally friendly mobility. Of course, it is also important in road transport to take great steps towards decarbonisation, changeover to renewable energy sources and alternative drives. To take big steps also means to show the administration: CO2-neutral, climate-neutral management is a major issue in this government agreement with a large number of measures. I think that we really have opportunities to move forward on the key issue of mobility and to take the next steps towards freedom of emission across the mobility sector. I would also like to mention briefly the transport of goods. There we want to put initiatives on greater cost-truth at national and EU level, to make use of scope for ecologicalisation, especially in the area of transit traffic. This is an essential problem, an essential issue in Austria. We want to relieve the people who are affected by it on a daily basis. In the face of the difficult market background, moving goods from road to rail is also a central issue of this government programme. Apart from the major transit routes, we also want to put in place measures to strengthen the local freight and logistics industry, but on the other hand to develop new, experimental solutions to give space to innovative concepts. On the last two points: I have the honour – according to your consent today to the Federal Ministry Act – then to lead a ministry that, in addition to transport, innovation and technology, will also include the areas of climate protection, energy and the environment, and thus will really be the place in this government, which can also think and apply, across sectors, some of the central thresholds for climate protection together. That's what I'm looking forward to. At the heart of this additional energy area, however, will certainly be the successor to the Eco electricity Act, i.e. the expansion of renewable energies. We start in Austria from a good starting position, but we have a lot ahead of us. I do not think I have to explain in particular to the energy spokespersons of the parliamentary parties, the climate protection spokespersons and spokespersons, that the objective we have set ourselves here, namely the expansion of renewable energy to the extent of 27 terawatt hours, is an ambitious one, one that will move us to quick action and that we need to act quickly, but one that has real opportunities and for which there is really massive support in the population. Let us bear in mind that in the promotion we want to go from the stop-and-go to the ongoing expansion, especially as regards photovoltaics; I am addressing here the one-million roof photovoltaic program. There we can really develop climate protection close to people, close to the Austrians, because many are already there, and there is great potential that there are more people about renewable energy communities, about their photovoltaic plant at I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but I'm I think that is also one of the central levers to bring climate protection very close to the people. I look forward to working with you in the development of this law. We want to get it to the High House quickly. [[Congratulations with the Greens and representatives of the ÖVP.]] We have, of course, many more projects in this government programme in the field of climate protection and energy in addition to a new energy efficiency law with improved criteria. The phase-out for fossil energy sources in space heat was addressed. We will further develop this in dialogue with the federal states, the energy suppliers and the operators, because the exit from oil, coal and gas heating systems – and I can take up the discussion from the outset – is a future chance for Austria. It's also an opportunity for more justice, because I think one is clear: A well-renovated house heated or cooled with renewable energies is one that has significantly lower operating costs in the long term, and it is also a contribution to social justice if we are ambitious and courageous. [[Congratulation with Greens and ÖVP.]] As a result of the short period of time, I have now been able to mention only a few of the measures under the government programme in the field of climate change, energy, mobility and infrastructure. In the next few days and weeks, we will become very active especially in these areas and prepare the first measures and processes together with you, because I am really convinced that climate protection can only work together as a project. Therefore, from this point of view, I also invite all of you – to all members of the House, to the federal states, the cities, the municipalities, especially to the economy, the interests, the social partners, the science, civil society and the NGOs – to join us in shaping the project climate neutrality in 2040. I think it's a huge opportunity for our country. I am very looking forward to working together, I am very pleased to meet the challenge and I am pleased to join you in shaping the future of Austria in terms of climate protection and climate neutrality in 2040! Thank you very much."", ""(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Ladies and gentlemen! Climate change is the greatest challenge of our century. We don't know that just since the IPCC report, the special report that appeared a few days ago, but the results are still alarming. The last 20 years have been the warmest since the beginning of the series in 1850. The current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is the highest in three million years. And if we cannot stop global warming, then the serious effect on all of us, whether it be the expansion of heat periods, the severe rainfall or even a massive dryness, will increase all of that. We have already felt this especially this summer in Austria. That is why global action is urgently needed, and we, Austria in particular, must move forward. This is also the reason why, as one of our major first steps in January 2018, we, the Federal Government, launched the decision of the Austrian Climate and Energy Strategy, the #mission 2030. We have already decided on this integrated climate and energy strategy, which will be available for the first time in this form in Austria, at the end of May this year. This was one of the first projects that this government launched. That alone shows the importance we give to climate protection. We have put forward a comprehensive public participation, including a scientifically accompanied survey here in this House. With the strategy, we have hit the cornerstones of climate protection. The aim is to reduce emissions by around 36 percent by 2030. The #mission 2030 is now implemented step by step. You, Mr Rossmann, claimed that the strategy lacks measures, timetables and responsibilities: I would very much recommend that you read the decided copy again. That is exactly what the suggestions in the public participation process were, and that is what we have done. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Another thing we did: Not only have I worked on this climate and energy strategy as an Environment/Sustainability Minister, but we have worked across the board, and my most important partner was Transport Minister Hofer. We have agreed on twelve lighthouse projects, starting with e-mobility, the expansion of public transport, building renovation and renewable heat, and biogas and hydrogen from renewable energy and other technology innovations. By the end of the year, together with the federal states, which is also a very important point, we are preparing a national energy and climate plan. Together we define how our European energy and climate objectives are achieved. We have defined clear targets in the areas of space heating and mobility as the largest areas of action. There we have the greatest CO2 savings needed, for example in the field of transport 7 million tonnes and in the building area 3 million tonnes of CO2. One of the first measures – because you spoke about the absence of any measures; we have already implemented this – is that we have put the new oil promotion action out of oil. We also preferred these; planned the year 2019, but it was already started before the summer. This is a very concrete action in which anyone who changes his oil boiler for a renewable heating system gets a bonus of EUR 5,000 from the federal government. In addition, the country's funding is still available. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] It has never been so attractive to get out of oil heating. We still have around 700 000 oil heaters in Austria, many of which are very old. This is where we want to give priority to oil and renewables. One thing is also important: Large companies recognize the political signals. The OMC has announced that even as the largest oil group in the country, it will escape from the promotion of oil heating. We are thus blazing the end of the fossil age! [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] With regard to mobility, we have succeeded in launching an important package of incentives to improve clean mobility. Among other things, we will lift the so-called air hundreds for clean cars. In addition, we will allow the use of bus tracks by e-vehicles, thus giving them an advantage. Here too, we are taking an example of Norway, where precisely these measures have led to great success. The new registration rate is already 40 percent, and in Austria we are 2.5 percent. A next possible step would, for example, also be the exception from the obligation of vignette. But above all, we want to call on the cities and communities to give priority to e-mobiles, clean vehicles and, as is already the case in Graz, Linz and Klagenfurt, to free parking. Dear ladies and gentlemen! We want to be a pioneer, and we will do so in the electricity sector in particular. We want to produce electricity for national demand to 100 percent of renewable energy by 2030. Currently we are already at about 70 percent of the electricity consumption – and this without nuclear current! That is where we are in the forefront of Europe. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] I hope, Mr Rossmann, that you will now listen carefully: Just Sweden, which you always take as an example when it suits you, continues to produce electricity from nuclear energy. – We will not go this way either in the future! [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] [[Call the ÖVP:Aha!]] In total energy consumption, we will increase the share of renewables to 45 percent, and we will continue to pursue the objectives of the Energy Union consistently. Austria has very ambitious goals here, and we will be among the leaders worldwide. We therefore also want to put green electricity promotion on new legs. We will redefine and improve the framework conditions for the accelerated expansion of renewable energy. In the new Renewable Development Act, we will improve funding efficiency and focus on market premiums and investment promotions. The Renewable Development Act is the most extensive energy economic law project that will shape Austria in the next decades. That is why we have also agreed on a very ambitious schedule and are already working intensively with all stakeholders in the energy industry to implement it. The issue of sustainable procurement is also already decided and implemented. Of all the objectives we are working on, which we want to implement together with the countries and the communities, this is certainly also one of the very great ones that it really needs to be implemented. In the field of climate protection, the Federal Government will, in particular, set a good example for the public sector. We will change the procurement of the public sector in a sustainable way. A few days ago, we set out in the Council of Ministers the roadmap for this sustainable public procurement and consistently aligned it according to the objectives of the Climate and Energy Strategy. The potential is enormous, as the total public hand invests 45 billion euros per year. Only the example of the Federal Computers shows how much is possible here. When we switch the electronic supply to eco electricity, we save 8 800 tonnes of CO2 in the year or 3.5 million tonnes of oil. This is definitely a very good measure, with which the federal government can show that we are taking the right steps. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] A next important point is tax reform. The Federal Government has already stated in the coalition negotiations that there will be a major tax reform, which will be developed in 2019 and will enter into force in 2020. The focus of this tax reform will be the further discharge of Austrians. In addition, this tax reform will also contain environmental elements such as the removal of the own electricity tax for self-generated and consumed electricity. We are very deeply involved in the preparations and together with the Ministry of Finance we are working together on the basis of this reform. This may seem unusual to many, but we within this government understand each other in cooperation and not in the past. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] On the topic of a national CO2 tax raised by you and, for example, by colleagues from NEOS: We are the principle of discharge, not the burden on taxpayers. We know, I think, from the past already well enough that the simplest way, the tax increase, has always been chosen in Austria. This has also led us to see Austria as one of the countries with the highest tax rate in Europe. I am convinced that – please listen to me, Mr Bruno Rossmann! – that a CO2 tax within the meaning of a CO2 minimum price is only really useful at European level. [[Abg. Rossmann:...come-neutral!]] I am also very close to my colleagues, for example from France, and we are forcing the installation of a European CO2 minimum price since April of this year. We have taken the R20 summit as an opportunity to make an excuse for this, together with Arnold Schwarzenegger and other international sizes in the field of climate protection, and to bring them all to a table together. I am convinced – for example, my colleague from France gives us the right thing – that this will be the right way for the whole of Europe and not just for us here in Austria. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] Because you've already mentioned it: Another important example of action is CO2 reduction and thus fleet targets for cars by 2030. ==References== In October 2018, a very important success of negotiations was achieved at the Council of Environment Ministers by all newly approved cars having to show 35 percent lower emissions, as proposed by the EU Ministers. With this proposal, we have come to terms with many countries that wanted to take a much less ambitious path. The bandwidth was between 20 and 50 percent. I know that it has been said – including you – that this must be much higher, but I can also tell you quite clearly that Germany, for example, in Chancellor Merkel's person the day before, has called all the Heads of State and Government to plead for 30 percent. Our compromise has been reached after 14 hours of negotiation, it is also Germany on board, as well as Sweden, which is one of the most ambitious countries in this continent. In view of the Special Report of the World Climate Change on Global Warming by 1.5 degrees, I consider this agreement essential and extremely important. It is also particularly important for us to work together across the EU. That is exactly what we can do with these decisions. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] The same applies to our common position as regards the UN Climate Change Conference in Katowice. As the negotiator of the EU countries at the UN Climate Change Conference, it is particularly important to me that we join forces and that we are close to our agreed goals. At the climate conference in December, it will be a matter of meeting the objectives of the Paris Convention by regulating the numerous details of its implementation. The next week in Krakow will be the start of the negotiations of the Climate Change Conference, and Austria has a very special role to play by the EU Presidency. That's why I'm going to start a very extensive climate tour to win allies. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to vote with Prime Minister Lee from Singapore, who is currently chairing the Asean countries, as a joint approach between Europe and Asia. We are faced with the situation in which large states, I believe, too, you have to recognise this, or we want to get out of the Paris Agreement or question it, for example. This makes me very worried personally, and it really needs a network of ambitious countries with handshake quality. Austria and Europe will continue to be a leader in climate protection, and together with our European partners, we will be committed to the ambitious conclusion of the UN Climate Change Conference. Finally, allow me to say: What really bothers me in the last few days is the inaccurate political discourse and the choice of words, which you are showing above all. I strongly reject Austria as a disgrace when it comes to climate protection! [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] With this, Mr Deputies, you are mistaken and you deny the facts. Austria is currently in the middle of the 2020 targets, but in general in the target path. Countries like Germany, for example, have already quietly and quietly adopted the 2020 goals; quite unlike us. Compared to many countries, we have only just launched a climate and energy strategy right now, with mandatory targets for individual sectors, and we are top leaders in the field of renewable energy sources. [[Abg. Rossmann: CO2 emissions are already rising!]] I refer to your statements yesterday, Mr Rossmann, and I say quite clearly to you: We're doing climate policy with people. They want to make them against the people, we do them with the population. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] And one thing I'm telling you in all clarity: We need to see climate protection as an opportunity to move forward the energy transition in order to stimulate innovation, as an opportunity for more investment and, above all, for strengthening the competitiveness of our economy. We must not forget one thing: People need to be taken with them in terms of climate protection. This must be our common concern to make people aware that there is something to do here for each individual. We want to make climate protection the largest initiative and movement in this country and not just talk, but above all act."", ""(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) High house! I believe that climate change and its consequences and effects have really arrived in Austria at the latest since the last summer, summer 2018. Building on the last years was especially dry the last summer and hot as never before. We had massive harvest losses, including decreases in the water area and massive pests. These are just a few noticeable consequences. The agriculture and forestry sector in particular is heavily affected in Austria. We are rightly talking about the climate crisis as one of the biggest global challenges of our time. One thing is also quite clear to say: Any support in the fight against climate change is correct and important because it helps to increase the attention of this issue and to address the solutions more closely. Yes, I think it is good that young people deal so intensely with this issue that they also respond to their concerns. Fridays for Future makes it visible that climate protection is a movement based on Greta Thunberg, who is now also present all over the world. One thing is clear: The Federal Government takes the pupils of Fridays for Future seriously. Climate protection is important to us. I also had the opportunity to discuss these issues in a personal discussion with some of the initiators. In any case, we share one goal: This is the reduction of CO2 emissions. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] If you, Mrs Cox – I really welcome the fact that we are dealing with this issue this afternoon – but call for concrete measures, I must ask you if you have the opportunity to take part in votes, to assume this responsibility as well. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] We have an up-to-date issue, which I would like to address, namely the eco-stromnovel: Biomass power plants must be removed from the grid due to the expiry of the tariff This is the first time that we have been able We could have created, together with a constitutional majority here in the house, the basis for a transition into a rather simple procedure until the Renewable Development Act came into force. This concerns highly efficient plants, which are now in operation and which must then be removed from the network. You, too, have not taken this responsibility and have voted against this transitional arrangement. Yesterday in the Council of Ministers, we were led by a new law of principle, and we will put it into nine implementing laws, because this is really a concern for us as a federal government. It is not enough simply to demand climate change and to vote against any small measure here in this House. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] The same is done by the SPÖ. It would have been relatively easy to vote in the Federal Council for the interests of the federal states, to vote in favour of the interests of biomass power plants, to vote in favour of the interests of the eco electricity in that country and simply to agree so that we can create a transitional solution. We've started this ourselves now, and within a very short time we've set up a basic biomass law, and we're going to implement it so that we don't lose any investment. That's what it's all about! You cannot take permanent action on the one hand and then, as I said, always oppose it. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] You all know, and I would like to say quite clearly: As the first measure in my Federal Ministry, we have developed the joint integrated climate and energy strategy #mission 2030 – with a broad process of civil participation, with a parliamentary survey here in this House, with scientists, with all parties, in order to really have a starting point for how we can tackle this energy transition, this transformation of the economy in order to achieve our climate and energy goals. It is the long-term conversion of our energy system. We want to convert the power supply to 100 percent for renewable energy by 2030. That's going to be fixed. In particular, the Renewable Extension Act, which will be available until the summer, will provide important impulses so that we can succeed. This is also the key word: Sector coupling, especially Greening the Gas, to bring the fossil fuels out of our cycle and replace them with renewables. That's our goal. My vision is that in the future every house in Austria can be a power plant that produces the energy itself in an integrated energy and economic cycle, 100 percent renewable, and thus can make a real and important contribution to climate protection. [[Congratulations at the FPÖ.]] We visited Denmark this week with a delegation from Members of this House, and we looked at how this energy transition is being carried out in Denmark. Denmark is a pioneer in many areas. We have a common goal that we share: 100 percent electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030. We have looked at different projects, especially network development, of course a very crucial issue if we are serious about the energy transition. One thing we all noticed very quickly: The very big difference between Austria and Denmark is that in Denmark there is absolute unity between society, parties, the economy and industry, that this expansion of renewable energy is indispensable, that we must do everything we can to achieve this 100 percent in terms of energy consumption. To create renewables really so that we can get rid of nuclear energy in Europe, so that we can get away from coal stream in particular. That's the difference with Austria, and that's what we're going to take to Austria in particular. There we still have, I think, the biggest chunks to deal with, so that we all have the same goal. Austria now covers more than 70 percent of electricity from renewable sources, without nuclear power. We are ahead of many countries and simply show in all sense that this is very well done. With regard to nuclear energy in Europe, we as the Federal Government have long been fighting for a change of course. There must not be a renaissance of nuclear power development in Europe under the cover of climate protection – and that must be stated clearly. That would be completely the wrong way. As a federal government, we really are against this. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] We have filed complaints against the expansion of the Hinkley-Point-C power plant in Great Britain. We complain of Paks II in Hungary. We want the Euratom Treaty to be revised to make it clear that, above all, we are also making the most of Brexit as an opportunity to revise the Euratom Treaty. [[Congratulation of the Abg. Neubauer]] We were recently in Slovakia, I met my colleagues, especially with regard to the commissioning of the Mochovce nuclear power plant. This too is a very crucial and important point. There are massive concerns about safety standards. These are the really central issues we are dealing with here. Also very important: In order for us to succeed in this active climate protection, so that we can also succeed in the energy transition, the building area plays a really crucial role. We have the goal of saving 3 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over this area. We are currently also developing a common heat strategy with the federal states, which are largely responsible for it. We are also implementing measures from the climate and energy strategy, which include the exit from fossil energy sources. A concrete measure, Mrs Cox, is the out-of-the-oil bonus. We have now paid more than 25 million euros to replace the 700 000 oil heaters that we still operate in Austria with renewable energy systems. Each Austrian receives 5 000 euros when it comes to a renewable energy system and rises from fossil oil. This is also a concrete measure that we have preferred, which we are already implementing and in which our federal states are really active, good partners. That's where we're already seeing the numbers that something is going to change. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] The biggest area and the biggest challenge we see is mobility. We have seen in the 2016 greenhouse gas balance, which is available to us, that the figures are falling, particularly in the economic and industrial sectors. In the agricultural sector, we also saw in the greenhouse gas balance a minus ahead of the figures in 2017, but especially the mobility sector is a huge topic. In the last year, the Federal Government has also begun to act in concrete terms. We have launched an e-mobility package, which is not just about promoting financial nature, but about which it has been important for us to provide general incentives. We want free parking for e-mobility in Austria to be enabled, we want to open bus tracks – just as Norway did this mobility turn. We have decided an exception for the IG-L that we have now taken e-vehicles on the trail. Together with Federal Minister Hofer, we have launched a mobility package of 93 million euros, with which the changeover to clean mobility really takes place. This involves not only e-mobility, but also hydrogen. So we're also trying to roll new technologies out of the red carpet. Loading infrastructure and the like is also part of it. Because you've been talking about concrete measures: We have used the Council Presidency massively for climate protection. A Europe that protects was the motto of the Federal Government; a Europe that protects climate was the motto of my house. We have negotiated a total of four Council formations and have decided and implemented climate change measures in each area; they have also been confirmed by the European Parliament this week. The most impressive example is the reduction of 37.5% CO2 emissions in cars by 2030. Do you know what that means? – An annual savings of 180 million tonnes of CO2, more than double the total emissions of Austria. This is a result that can really be presented under Austrian Presidency! [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] We have also succeeded in anchoring a massive CO2 reduction not only for the cars, but also for heavy traffic. Trucks, freight transport is one of the main issuers and factors, we see this also in all greenhouse gas balances. The CO2 reduction will have to be 30 percent by 2030. – This too is a success of this Austrian Presidency. In the transport sector, we really have a lot to do. I believe that a solution is a key to public transport. In the course of the #mission 2030, the competent Federal Minister Hofer has also undertaken to save 7.2 million tonnes in the transport sector – we have jointly worked out this. Public transport will be a major part of the solution. The Minister takes in EUR 2.3 billion to invest massively in the ÖBB, to expand networks to make public transport cheaper in the future. The possibility of not having to change to the car, but also of coming from the rural areas to the conurbation centres and returning again should be offered. This is active climate protection. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] Ladies and gentlemen! As has already been said, agriculture is above all the main victims of climate change. We are now suffering massive damage. Agriculture will also contribute to climate protection. In the next CAP reform, we will also make it clear that there are package of measures that will also help agriculture to contribute to climate protection. The rural family farms in Austria are part of the solution and not part of the problem. Our farms are partly in massive competition with huge international agricultural groups. As a result, the grip on regional, seasonal agricultural products produced in Austria is an absolute contribution to more climate protection, something everyone can do. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] But above all we want to start in the ground area. One of the most important storage media we have on CO2 is soil fertility. We want to start, above all, in the context of the CAP reform, so that on the one hand, we can also support agricultural holdings more strongly, but on the other hand, we also want agriculture to make an active contribution to climate protection. Another important issue is my particular concern: the reduction of plastic. Plastic is an important material, but not if it is used once, especially when it contributes to the pollution of the seas and the environment. The raw material of plastic, of plastic is oil, thus also a massive CO2 source. As the Federal Government, we have a comprehensive package to reduce plastic waste in preparation. The ban on plastic carrier bags was, in fact, for almost decades a requirement that we have now taken into account. This is an equivalent of 7 000 tons of plastic, which can thus be saved. One thing is quite clear: We do not want this to be replaced by a one-way alternative, but the keyword of the future is several-way. Each product must be used several times, but above all it must also be added to a fabric cycle. The completion of the real circular economy in Austria is essential. We must not waste anything more, but everything must simply be used again as a resource, as a raw material. However, the ban on plastic sacks is not enough. We want to ban 25 percent of the packaging plastic, save it and thus bring about a significant CO2 reduction again. The topic of microplastics is also very important to us. We are negotiating at European level. If this does not result in a uniform, rapid decision, we will generally ban microplastics in production in Austria. There is also a very clear goal: This will take place by 2020. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] They have raised a number of points that we are currently dealing with very intensively: Tax reform. In this respect, the Minister of Finance has already announced that, at the first stage of the tax reform, which is a key issue for the discharge of the low-earners, the beneficiary of low-income income in Austria, there will also be ecological components that will present this federal government. We have already enshrined in the climate and energy strategy a lot that will really help us to: Elimination of own electricity tax. For the purpose of producing energy you should not also pay taxes in the future, but it should also be an incentive to move towards a renewable energy system. We want to get a lot on the way here, which actually makes a difference. [[Congratulations with ÖVP and FPÖ.]] Make a difference on the subject: Last year, we took the R20 summit, the Austrian World Summit, to look at ourselves together with the French, which we can achieve on controls at European level. I am an absolute champion of a CO2 minimum price at European level. I do not think any of national CO2 taxes, because that would be far too small in the steering effect. To have competitiveness in order to make a real difference, we need common European solutions. I would really like this Fridays-for-future movement to bring exactly what we have been trying for a year to anchor a CO2 minimum price at European level, so that there are the same rules for our economic and industrial location, so that there are the same rules for companies, so that, above all, significant CO2 is actually saved throughout Europe. We are moving forward on this issue. We have been able to win the Danes in the last few days to work together at European level. You see, honourable Mrs Cox, the #mission 2030 is already in implementation, is already on the way. We work every day, every week in the Council of Ministers, to implement it continuously. I can also deliver a very good message to you today, really also a success: In the overall ranking 2019 of the global energy transition index of the Word Economic Forum Austria is now sixth place. That's an improvement of two places. This shows that our commitment is now also reflected in figures. One thing is quite clear: Climate protection must not be a burden, but it is our system, our economic system, to transform our society in the long term, to save CO2, to reduce CO2, to bring CO2 really out of our economic system, but also in line with a wealth in society, with social justice and also with prosperity in Austria. That's our goal. I believe that we will actually succeed together. The #mission 2030 provides an excellent basis for this. - Thank you.""]","<|system|>

Energy law, and a strategy dating back to 2009 should be replaced. and observes the period until 2020. That is why the energy minister has given the order to approach the creation of a new document, and has formed a Committee for Drafting a proposal for a strategy for the energy development of the Republic of Croatia, led by it itself. Energy development strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030 with a view to 2050. It is primarily committed to decarbonising energy, which is also a common EU objective agreed by the Paris Agreement. This common objective is further highlighted by the European Green Plan, which has very clearly articulated the ambition of the new European Commission, which aims towards decarbonisation, decarbonised Europe by 2050. It is therefore clear, on behalf of the new strategy, that it covers the period until 2030, but is considering and looking at the challenges and potentials in the long term until 2050. The basis of the document is closely linked to a package known as Clean Energy for All Europeans, this legislative package defines 5 main pillars of EU energy development, which are reducing energy consumption, reducing CO2 emissions from the energy sector, energy security, integration into the single EU market, and promoting research and development. The new Croatian strategy is in line with the EU's 2030 targets, defines optimal energy mix, and outlines the vision of the development of the energy sector of the Republic of Croatia. Therefore, the main starting points of the new strategy were to satisfy 3 essential elements. The first is a growing flexibility and sustainable energy production, the second is a better connection between energy infrastructure and the third is more energy efficiency. We are seeking to encourage new projects with a focus on renewable-source projects and better use of existing capacities for production, transport and storage of energy. This can only be achieved by investing in new capacities and infrastructure, which will be based primarily on low-carbon technologies2. The increase in domestic energy production requires the development of new infrastructure and alternative supply routes that will enable better integration of infrastructure both within the country and with our neighbours. We also plan to replace the expected increase in energy demand to a greater extent the energy efficiency in consumption. As in the EU, we aim to break the link between the development of society by increasing the use of energy resources. The development of the strategy has therefore been approached with the aim of establishing a path towards achieving a vision of low-carbon energy and ensuring a responsible transition to a new period of common energy and climate policy, ensuring affordable and stable energy supply, and protecting the climate by supporting the growth of Croatian companies and their involvement in the international energy market. Although it will be an important goal of decarbonisation, which brings with it the transformation of the energy system, they must continue to meet their basic purpose, which is a secure supply of energy to all customers at acceptable prices and with minimal environmental impact. It should be stressed that the strategy sees energy transition as an opportunity for the development of domestic industry through increased investment in innovation in the field of the protection of air quality, environment and general health of people while increasing the competitiveness of the economy in the area of decarbonisation and the development of renewable energy sources. We believe that, from the point of view of environmental protection, the energy development strategy is very advanced because it follows the EU's objectives with an ambitious path towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It gives a clear view of the future that is in line with the Green Agreement for Europe, which was presented last December by the new European Commission. Prior to the creation of the strategy document itself, extensive analyses resulting in the production of the Green and White Paper have been made available. This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union. The first draft of the Green Paper was presented, which very detailedly processed all the elements needed to strategically outline the development of the energy sector. The same highlighted needs, potentials and problems and opportunities of Croatian energy, and after extensive and thorough public debates, this document ended, and the same White Paper came out, it was first presented to the general public in March last year, the White Paper summarised a number of analytical data, and after the public debate and the completion of the paper became the basis for the development of the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia by 2030. With a 2050 view. An important part of the strategy makes a chapter dedicated to the measures resulting from the strategic environmental impact assessment process. A strategic environmental impact study, as well as the strategy itself, was conducted during a public debate between 20 May and 20 June 2019. on the e-consultation portal and on the website of the Ministry of Environment and Energy Protection. The public debate received written indications of 24 state bodies, institutions and associations, 2 natural persons, while 174 comments were received on the e-consultation portal. All comments, proposals and comments have been taken into account and have been processed after the end of the public debate and have responded to the proposals, observations and comments with reasons for their acceptance or non-acceptation, after which the mandaters have made changes and complemented the strategic study, and the draft strategy itself has been adapted to the comments received. It is evident from the above that the process of drawing up a new strategy has been led in detail and transparently. The Green Paper, the White Paper, as well as the strategy presented three basic scenarios of future energy development. The first of these is the zero scenario of development with the application of existing measures, which represents the continuity of the current energy policy and the application of existing measures. The second scenario is one or more scenarios of the accelerated energy transition, starting from the assumption that at international level, and especially at EU Member States, there is strong co-operation in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This claim is reflected in the global availability of the necessary technologies, the reduction of specific renewable energy costs and the management of market mechanisms in creating favourable conditions for the wide use of renewable energy sources and the application of energy efficiency. At all levels of transmission production, distribution, energy consumption is expected to accelerate energy efficiency through advanced technology measures and synergy horizontal contributions across all sectors of human action. When using different forms of energy, the capacity of the eco-system, the development of the circular economy, increased competitiveness and the development of economic branches that directly contribute to the realisation of the objectives of low.../incomprehensible/development. The scenario of two and a scenario of moderate energy transition, which by all main characteristics is similar to the scenario of accelerated energy transition but with lower energy recovery targets of buildings, lower electricity consumption rates, slightly smaller, smaller portfolio of newly built wind power plants, solar power plants and gas power plants, slower applications in the transport sector and slower transition in the economy. The resulting scenario S two is less demanding investment, requires less operational costs to balance the system with respect to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it should be stressed as in the short-term planning period until 2030 the scenario S one and S two very similar to the key indicators. The difference occurs during the long-term planning period i.e. by 2050 where the scenario S one contributes to a greater reduction in emissions, a greater energy recovery of buildings, a greater share of electric hybrid vehicles in road transport, and a greater share of renewable energy sources in the production and consumption of energy. The strategy also brings financial, economic and economic indicators. They show that the development of the energy sector is ultimately profitable and decarbonisation opens new opportunities in the economy. Total investments were estimated between 378 and 461 billion kuna i.e. 12.5 to 15 billion kuna a year. Of these, more intense investments range from 14 billion to 17 billion in the period from 2031 to 2050, about 12 to 15 billion kuna. Analysis also shows that the implementation of all measures would lead to the rise of all major macroeconomic indicators in the Republic of Croatia. With an estimated annual investment of 16.8 billion kuna between 2021 and 2030, it is expected to increase gross domestic product between 2.5% and 3% annually. In the period considered, with regard to the level of GDP from 2018, i.e. about 11 billion kuna per year. The increase in gross added value is also expected between 2.5% and 3% annually in the period considered, given the level of 2018 and around 9.4 billion kuna per year respectively. The strategy also envisions an increase in the number of employees between 50 and 100,000 by 2030, bringing with it an increase in tax revenues of around 1.6 billion kuna per year. Therefore, the strategy foresees a process of energy transition that will be capital intensive and with the expected higher private capital involvement in the financing of projects, especially those related to renewable energy sources, and is thought of as means, that is to say, the assets of interested companies, the funds of financial institutions and the funds of funds, including pension funds. In addition to private investment, EU funding from the Cohesion Policy Programme and other programmes such as the innovation, modernisation or fair transition fund opened to us and planned for the next financial perspective in the EU budget will be committed. The last two funds are closely linked to the funds collected from the auction of emission units and CO2 emission charges. Therefore, an ambitious investment plan should be achieved through the use of both private and public funds, but public funding will put emphasis on available projects that have a decarbonisation effect and will promote renewable energy sources. The Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia until 2030, with a view to 2050, is ambitious on the development of clean energy. What can be expected, and what is in line with the European Green Agreement, is an increase in targets by 2030. In this context, with regard to renewable energy sources, Croatia has clearly shown strong support and ambition. It is important to stress that the strategy, although developed prior to the presentation of the European Green Plan, is made possible by considering decarbonisation of the energy sector fully in line with this. For all of this, I ask this esteemed House to adopt the Energy Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia by 2030 with a view to 2050 and to take the first step to ensure the decarbonisation of Croatian energy with clear and positive macroeconomic effects for the Republic of Croatia. Thank you for your attention."", ""Dear Vice President of the Croatian Parliament. My colleagues and colleagues, the esteemed secretary of state with an associate. As regards the proposal for a strategy for energy development by the Republic of Croatia by 2030, with a view to 2050, we and myself, on behalf of the HSS Club at the beginning, say that we cannot accept such a proposal for a strategy for the energy development of the Republic of Croatia for a number of reasons, because this strategy should, above all, allow RH for energy stability, independence, availability, acceptable prices and allow for development and new jobs in the context of European policies and in the context of the objectives of preventing climate change and environmental protection. This proposal for a strategy was done approximately two years ago, there were a number of public and professional debates, and here a few months ago here in the procedure for us in the Parliament, and parallel discussions were held within the European Commission. We have experienced or witnessed terrible climate change from floods in Europe to fires in Australia, and we simply need to be aware that we need to respond more quickly and quality to these challenges. The strategy must respond to the production of carbon-free energy, we believe that this strategy is conservative in all three proposed scenarios because it does not meet the objectives set by the European Commission or the strategy is not in line with the European Green Plan. The European Green Plan was presented on 11 December 2019 by the European Commission and describes how by 2050 it will be. Europe becomes the first climate neutral continent and how to boost the economy, improve health and quality of life, protect nature, and do not neglect anyone. The European Green Plan is a strategy to achieve the sustainability of the EU economy by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities for the development of a sustainable economy that covers all sectors of the economy, in particular transport, energy, agriculture, maintenance and building of buildings and industry. This strategy, which is ahead of us of the energy development of the Republic of Croatia by 2030, with a view to 2050, does not respect this fact and therefore the HSS cannot support it and we are looking for a new strategy in line with the European Commission's Green Plan to follow it. This strategy is not in line with the EU's objectives and does not go towards reducing energy consumption through increasing energy efficiency and increasing the share of energy from renewable energy sources. This proposal for a strategy for energy development of the Republic of Croatia takes into account only a small part of the potential and resources of renewable energy sources in Croatia. The emphasis has not been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the period until 2050, in accordance with the Paris Agreement, eu targets or meeting the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. The proposal for a strategy did not take into account the necessary increase in energy efficiency as a measure which can mostly reduce the consumption of heat, cooling and electricity in the general consumption of household, service sector, agriculture and construction. The strategy should clearly include renewable energy sources in a way that promotes the production of electricity from renewable energy sources at the energy consumption site to the power of the connection where electricity will be produced primarily for its own consumption, and only the excess energy is delivered to the electromagnetic grid, but for the accounting period of one calendar year and is calculated by a two-way number of electricity. The distribution system operator is increasingly expected to provide and create conditions on the electricity market for the active inclusion of small consumers. It is certainly necessary to seek to increase the share of renewable energy sources, but without special incentives that would burden our citizens, taxpayers like this through renewable energy sources, through wind power plants, etc. In the context of the development of Croatia's energy, we should use our geostrategic position and develop renewable energy sources and technology through the transfer of knowledge to the neighbouring countries, which is not in the strategy at all. The Republic of Croatia, although in a far better geographical position with respect to the air of solar radiation compared to other EU countries, does not use enough solar radiation energy to obtain heat, cooling and electricity. The share of electricity coverage produced from solar power plants in the EU countries in 2019 was about 5% on average, and in Croatia it is only 0.4%. If Croatia had that share of 5% of total consumption then in Croatia 800 megawatts of solar power plants should already be installed, and unfortunately we only have 54 megawatts. How and when to achieve those goals? The use of solar energy is of local importance and leads to the achievement of new jobs, so these are these new green jobs that are talked about and invested in rural areas, areas of special state care, coastal areas, coastal areas, islands, these are, there are jobs that are most needed, and certainly there would be cheaper production of energy and cheaper production of all other products. Finally, Croatia reduces imports of electricity and greenhouse gas emissions. The citizens of Croatia would become richer, and new jobs of local character in the production, design, installation, control, release, maintenance, marketing and promotion of solar and thermal and photovoltaic systems will be opened in terms of the economy. Unfortunately that is this, here in the strategy it is not sufficiently highlighted and that is why we are against, and especially when it comes to agriculture, the production of electricity from biomass. It is crucial that we achieve those objectives in general that agriculture is a strategic branch, that we want to achieve food production in the Republic of Croatia enough for our own needs, and we have the potential to export and precisely in those productions where we can hardly monitor trends and prices, costs of production such as that in the production of milk, the production of electricity on such farms through biomass production would compensate for those losses in the production of milk and would not happen as it is now that in 2019 we only have 4,687 milk suppliers, and in 2013, we had more than 11,000. The fall is huge and it must be stopped because then there are new jobs and food production and consumer protection, and then it is a demographic measure because there would be people living in those areas. This must be better and better developed in both the strategy and the action plan announced as an implementing act of this strategy, and I think we must all finally understand that the production of food by us from HSS is as important as the production of energy, and that in cooperation with each other there can create preconditions for the continuation and production of milk and other types of food production currently lacking on the market in the Republic of Croatia. We see what Russia did when it turned to strategic food production, that they raised levels of production and cereals and milk and vegetables and now exporting over $25 billion, over the last year billions of dollars have increased agricultural exports. So it can be if it's targeted and planned to invest in agriculture, and that's how we keep our space and keep people in that space. Then it's both a real economic and a demographic measure. Gas, as an energy, is certainly welcome and I must mention the resistance that was at the construction of LNG terminals in Omislj, Krk, that more should be respected in the very energy projects of thought and profession but also in the opinion of the people living in those areas and that certainly after such projects, energy should not be collected to Croatian citizens and Croatian craftsmen and entrepreneurs, but the announcements are just the opposite that in the next moment and the price of gas, and also electricity should probably go up. And it should also be in the strategy to predict how, that's what, to afford our economy and our citizens that energy. When it comes to INI, it is also an important energy company in the Republic of Croatia and should be returned to ownership of the Republic of Croatia. This government has promised it, I don't know if there's anything further going on, but here's the fact that it's been promised, and nothing that's currently going on to close and reduce production or not in Sisak, that the workers are being fired, and the latest is that on other plants, workers are being forced into the Employment Office with some minimum consignors, and even here's one worker with eight children who announced that they're breaking up work relations with him. Here, it's such a company, we'll have problems at the Employment Service through social measures and the need to pay off, and INI and the Hungarian government remain profits. That's how much the government takes care of that economic operator. And when it comes to hydropotential, we are like a country rich in water, we have a good hydropotential, but we use it poorly, and especially when it comes to small hydrocentrals up to, we have power up to 10 megawatts in the Republic of Croatia built only 13, and for example, Slovenia has 600, Austria 4,000. Why is that? Entrepreneurs say because of administrative barriers and here in the strategy to say it needs to be reduced and solved administrative barriers, but the fact is that it is not done and that entrepreneurs who have capital give up investment because they simply can't wait to get 100 of what kind of documents and papers, while investment stands and capital costs. So, under urgent change of approach, especially when it comes to Croatia's electricity industry, which behaves as a monopolies and often stops such investments. That's a public and fair thing to say. And just if we manage to solve these administrative barriers there will certainly be new investments in both hydropotential and biomass electricity production, but surely Croatia's chance of building a solar energy system and that we can do the most and of course encourage the local and our economy to adapt to these industries and through secondary education create the preconditions that we have as many installers as possible of such systems and workers on maintenance and thus keep jobs both in Slavonia and on islands to finally take advantage of what God has given us because the generations that are coming will not forgive us if we do not do so now. Thank you very much."", 'Thank you very much, dear Vice President. I welcome once again the Secretary of State and my associate and, of course, all my colleagues and colleagues. So, before us is the Energy Development Strategy by 2030 with a view to 2050. I\'m going to take out a few preliminary figures so we can follow this important topic more easily. In Croatia the share of consumption and coal and crude oil decreases while natural gas, renewable energy and electricity imports are growing. It is similar in EU Member States where we have a decline in the share of fossil fuels. The Republic of Croatia is calming down on average 50% of its primary energy needs while the rest of the imports and these imports of energy grow year by year. We import 100% of coal, over 80% of oil and oil derivatives, close to 60% of gas and about 33% of electricity, which, of course, depends on the hydrological conditions of that year. Thus, the Republic of Croatia has become highly import-oriented in terms of energy and this stands at cca 10 billion kuna depending on the prices of the market. Let\'s look at some of the external factors that are important to mention here. We had a new EU energy regulation package titled ""Clear Energy for All Europeans"", we had a dependence on energy imports and an appropriate energy mix, we have cross-border interconnections and alternative energy supply routes, of course we need more integration into the single European market. We also have targets until 2030. 32% of gross direct consumption from renewable energy sources, 32.3% of energy efficiency improvements and 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. But we also have a 2050 goal of ensuring conditions for the climatic neutron continent, which we know already corresponds to approximately a 95% reduction in emissions. What energy strategy should Croatia bring today? The proposal for the Energy Development Strategy by 2030 can be said to be immediately very conservative and is not in line with the EU\'s objectives and does not go in the direction of reducing energy consumption through increasing energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy. This proposal of the Energy Development Strategy only took a small part into account the potential and resources of renewable energy sources in Croatia. The emphasis has not been placed on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the period until 2050, in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the EU objectives, i.e. the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This is also inconsistencies with the European Green Plan, which Europe wants to settle or become a climatic neuteral continent by 2050. We have one absurd in this strategy, despite the remarks we had on both the Green and White Book, the waste energy. Completely wrong waste energy is listed as a renewable energy source, it is not. So the amount that is now listed is 13.54 to 17.27 petajoules per year. Of course you\'re thinking of waste fuel. Which corresponds to a large amount could be over a million tonnes of yearly fuel from waste obviously still relying on the 2005 strategy as some kind of relevant document. It\'s definitely part of this waste, it\'s plastic waste that\'s fossil origin and it\'s not properly methodological to quote it as a renewable energy source. So it\'s not right. However, here I am going to make a concrete proposal immediately and that is one of the measures that connects horizontally different policies, because my previous speakers here called for us to be concrete, and how to convert waste into valuable energy. There\'s a solution, so it\'s worth energy and it\'s a renewable type, and that\'s recycling. Instead of those million tonnes of CGO fuel, this waste paper, cardboard and textiles can be recycled, a new product can be created and energy savings can be achieved. So it\'s raising energy efficiency in the industry. The potential is almost 35 petajoules, which is several times more than the energy recovery you insist on pushing as renewable energy sources. It\'s practically free of harmful emissions because that energy is reduced somewhere, so it\'s extremely valuable. It\'s also part of the Green Plan he\'s talking about, and so is your minister and prime minister. So that would be it, and here it\'s completely misunderstood and interpreted. The proposal for a strategy did not necessarily take into account the necessary increase in energy efficiency as a measure that can mostly reduce the consumption of heat cooling electricity in general consumption, such as households, service sector, agriculture and construction. The strategy does not clearly promote distributed electricity production at the site of consumption, and in the context of implementing energy efficiency measures in construction, so photovoltaic systems, thermal solar collectors, etc., which would be necessary, for example, not to mention the construction of approximately zero consumption, buildings of approximately zero energy consumption. The strategy should clearly include renewable energy sources in a way that promotes the production of electricity from renewable energy sources at the point of energy consumption to the power of the connection where electricity will be produced primarily for its own consumption, and only the excess energy is delivered to the power grid, the accounting period should be one year. The distribution system operator is increasingly expected to provide on the electricity market and create conditions for active inclusion of small producers or consumers, the name prosumers is used in English today, should certainly seek to increase the share of renewable energy sources, but without specific incentives that would burden final customers\' accounts. In order to create a stable business environment, and with regard to the implementation of the project, there must be clear and unequivocal regulatory regulations in which the spatial development of the Republic of Croatia, the low-carbon development strategy of the Republic of Croatia, the strategy for mitigation and adaptation to climate change, and the Natura 2000 ecological network area, along with the compromise of various constraints and the greater social benefits. In the context of energy development and the Republic of Croatia should take advantage of its geostrategic position and develop renewable energy sources and offer this technology through the transfer of knowledge to neighbouring countries, so far the untapped potential of the Republic of Croatia is large. Transport as an important sector has been very poorly processed, many measures have been missed which can be made in the transport sector, at least in principle, public transport electricity obligations, parking obligations for electric chargers, electrical chargers’ equipment, foreign car import restrictions, the promotion of low-emission zones in cities and many other similar ones. The energy of the sun deserves a special analysis, a special review of the Republic of Croatia, although in a far better geographical position than the radiation energy of sunlight, it does not use enough solar energy compared to other EU countries. The share of electricity coverage produced from solar power plants in the EU countries in 2019 was 5%, and in the Republic of Croatia only 0.34%, this means that given today\'s 56 megawatts of installed power to reach this average, we should immediately jump to 750. For the Republic of Croatia and our pro-energy system are of the importance of a small solar power plant to the power of building connections or covering their own energy consumption, such systems could be installed by 2030 without any influence on the network. 1500 megawatt power, they would annually produce 1875 gigawat hours of clean electricity without greenhouse gases, which is 10% of our consumption, or a good part of imports. The use of solar energy is of local importance and leads to the opening of many jobs and investments in rural areas, areas of special state care, the coast, the coast and islands. Finally, the Republic of Croatia reduces imports of electricity from greenhouse gas emissions, the citizens of the Republic of Croatia are becoming richer, and new jobs of local character in production, design, installation, control, release, maintenance, marketing, promotion of solar, thermal and photovoltaic systems are being achieved. It is worth mentioning a good example, the island of Krk, we have already learned to listen to about the island of Krk as an environment that progresses, which is mentioned in a very good light as it is in waste management, but this is also the case in energy. It has been known, at least, that in 2012 the island of Krk decided on a low-carbon strategy and the goal of achieving climate neutrality until 2030, therefore it is more ambitious than Europe, which is also logical because we are in a very favourable geostrategic position, but this strategy does not outline such ambition at all, so this is very good for Krk, but it is unfortunate for the Republic of Croatia that this strategy is not nearly as ambitious as we see it is the case in our advanced regions. All in all and in conclusion, this strategy of energy development cannot be supported, is that it is much better than the one from 2009 without further ado, but it is still given the present moment, backward, unambitious, inconsistent with the times and challenges that are ahead of society and energy today and I have to repeat the question, how is it that the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister, as well as the Minister, are so warmly advocating and mentioning the Green European agreement in which, or at least, I am reading it, see one attachment to the idea of putting Europe at the head of today\'s world and ensuring the first climatic continent on the Globe and thus being the leader of an avalanche of change because this avalanche is necessary. So, the energy sector of Europe as such today is a small greenhouse gas distributor, which is, I think, less than 10%, and it is still falling, the only continent that has managed to reduce emissions in almost all sectors compared to the last period except in transport as opposed to the other part of the world. However, this is no reason for us to say no, no, so it is better to be conservative because economic opportunities not only in developed countries but also in Croatia, because we need to know that the equipment for photovoltaic systems is almost entirely produced in Croatia, so this is an economic chance for us to create a system that will become sustainable and that will be able to provide equally good opportunities for life for generations to come. Thank you very much.']","<|system|>

This Government have honoured the clearly expressed wish of the British people. Their instruction to us, their servants, to secure our departure from the EU has been followed. The votes of 17.4 million people—more than have ever voted for any democratic proposition in our history—were implemented on 31 January and we are now on a new journey. As a sovereign, self-governing, independent nation, we will have the freedom to frame our own laws, control our own borders, lower all our taxes, set our own tariffs, determine our own trade relationships, and ensure that we follow the people’s priorities on security, the economy, and democratic accountability. Over the next nine months, we will negotiate a new relationship with our friends and partners in the EU based on free trade and friendly co-operation. We have today published the approach for these negotiations, and copies of the document, “The Future Relationship with the EU”, were made available to Members in the Vote Office from 9.30 am Talks with the EU on our future relationship begin next week. It is our aim to secure a comprehensive free trade agreement as well as agreement on questions such as fisheries, internal security and aviation. We are confident that those negotiations will lead to outcomes that work for both the UK and the EU, but this House, our European partners, and, above all, the British people should be in no doubt: at the end of the transition period on 31 December, the United Kingdom will fully recover its economic and political independence. We want the best possible trading relationship with the EU, but in pursuit of a deal, we will not trade away our sovereignty The Government’s vision for the UK’s future relationship with the EU was outlined with crystal clarity by the Prime Minister during the general election campaign, and the election result comprehensively confirmed public support for our direction of travel. In his speech in the Painted Hall in Greenwich on 3 February, the Prime Minister laid out in detail how we will reach our destination. The first principle of our approach is that we wish to secure a relationship based on friendly co-operation between sovereign equals. We respect the EU’s sovereignty, autonomy and distinctive legal order, and we expect it to respect ours. We will not accept or agree to any obligations where our laws are aligned with the EU or the EU’s institutions, including the Court of Justice. Instead, each party will respect the other’s independence and the right to manage its own borders, immigration policy and taxes The second and allied principle of our approach is that we will seek to emulate and build on the types of relationship that the EU already has with other independent sovereign states. We will use precedents already well established and well understood to ensure that both sides’ sovereignty is respected. By using already existing precedents, we should be able to expedite agreement. We will seek functional arrangements that the EU will recognise from its many other relationships. Our proposal draws on existing EU agreements such as the comprehensive economic and trade agreement with Canada, the EU-Japan economic partnership agreement and the EU-South Korea free trade agreement. That approach should enable us to move swiftly towards the goal envisaged in the political declaration agreed last October, in which both sides set the aim of concluding a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement As well as concluding a full FTA, we will require a wholly separate agreement on fisheries. We will take back control of our waters as an independent coastal state, and we will not link access to our waters to access to EU markets. Our fishing waters are our sovereign resource, and we will determine other countries’ access to our resources on our terms. We also hope to conclude an agreement on law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, so that we can work with the EU to protect their citizens and ours from shared threats, but we will not allow our own legal order to be compromised. By taking back full control of our borders, we can implement measures to make the British people even safer, and we can tackle terrorism and organised crime even more effectively. We also wish to conclude a number of technical agreements covering aviation and civil nuclear co-operation, which will help to ensure continuity for the UK on its new footing as an independent sovereign nation Securing agreement on all those questions should not, in principle, be difficult. We are, after all, only seeking relationships with the EU that it has with other nations—relationships that respect the interests and the sovereignty of both partners. It is in that light that we should view discussions about what has been termed the “level playing field”. It has been argued that EU demands in this area will make full agreement difficult, yet there is no intrinsic reason why requirements that both parties uphold desirable standards should prejudice any deal The United Kingdom has a proud record when it comes to environmental enhancement, workers’ rights and social protection. In a number of key areas, we either exceed EU standards or have led the way to improve standards. On workers’ rights, for example, the UK offers a year of maternity leave, with the option to convert it to parental leave, so that both parents can share care. The EU minimum is just 14 weeks. On environmental standards, we were the first country in the world to introduce legally binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets through the Climate Change Act 2008. We were also the first major global economy to set a legally binding target to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy by 2050 We will not dilute any existing protections. Indeed, as the Environment Bill debated yesterday demonstrates, we wish to go further and faster than the EU in improving the natural environment. We do not need the EU’s permission to be a liberal nation leading the world in the fight against climate change and for social progress. That is why the UK Government seek an FTA with robust protections for the environment and labour standards, but we do not see why the test of suitability in those areas should be adherence to EU law and submission to EU models of governance. The EU does not apply those principles to free trade agreements with other sovereign nations, and they should not apply to a sovereign United Kingdom Some argue that we must accept EU procedures as the benchmark because of the scale of UK trade with the EU, but the volume of UK trade with the EU is no greater than the volume of US trade with the EU, and the EU was more than willing to offer zero-tariff access to the US without the application of EU procedures to US standard setting. The EU has also argued that the UK is a unique case, owing to its geographical location, but proximity is not a determining factor in any other FTA between neighbouring states with large economies. It is not a reason for us to accept EU rules and regulations. We need only look at the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement for an example of a trade agreement that does not require regulatory alignment to one side’s rules or demand a role for one side’s court. Geography is no reason to undermine democracy To be clear, we will not be seeking to align dynamically with EU rules on EU terms governed by EU laws and EU institutions. The British people voted to take back control, to bring power home and to have the rules governing this country made by those who are directly accountable to the people of this country, and that is what we are delivering The negotiations are due to begin next week, led by the Prime Minister’s sherpa, David Frost, and I would like to end by looking ahead optimistically to the coming months. There is ample time during the transition period to strike the right deal for the UK. We hope to reach a broad agreement ahead of the EU Council’s high-level summit in June, whereupon we will take stock We know that our proposals are measured and our approach is fair. We know what we want to achieve. We are ready to go, and this Government are committed to establishing a future relationship in ways that benefit the whole UK and strengthen the Union. We are committed to working with the devolved Administrations to deliver a future relationship with the EU that works for the whole UK, and I take this opportunity to reassure colleagues that our negotiation that will be undertaken without prejudice and with full respect to the Northern Ireland protocol This Government will act in these negotiations on behalf of all of the territories for whose international relations the UK is responsible. In negotiating the future relationship between these territories and the EU, the UK Government will seek outcomes that support the territories’ security and economic interests, and reflect their unique characteristics. As the Prime Minister committed to do on Second Reading of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020, we will keep Parliament fully informed about the negotiations, and colleagues will be able to scrutinise our progress This Government are delivering on our manifesto commitments with energy and determination. This Government got Brexit done, and we will use our recovered sovereignty to be a force for good in the world and a fairer nation at home. We want and we will always seek the best possible relationship with our friends and allies in Europe, but we will always put the welfare of the British people first. That means ensuring the British people exercise the democratic control over our destiny for which they voted so decisively. That compact with the people is the most important deal of all, and in that spirit, I commend this statement to the House.', 'Thank you, Mr Speaker. I recognise the passion that the former Foreign Secretary demonstrated in promoting a global Britain to the world as we leave the European Union. I am also pleased to welcome my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton (Dominic Raab) as the new Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union On Friday at Chequers, the Cabinet agreed a comprehensive and ambitious proposal that provides a responsible and credible basis for progressing negotiations with the EU towards a new relationship after we leave on 29 March next year. It is a proposal that will take back control of our borders, our money and our laws, but do so in a way that protects jobs, allows us to strike new trade deals through an independent trade policy and keeps our people safe and our Union together Before I set out the details of this proposal, I want to start by explaining why we are putting it forward. The negotiations so far have settled virtually all of the withdrawal agreement, and we have agreed an implementation period that will provide businesses and Governments with the time to prepare for our future relationship with the EU. But on the nature of that future relationship, the two models that are on offer from the EU are simply not acceptable First, there is what is provided for in the European Council’s guidelines from March this year. This amounts to a standard free trade agreement for Great Britain, with Northern Ireland carved off in the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market, separated through a border in the Irish sea from the UK’s own internal market. No Prime Minister of our United Kingdom could ever accept this; it would be a profound betrayal of our precious Union. And while I know some might propose instead a free trade agreement for the UK as a whole, that is not on the table, because it would not allow us to meet our commitment under the Belfast agreement that there should be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland Secondly, there is what some people say is on offer from the EU: a model that is effectively membership of the European economic area, but going further in some places, and the whole of the UK remaining in the customs union. This would mean continued free movement, continued payment of vast sums every year to the EU for market access, a continued obligation to follow the vast bulk of EU law, and no independent trade policy, with no ability to strike our own trade deals around the world. I firmly believe this would not honour the referendum result, so if the EU continues on that course, there is a serious risk it could lead to no deal. This would most likely be a disorderly no deal, for without an agreement on our future relationship, I cannot see that this Parliament would approve the withdrawal agreement with a Northern Ireland protocol and financial commitments, and without those commitments, the EU would not sign a withdrawal agreement A responsible Government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up. But at the same time, we should recognise that such a disorderly no deal would have profound consequences for both the UK and the EU, and I believe that the UK deserves better The Cabinet agreed that we need to present the EU with a new model, evolving the position that I had set out in my Mansion House speech, so that we can accelerate negotiations over the summer, secure a new relationship in the autumn, pass the withdrawal and implementation Bill and leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 The friction-free movement of goods is the only way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and it is the only way to protect the uniquely integrated supply chains and just-in-time processes on which millions of jobs and livelihoods depend. So at the heart of our proposal is a UK-EU free trade area that will avoid the need for customs and regulatory checks at the border and protect those supply chains. Achieving this requires four steps. The first is a commitment to maintaining a common rulebook for industrial goods and agricultural products. To deliver this, the UK would make an up-front sovereign choice to commit to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods, covering only those necessary to provide for frictionless trade at the border. This would not cover services, because that is not necessary to ensure free flow at the border, and it would not include the common agricultural and fisheries policies, which the UK will leave when we leave the EU The regulations covered are relatively stable and supported by a large share of our manufacturing businesses. We would continue to play a strong role in shaping the European and international standards that underpin them, and there would be a parliamentary lock on all new rules and regulations, because when we leave the EU we will end the direct effect of EU law in the UK. All laws in the UK will be passed in Westminster, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Our Parliament would have the sovereign ability to reject any proposals if it so chose, recognising that there would be consequences, including for market access, if we chose a different approach from the EU Secondly, we will ensure a fair trading environment. Under our proposal, the UK and the EU would incorporate strong reciprocal commitments relating to state aid. We would establish co-operative arrangements between regulators on competition and commit to maintaining high regulatory standards for the environment, climate change, social and employment, and consumer protection Thirdly, we would need a joint institutional framework to provide for the consistent interpretation and application of UK-EU agreements by both parties. This would be done in the UK by UK courts and in the EU by EU courts, with due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook. This framework would also provide a robust and appropriate means for the resolution of disputes, including through the establishment of a joint committee of representatives from the UK and the EU. It would respect the autonomy of the UK’s and the EU’s legal orders and be based on the fundamental principle that the court of one party cannot resolve disputes between the two Fourthly, the Cabinet also agreed to put forward a new business-friendly customs model—a facilitated customs arrangement—that would remove the need for customs checks and controls between the UK and the EU because we would operate as if a combined customs territory. Crucially, it would also allow the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. The UK would apply the UK’s tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for the UK and the EU’s tariffs and trade policy for goods intended for the EU. Some 96% of businesses would be able to pay the correct tariff or no tariff at the UK border, so there would be no additional burdens for them compared with the status quo and they would be able to benefit from the new trade deals that we will strike. In addition, we will bring forward new technology to make our customs systems as smooth as possible for businesses that trade with the rest of the world Some have suggested that under this arrangement the UK would not be able to do trade deals. They are wrong. When we have left the EU, the UK will have its own independent trade policy, with its own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs for its trade with the rest of the world. We will be able to pursue trade agreements with key partners, and on Friday the Cabinet agreed that we would consider seeking accession to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership Our Brexit plan for Britain respects what we have heard from businesses about how they want to trade with the EU after we leave and will ensure we are best placed to capitalise on the industries of the future in line with our modern industrial strategy. Finally, as I have set out in this House before, our proposal includes a far-reaching security partnership that will ensure continued close co-operation with our allies across Europe while enabling us to operate an independent foreign and defence policy. So this is a plan that is not just good for British jobs but good for the safety and security of our people at home and in Europe too Some have asked whether this proposal is consistent with the commitments made in the Conservative manifesto. It is. The manifesto said: “As we leave the European Union, we will no longer be members of the single market or customs union but we will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free trade and customs agreement. ” What we are proposing is challenging for the European Union. It requires the EU to think again, to look beyond the positions that it has taken so far, and to agree a new and fair balance of rights and obligations. That is the only way in which to meet our commitments to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland without damaging the constitutional integrity of the UK and while respecting the result of the referendum. It is a balance that reflects the links that we have established over the last 40 years as some of the world’s largest economies and security partners. It is a bold proposal, which we will set out more fully in a White Paper on Thursday. We now expect the EU to engage seriously with the detail, and to intensify negotiations over the summer so that we can get the future relationship that I firmly believe is in all our interests In the two years since the referendum we have had a spirited national debate, with robust views echoing around the Cabinet table, as they have around breakfast tables up and down the country. Over that time I have listened to every possible idea and every possible version of Brexit. This is the right Brexit. It means leaving the European Union on 29 March 2019; a complete end to free movement, and taking back control of our borders; an end to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the UK, restoring the supremacy of British courts; no more sending vast sums of money each year to the EU, but instead a Brexit dividend to spend on domestic priorities such as our long-term plan for the NHS; flexibility on services, in which the UK is world-leading; no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and Great Britain; a parliamentary lock on all new rules and regulations; leaving the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy; the freedom to strike new trade deals around the world; an independent foreign and defence policy—but not the most distant relationship possible with our neighbours and friends; instead, a new deep and special partnership. It means frictionless trade in goods; shared commitments to high standards, so that together we continue to promote open and fair trade; and continued security co-operation to keep our people safe This is the Brexit that is in our national interest. It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people, and it is the right Brexit deal for Britain. I commend this statement to the House.', 'My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made today in another place by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister for the Cabinet Office. The Statement is as follows: “With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like now to make a Statement on the Government’s approach to our future relationship with the European Union Now that Britain has left the EU, we are entering a new chapter in the history of these islands.

A special greeting also to young people who accompany us and a very special greeting to all who love our homeland of Slovenia. It was a nice day yesterday. But I don\'t know if you were all aware of the absurdity of the moment. The only really state-owned move for the whole of Slovenia that has already failed the government of Marjan Šarc was to admit its incompetence and step down. One of the proofs is what is before us today, both marriages for which it is difficult to find a good word. What was the red thread of the government of Marjana Sharca all along its existence? The fact that the government of Marjana Sharca has demonstrated its development and security impotence every minute of every day with every measure. You know, it was about time she left. I\'m afraid a year and a half too late. Ronald Reagan once said that a country unable to defend its borders, effectively defend its borders, protect its citizens and citizens, does not really exist. There is not even an international community capable of doing so. Under these criteria, we all know that Slovenia and, if you like, the whole European Union are in great trouble. Mass migration is taking place daily. All those who believed after that first wave that this would be settled, now you could see how right I was when I argued that it hadn\'t even started for Slovenia. Today, numbers are unforgivable — more than 16,000 illegal migrants entered Slovenia illegally last year. So many were intercepted, it was estimated that there were three to ten times as many people across the Slovenian border without being recorded or returned to where they came from. It is even worse that Slovenia has become a target country for illegal migration, as evidenced by information that we almost would not believe. But this information, ladies and gentlemen, has been published by the OECD and some other international institutions. This is information that according to the number of applications for asylum of illegal migrants, Slovenia overcame Germany and France in last year. This means that someone is rolling all the problems, especially security, economic, social, all the other weight of illegal migration to Slovenia. Instead of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia doing everything at this time of its existence to effectively protect the Slovenian borders, and I always say that the Slovenian army and the police could effectively protect the Slovenian borders if the ruling coalition gave them the right powers. But the government and her coalition are making a fool of each other. They send the Slovenian army to the Slovenian border without giving it any authority. Boys who are educated and highly trained there can observe and possibly alert them to what they\'ve seen. However, they must not react in any way – they must not stop anyone, they must not protect Slovenia, the Slovenian borders, they must not do what they are only trained to do and what they want to do. That\'s why they went into the army because they\'re patriots. But politics doesn\'t let them. In fact, the government of Marjan Šarc has been funding the LGTB ideology of well-founded NGOs at all times, abundantly, in hundreds of millions of euros – that is, those who promote illegal migration. In this way, the government of Marjan Šarca has in fact promoted illegal migration, rather than restricting, through the financing of the LGTB ideology of well-founded non-governmental organisations. In this way, Slovenia and Slovenia, irresponsibly, emphatically additionally exposed Slovenia and Slovenia to the dangers posed by these illegal migrations. At that time, the government has taken the initiative to raise the so-called global agreement on safe, orderly and legal migration behind the back of citizens and citizens, contrary to the crystal clear law on external matters. The only one in this environment. The only one. Here in this House, however, she pretended that if she did not do so, Slovenia would become a lonely island because everyone wanted to. Now really Slovenia is a lonely island and in the eyes of illegal migrants, who are top-paid, there are no refugees, it drives money to the capitalists or financial speculators of Soros, but of course Arab money. In their eyes, Slovenia is a promised land. They\'re all equipped with new iPhones. It\'s always interesting to lose their personal documents, lose their families, but never lose their new iPhone. Isn\'t that interesting? Who\'s coming? Fugitives? Whoever says that is a liar, I make it public that he\'s a liar. In the last period, only and exclusively illegal migrants, and this is well organised, are organised by some secret services, which are linked to the media, the network, the iPhones and everything you invent, and which have here a fifth column in the form of those non-governments that this government pays and thus even boasts on its websites. They equip them with information, plans, equipment waiting here. When they are once in Slovenia, they help them to stall procedures, which Slovenia and Slovenians are extremely expensive to pay. This is the real situation facing Slovenia. At the same meeting, at which the Government proposes to prosecute those – about guards a little later – who could sometimes try to defend Slovenia or wish to exercise the right to self-defence, which is a fundamental human right, if anyone does not know it, will reject proposals aimed at tightening asylum legislation and some other things that all neighbouring countries have done, only Slovenia does not. Then we wonder if any illegal migrant who is asked where he wants to go in Bosnia says: “Ou, Slovenia, Slovenia!” Yes, of course, because paid activists go down, they are directed, they explain everything to them, and the Slovenians and Slovenians as taxpayers because of the government, the failed government as it was, and because of its coalition we pay for it all. As far as the guard is concerned, the situation is very interesting. If you want to hide your own incompetence, the tactic of the Slovenian failed government of Marjan Šarc, by the way, is to divert attention to 70 years of age. And then you make up your guard. What exactly are guards? Since I am sure that someone else will find himself today who will say something clever about the topic of right extremism, I would first quote you Viljko Bruce, the call for NOB values fighters to support Andrej Šiška as president: ""I call you because Andrej Šiško and his values are more consistent with NOB and more dedicated to NOB than all the others who are offered to us. And in order to realize all of this, I invite you all to vote for Andre Šiška."" This was in the last election campaign when Andrei Shisko was the candidate for president of the state. So much for someone talking about some right-wing extremists or something. Wilko Bruce said this very nicely, he said: “With this red star that I have on my forehead, I invite you to vote for Andrei Šiška, because he is more devoted to these values”, so the red star, “like everyone else.” So much so that it\'ll be clear where the guards belong if there\'s no one else. Who\'s the extremist, anyway? There are also many problems in Slovenia. It is the extreme one who is ready to achieve his political goals to cut off violence. This is a definition that applies all over the world. Who is this in Slovenia? It was very nice to see you once. This was on Kotnikov in Ljubljana. On the one hand, the left-wing antifaiths stood with anything in their hands, placed in the crowd control cordon, as it is called, say, they were also trained, they knew what they were doing, they were ready to use force against their own nation for the benefit of foreigners, and on the other hand they were Slovenians and Slovenes, and I do not know what kind of horsemen and all turned against these Slovenes and Slovenians who carried Slovenian flags, sang songs and read the Zdravica. Who is the extremist here, ladies and gentlemen? There are no right-wing extremists in Slovenia, and as many left-wing extremists as you want. Some also sit in this House, by this definition. For after those in the first place with any in hand, they were those who were their immediate supporters, some from the Left, and Tanya Fajon from behind, and Milan Kučan from behind, and the president of the school union, and so on and so forth. Let the man get his hair up! Tell me who you\'re hanging out with, and I\'ll tell you who you are. Besides, is this new in Slovenia? When Wilko Bruce called for support for Mr Šiška, because he is more consistent with the values of the revolution – the values of the revolution lie in six hundred pits after Slovenia, unburied. Even today, children who have been brutally killed by partisans in the Iga must not be buried at the Zalah cemetery in Ljubljana, as babies deserve, people of God. But they\'re fighting publicly, and Jankovic won\'t let it happen, and Kučan won\'t let it happen. In any case, it\'s a disgrace to everyone. But it says a lot about who is who in Slovenia. Just as much as this legislation says. Instead of persecuting those who illegally invade us, this is an invasion of the territory of the democratic state of Slovenia, they are pursuing those who are trying to organize themselves in order to protect themselves. Although self-defense, self-defence, I say again, is a fundamental human right based on the fundamental international instruments governing this area. If you don\'t believe them, go, brother. By the way, read more about constitutional law. So why did the government use these guards and blow them up like I don\'t know how important they are? Yeah, because it\'s obviously something that\'s close to them. With the red star on the forehead, with the values of NOB is something that is manageable. They may also have hoped that someone would fall out of Parliament at the next election, but they wanted to raise this artificially in order to gain something similar or something even more manageable than this moment. This, in my opinion, was the goal. Otherwise, a person simply cannot explain it to himself. It is even more interesting that there has been a lot of information about the fact that there are some who have been convicted criminals, and also some who have been paid by members of the criminal police. So in the end, you don\'t know if the government is organizing or persecuting it if any of this is true. But I can\'t judge that, and I can\'t even examine it because I\'m not President of KNOVS anymore. Otherwise, believe me, I would have dealt with this a long time ago when it first appeared that attention had been diverted from the undemocratic issuance of voters on the basis of which even such a government as it was formed. That was the first time these guards actually showed up. Second, when it turned out that the Slovenian borders were completely unprotected, they shouted over everything that lays and goes – over 16,000 intercepted, the people of God. This is according to the official estimates you have available. But there are several times as many who have not been recorded and crossed the Slovenian border. How many of these have been processed, punished? Probably nothing. I know that some tasks have been given, but none of these men have been punished in the end, and thousands of empty tasks remain, so they are obviously their own purpose. What is worse, not only is not allowed by the government and the ruling coalition of Slovenian military and Slovenian police to effectively secure the Slovenian border, which is known if there are even worse things to do, how to avenge them, but it is not obvious that the entire system of justice will protect Slovenian citizens and citizens. And we should talk about it, ladies and gentlemen. Do you even know what is happening under this government in the system of Slovenian justice? Not because of the various guards, but because of the illegal migrants who were directly caught in the crime, they were not even detained. On the contrary. They put them in a nice asylum home, fill up their iPhones a little bit more so that they can go on a quiet journey abroad and then stop the prosecution by reasoning that the prosecution would be disproportionate to the crime committed. But the crime committed is that two of them stole Audi\'s personal car, caused a serious traffic accident, smashed it, so it\'s said, at least two obvious crimes – the theft of the vehicle and the destruction of other things, and not in some material value, but it\'s an Audi brand What\'s the signal here? [[…]] Here is a crystal clear signal from the government that is responsible for this area as all other areas of life, the Justice Department and the ruling coalitions: illegal migrants can do whatever they want, take your car, break it down, steal you, rob you, nothing will happen to them. No one will protect you. Slovenians and Slovenes will not be protected. We only protect foreigners. That\'s a signal anyone can get out of this. And believe that illegal migrants were able to read it very well, and Slovenians and Slovenians understand it very clearly. Such a government is not worth anything. Such a government is acting contrary to constitutional principles. Where is the principle of equality before the law to let go of everything else at this point? Where is the principle of equality before marriage? Whatever you, whoever\'s in the coalition, take your neighbor\'s car and kill yourself and we\'ll see how it ends. Will the charges against you be dropped because they will say that this is a negligible crime, so that it would be disproportionate then to persecute the one who did it? First, of course, you let him go to a home, that he can go abroad, that he can escape, that he can be more difficult to reach, and then you\'re not even chasing him anymore. Although, by the way, in Europe, as we all know, there is a very good system of persecution and international tyranny and so on, and this is not a question at all. If that\'s what you want. Desires, ladies and gentlemen, is the problem! Here, not only does he want to do things for illegal migrants, in fact, criminals, but he obviously wants to hide it from the public. That\'s why there was talk of hate speech. You have already heard that word in this hall today. What about hate speech, ladies and gentlemen of law? It\'s not defined, it doesn\'t even exist. The hate speech is a flossule with which leftists have been fighting the truth for many years, and then they hide it for a variety of expressions. The hate speech is really all that truth that bothers left-wing people. That\'s the definition of hate speech by removing all those big words. Then it happens that an illegal migrant comes out of prison and, instead of sending him from where he came from, was previously rejected after reporting to the media his request for asylum, it is said that he should have been abroad long ago, but not. Leave it in Slovenia. It is strange that it has not yet been brought to the Slovenian Parliament to be slightly accepted by the President of Parliament and by some who like to do so. And he used this to rape two Slovenian girls, at least one of them was underage. In one case, there was also severe knife violence. Who\'s responsible for this? I claim that those on the government, ladies and gentlemen, and those as officials who have abandoned their duties. It\'s not just political, it\'s criminal liability. But what\'s even more frightening about this story? He\'s hiding this information. When the matter finally begins to unfold, however, it turns out that this migrant was legally convicted and had been in prison for two years. When I ask the Government who will be responsible for not being sent immediately after the suspension of the sentence, from where it came from, because it should have been long ago after all the available information, the Government replied that it had not been sentenced to a foreign penalty of expulsion. Wait, like that\'s the only reason or the only way you can get someone out of the country. Are you kidding me? From who? From the people, from their safety? With these laws that are before us today, you are certainly making a fool of ordinary citizens and citizens. Instead of persecuting criminals, you protect them and turn against your own citizens and citizens. What else has turned out to be the case with this illegal migrant? In the end, even this crime turned out to be an extremely violent robbery by two women, one being thrown on the ground and has lasting consequences — that he had been convicted before, but on probation for other crimes. But none of these judgments can be fully obtained in order to be presented to the public. Even journalist Peter Jančič couldn\'t get them despite the demands. Mrs. Prelesnikov, who was once the secretary-general in this Parliament, today is supposed to protect information as an information officer, replied: “Yes, because the information system of justice does not allow these judgments to be found.” If that\'s true, then the secretary should be replaced immediately. Well, she did fall with the whole government, which failed completely. But of course that\'s not true. It\'s a joke from people. This is said to be the case, all institutions, the judiciary, the information officer, everyone makes a fool of Slovenian citizens and citizens on schedule, systematically for the benefit of foreigners. This is the real situation we face today in Slovenia. And then the government suggests that action should be taken against those who wear children\'s toys and impersonate a uniform. Look, I\'ve only seen dozens of events in recent years, one last time in Dražgoša, where people in real uniforms paraded with real weapons, which, by the way, is prohibited under current legislation. Those who do not know this are also prohibited from carrying disabled weapons under the current legislation, to public events where more people are being gathered and so on. Did the police take action? No, no, no. Was the minister responsible for this? No, no, no. Was he warned? Oh, yes, he was, but many times. Did that upset people? Believe that the gathering of men who killed animals after the war and even killed young girls alive there in the pit of the Devil, and they carry weapons, certainly disturbs all those relatives who are still alive from that period, and also others. So when you propose such a law, let’s first stop making a fool of yourself, and think a little about what you’re doing. Even when Veljko Bruce praised Mr Šiška, there were many of them with uniforms and weapons around there. Of course, that doesn\'t lead anywhere. Here you will have to finally have the same criteria for all and return to the starting point required by the Slovenian Constitution. This is said to apply without exception to all and to all in the same way. If someone does something illegal and it is found to be done, it must be processed, for which a person must be held accountable and punished. If someone broke into the border illegally, they\'ll send him where he came from. Then an appropriate procedure shall be carried out. This procedure is unacceptable to delay at the expense of Slovenian taxpayers and it is necessary to stop financing all those who, in LGTB\'s ideologies justified, non-governmental organisations that do not work other than to speed up the incursions on the Republic of Slovenia and then to say very clearly and very much that they are illegal migrants, all of whom are mass-abuses of the right to asylum, which is what the former interior minister Mrs Györköseva has to say that they are no longer being financed. And it\'s all over, and it\'s right now. People should be allowed to defend themselves if the state is unable to do so. Why were these guards actually used by the government? Because I think it\'s all a media and government structure together. Because of the fact that there really is no serious self-organization of people who are at risk. If every day you have dozens of or hundreds of illegal migrants under a cannon window, of course, alone to fight capable men, those who show pictures of women and children today, it is better not to comment on this in Slovenian circumstances, these are soldiers who are coming. That\'s what Erdoggan said, the mosques are our fortresses, the domes of our helmets, the believers are our army. And their service, believe it or not, is still quite a part of this story. And he\'s letting go pretty now, he\'s forcing Europe with these people, and he\'s cashing money, but this curtain is no longer working well, you all know, because it has a different computer, and he has internal policy problems showing that he is the master of Europe for his inner audience. Someone who gets blackmailed once will always be blackmailed, ladies and gentlemen. First and foremost, the state should be aware that the right, the fundamental right of every Slovenian, every Slovenian, every Slovenian child to live safely. Everyone has the right to personal integrity, and this is due as a first and unconditional measure to carry out any government to the greatest extent possible, but not to finance NGOs, to send soldiers to the border without authorization, to ensure that those who expose their health and life are not adequately paid to continue to protect Slovenia and all of us in such situations. And believe me, I really do say thank you very much. Only I would like to allow them to actually do it effectively, because these people are capable of it, they want it, and many others could have it if they had pursued the right policy. But such laws, such as those before us today, certainly do not lead in this direction, but completely elsewhere, because this is not in the interest of this government. What do leftists really want? Leftists on purpose pay NGOs, on LGBT\'s ideology justified NGOs to go down, recruit, accelerate the beating of illegal migrants into Slovenia and then delay them to stay here as long as possible and to cost as much as possible. Why? Because in the long run, they, the leftists, see in these people their future voters, and in the short run, money. For all the story of the so-called refugees is certainly seductive. There are no refugees. That\'s all I\'ve been saying all these years without exception, I\'ve never agreed to have any fugitives here. What kind of fugitives? We had refugees, yes, when they were from the former Yugoslavia, women, mothers with children, older. There were 72 thousand of them, we received them nicely, and then the vast majority went very quickly to where they came from, because they were really refugees. What is coming today, however, is capable of fighting and trained by healthy men, a vast majority between the ages of 18 and 40, virtually all from countries where there is no war. But from which countries are the most illegal migrants who break into Slovenia? Do I list them? You all know each other well. Pakistan, then everything from Morocco to, if you want, Egypt, but I don\'t know which countries at this point, because things are changing a little bit, Algeria, let\'s say. Where are the great wars that would have driven these crowds? As with the Syrians, we all know, in ship\'s containers, they were carrying copies, or at that time they were original because the country had fallen apart, their documents and then sold them through Turkey, and it is known that they were all Syrians. And that\'s why everyone\'s birthday is on the 1st. 1. and similar, and that is why these documents get lost very quickly when some serious control is needed. The document itself is original, but then it\'s written a little bit like that at home. Of course, these people do not have anything to do with their escape; even more nonsense is that they run from climate change. Yeah, sure, sure. It\'s a bargaining money. Do you know that they found a lot of people who also had €300,000 in cash? You go with 300,000 Euros of cash here across the border and you\'ll see what happens to you. And you\'re EU citizens. However, in certain parts of this story, almost everyone had a few small sums. There are also those who don\'t have that much in common, but don\'t say they\'re some poor people, and I don\'t know what they are. Ask yourself, too, what kind of people are coming if they leave their families – like crying out the Ljubljana barber Ahmad Shami for their own declaration – where there is a war where fighting is raging, where they should live, and leave their children and their wife there instead of bringing them with them or protecting them with all the means available to them. Ask yourself what these people are like, what does Europe import, what do you import? Let\'s ask ourselves that, after the human wage. Maybe you\'ll have a little bit of a meltdown. The problem of what Europe is really doing is quite different. It\'s a problem of radical Islamisation of Europe. Islam is being radicalized around the world, and I regret to say that it is Erdoggan, with whom Europe is so fond of talking, who has probably helped the most because it has completely destroyed the secular heritage of Turkey. Because for Atatürk, radical Islam was a decomposing body. You have his expression on the Internet. You must be aware that sharia with a modern concept of law is completely incompatible with human rights. These people who are coming, they\'re from radical Islam and they feel committed to Sharia. What\'s more, they\'re setting up Sharia here, on our soil, the goal. Which is personally frightening to me, but I have witnessed it myself, there are discussions with us where constitutional lawyers, supreme judges, university professors are involved, and this is the most prominent where they are deadly discussing how to effectively involve Sharia law in the trials of our courts. Excuse me? The inclusion of Sharia law, ladies and gentlemen, in the work of the courts means the total negation of the rule of law and modern law after all we know. But I also tell him myself in the face that he\'s lying. It\'s absolutely impossible for these two to have a united relationship. As long as the law is the same for all, and as long as the regulation has to be made public before it enters into force, and as long as the legal order and the constitutional order of the State are in force, Sharia law cannot have any room here, certainly not in the Slovenian courts. Then, if this is discussed, I am not surprised that they are giving Slovenian justice under the leadership of Minister Katičeva of the SD signal to illegal migrants: steal, pillage – as their predecessors once did after World War II – take ownership of Slovenian citizens and citizens, destroy it, nothing will happen to you, we will allow you to leave peacefully and then we will stop the matter from being a problem. That\'s unacceptable! It\'s a crime on its own. This is the suspension of the duty of acting and the negligence of the responsible person. In the Penal Code, you have articles that clearly define this, only now is who\'s going to follow someone here. Katič\'s own self certainly not, but the others responsible for the government, not in his coalition, but all those who are subordinate to them, because then it\'s like a dog chasing its tail that never gets caught. But that\'s unacceptable. All I hope is that people are watching this and that they understand. Then what\'s going on? There is a gradual radical Islamisation of Europe, including in Slovenia. Since I was President of Knovs, I have warned that the cells of radical Islam have developed in Slovenia, from Jessenic, Ljubljana, Celje, Maribor to New City, I can also list if you like. When this combines with those who are trained to fight with war experiences, it creates the most dangerous combination, which in the past led, for example, to Bataclan, to a monstrous slaughter, where, as it hides in Slovenia from the public, what illegal migrants bring, it hides that people there not only killed themselves, but also horribly tortured that women cut themselves there, and that I don\'t say anything else because I don\'t know if they would believe me. But you have all this in official reports, but they\'re hiding from the public. What is the problem of radical Islamization? For radical Islam, the world is divided into two spaces: it is a world of peace, which is only a world of radical Islam, and with everything else they are at war; everything else is a world of war. They are with Europe, with all of you, even with you who support them, in war. Even if they\'re covering it up today. They even have a special term for it. This is how they behave, and they will, believe it or not. But here we talk about the religion of peace, and for force it is suppressed by all those who warn of this danger. There are currents within Islam itself, such as in Indonesia, that warn how important this is to change it. And why doesn\'t it change? The problem is that radical Islamists are a billion and a half. Not to mix this with some of our Bosniaks, who are a few million. And then people naively imagine, if I know the Bosniaks – and they\'re great, I also have some colleagues there – then everyone is fine. Yeah, sure, you guys go down a little once! I lived there, too, and I saw something. When you see someone beating a woman with a metre of pollen in a burka, you hear them breaking bones, and you want to help, but you can\'t because they\'re two with guns in their hands and they point him at you, and then you ask yourself where you live. This is totally incomprehensible for Europe. But would you believe that this happened in Turkey? I know. I was in Turkey a few years ago. On a side street in Istanbul, which is the most European part of Turkey. To imagine how things have changed and how the world is changing. That\'s what we should be talking about today. That\'s a security challenge. This is the worst security challenge Europe has ever faced since the end of World War II. This challenge is here and now. For if radical Islam prevails, Europe will no longer be Europe. Europe today is Europe, with European civilisation, with a consistent protection of human rights, with everything it is, just because it has remained a Christian Europe and fought Islam with the military when it broke through. Also in Sisak, Slovenia and Slovenians, Kranjci, said that they had defeated the Turkish army and defended Europe. It would be time for us to learn something from history. This path, the well-respected minister you picked up here, is completely wrong. First you must do your job, first you must be able to protect the state of Slovenia, protect the border, protect every resident, close the border for illegal migration to the greatest extent possible, only then you can go see what everyone else is doing. But to divert attention from what is a real and real danger to some parade of people who are just raising attention, you\'re helping them because it\'s more nice not to see what\'s going on back there. Now you have two mechanisms, one is that, the sun will burn us up, and everyone up there can\'t see the migrants walking in front of their noses, but you\'ll say, look, those guards there are paraded to watch everyone there, so they won\'t see the migrants walking across the border. It\'s not going anywhere. First, the government must take care of all that the Constitution and the laws dictate. All these years, I have advocated only one thing — that we should respect the rule of law in a consistent manner. If we respected the rule of law in the European Union as a whole, headed by a Dublin agreement, for all equally, for all without exception, if we respected the legal order of the Republic of Slovenia, none of what happened could have happened at all. But things were going in the wrong direction under your government, and now we are practically surrounded by countries that are trying to protect ourselves. Austria will no longer accept refugees, nor within the framework of the European programmes anymore, this has been said publicly, nor has the new government, if anyone thought otherwise, made a serious mistake. Thus, the only hope remains to start organizing ourselves, to rely on our forces in Slovenia, of course in a legitimate way, and to find friends abroad where we actually have them, especially in the Visegrad Group, which you are ashamed of, and sometimes some of you are voting against and so on. It\'s the only place where we have real friends in these situations in Europe. Europe is no longer able to unify itself on this issue. Why? Since some countries already have so many migrants that they simply can no longer take certain measures, France, Germany to a large extent, Britain. How they solve this problem, I don\'t even want to think because they won\'t. How this is going to end, one way or another, you can\'t do it in a good way, and you think what you want. Slovenia is still in an area where it can easily protect its borders, where it can easily take care of the security of citizens and citizens, but it has to support itself, not wait for what Europe will do, but I do not know what European – nothing will do about it. Europe, if this goes on, believe me, it won\'t be a very long time, which is a shame, because Slovenia needs Europe because it is an export country. But these things are so powerful, they tear apart. Prior to any such adoption, security must be taken care of. This is a responsibility, Mr Minister, first of all you and the governments, even if it is scientific, and it has been all this time, but it will remain this task to come. And it will have to be carried out in one way or another, not waiting for someone else to do it instead of Slovenia. But what\'s more, you\'re dealing with trying to divert your opinion to cover up the proceedings. Because it\'s actually a government policy. If you didn\'t, you would have acted. If a court that has an article in its constitution that is required to ensure the public administration of the judgment and the public declaration of the judgment does not, in a case which has not been closed to the public, say either, what was the verdict or it does not want – I mean, this exception, when something can be closed to the public in the court, lays down the law and these exceptions are very tightly written. [[…]] This is when you have, say, younger minors and similar to the victims, but not if these two illegal migrants are taking a car or committing a serious crime of robbery, including bodily harm, two women attacking or migrant, and then hiding it. And then he hides behind that he\'s been convicted before. So this is planned, and the government is responsible for it. The government should act if this is not its policy. If not, however, it is an objective fact that this has become its policy. This is similar to the infamous disgrace afforded by the Secretary of State, who was at the Ministry of Education, for Christmas. The government did not act. This objectively led to the responsibility of the entire government and its coalition, despite the fact that the government has now fallen apart. Now you\'re all responsible for not taking action. The same is true here, in cases of illegal migration – if no action is taken, you are liable if it is permitted that the court intentionally hides things from the public, if things are hidden, you are responsible. If this is a policy in those media that are paid out of public money, you are also responsible in the part where it is the responsibility of the government. The law here is crystal clear. Each area of social life is the responsibility of the Government in that part that falls under its jurisdiction, and that minister whose individual actions fall within the purview of it. For this reason, Mr Minister, the SDS will not, of course, support such a law. For as long as the Government pays on LGBT\'s ideology justified NGOs to speed up the intrusion of illegal migrants into Slovenia and to delay procedures then in Slovenia, what the Slovenians are paying dearly, thereby also reducing the safety of all Slovenes and Slovenes until you take care of the appropriate powers, for an appropriate salary, for all the conditions of those protecting the state of Slovenia at the Slovenian border and within its borders, such a proposal is shameful. It is quite shameful and only a diversion of attention, but at the same time it is contrary to what, for the third time, I repeat, is a principle that is also known by international law and constitutional law. The right to self-defence, ladies and gentlemen, is a human right, even if it is sometimes written in Slovenian legislation. This is above this legislation, because this is about things that touch on fundamental legal acts that regulate international relations throughout the world during the post-World War II period, and they can also be used under the Slovenian Constitution directly when it comes to such a type of act that it is possible. For this reason, I suggest that you define yourself by cancelling this law and simply ending with the fact that this is a disgrace to the government, is a disgrace to the state, is a disgrace to you personally. It\'s not going anywhere. Today we should discuss the tightening of asylum legislation, the tightening of those legal acts governing family reunification. All the neighbouring countries have done this, Slovenia is still waiting. We should talk about the responsibility of those who hide information about the crime of illegal migrants against the public, who hide judgments that run counter to the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia – we should talk about this today. Not about what\'s in front of us today. For this reason, of course, we will not support these laws in the SDS.', ""Thank you very much again. First of all, I should like to thank you for everything that has been said by the various representatives of the parliamentary groups. I can do what I said on the board today. If we look at a general, large picture, virtually all the parliamentary groups, with the exception of the Levica Group, agree on the direction in which Slovenia should sail in the next nine or ten years. Where we differ, however, there is an approach, an ambition on what we can do during this period and what our priorities are during this decade. Whether these funds we have in the framework of the recovery plan in combination with all other funds is sufficient to make this developmental shift or not. And if they are enough — and I understand in this regard that we agree — it is essential whether we are prepared to make this development move to support the reforms needed to do so. And here is the key where, as I can see, in view of what is happening in the last days of the National Assembly, the representatives of the parties who convened this meeting and the representatives of the coalition and some other parties are different. And here I think that this is a very important point if we fail to resolve it properly in some dialogue, whether we will succeed in these efforts in the coming years. With regard to this so-called alternative plan, which it is not, I understand that it is difficult to get through almost a thousand pages of material, but the essentials are summarised on several sides and it would be enough to look at these few pages. If you believe that these 20 pages of the so-called alternative plan – the material together with the explanations of 30 pages – are what Slovenia needs in the next ten years, I repeat, suggest a procedural decision to vote on this and to send it to Brussels. I don't have any problems with that. People, the state, I've already said that on the board. I propose that in this further debate, we focus on those essential substantive points that await us in the next ten years. Once again, I would like to stress that all good and concrete proposals, both those that have been made so far, as those that will be mediated in this process, will be taken into account, regardless of who they come from, until the conclusion of the final plan, which will go to the benefit of the people and which will pursue the objectives that Slovenia and the European Union are pursuing. Those proposals that cannot be placed in this plan, given that it is limited financially, are already being put in place and will be placed in future in other funding mechanisms. One part of this has been placed in REACT, one part of which we have been able to put into existing financial perspectives and an essential part of what cannot be placed in the recovery plan is placed in the financial perspective 2021-2027, where, as I have said, only from the European grants will there be twice as many grants as within the RRF, amount to 3 billion 200. If we add a national contribution to this, we are talking about about about €4 billion 200 million over the next nine years. This aspect, in my view, should be viewed as a whole and we are not focusing on this part, which, in the whole structure, the truth of the love, if we deduct the loans, is essentially a minority share of future grants. Some of the things that have been said must be demarcated, otherwise they have already been demented a hundred times, but it is obvious that it is necessary to keep on and on the communication and how the dialogue has been conducted, and that there were not a thousand 300 participants in the Hill, but that this meeting has been held virtually due to the situation, in the light of the formal conditions of communication with the holders of the visa, the European Commission has been sufficiently discussed on the Monitoring Committee held last October. Enough, absolutely enough, nothing else would have to be done, but we wanted this matter to be communicated as much as possible, mainly because it was of great interest from different local backgrounds, especially in whether these resources from the recovery plan would also be allocated to individual local projects. Of course, part of the funds will also be allocated to these projects on the basis of calls for proposals in specific areas, in particular in the area of restoration of sewage systems, cleaning plants, public buildings also in the area of local communities, energy recovery and so on. Because that's normal, because we live in the same country. All the projects that are going in the direction, which is now somehow a leading note at the level of the European Union – green and smart; all that goes in the sense of green and smart is somehow a priority and must also be done. However, I said that we may differ in how we understand these individual directions. We understand them from a practical point of view in such a way that we actually take measures that will also achieve these green and other objectives. It has been said by the representative of the proposalers of Mr Trčko that it is time to bury the axes. Here. But who was digging them up?Oh, my God! Who now digs up an axe in one of the major reforms, which will also be a condition for drawing funds, is the demographic fund?Oh, my God! This is just one of the reforms that will be part of this plan. If this is not adopted in Parliament, there will be no such means. It will not, because one of the goals will not be achieved. So at the first point, let me bury this axe, let me bury it, not block a thing that's good that goes in the interests of people who go primarily in the interest of those who for decades have created this property. And I think it is fair that we now manage this property in such a way that the management of this property will be one of the pillars, one of the pillars, not one of the pillars, one of the pillars for long-term ensuring the stability of the pension treasury. And if we fail to agree at this point on how we will then, in all the other necessary reforms, for which we all find that they should have already been made, they have not been. For example, one of the essentials is, of course, education reform related to the labour market. For the last time, I told the Committee that it is impossible, given the changed situation, that this world is developing, that some professions are dying out, to make a change in this area, and to start educating people who will eventually get the job; but not to direct young people to jobs that no longer have a future. And we need to face it as soon as possible. If we do not face these changes, we will not achieve them. And now I really want to know if you're going to support this change when it comes to it or not, because it's urgent. When we talk about young people having to have a choice and deciding for themselves what to study. Yes, I absolutely agree with that. But now tell me an example, dozens of young people are rejected every year and, say, they can't study medicine because there aren't enough places to enroll in, like, dozens of young people. On the other hand, there's a shortage of this frame. There is something similar about secondary education in the same professions. There's something similar about computer science, computer science. Dozens of young people are unable to study because of limited enrollment. But we did not prevent them from choosing, and the work could eventually be easily obtained. And they do not burden the employment institution and do not burden all other funds in such cases, because those personnel profiles which are not appropriate and which are not absorbed by the labour market should be retrained. Retrain. And for this it is necessary to allocate funds, unfortunately also from European funds; and the data say that these funds are not so small. Not the tens of millions in the whole perspective, hundreds of millions in the entire perspective go to hundreds of millions of these resources, which we devote to making a misdirection at the starting point in the education system, then trying to rehabilitate by retraining these people. The basis of what we want to do in the next nine or ten years is these changes, which are urgent; and without them there will be no breakthrough. Ambassador Duck said that what was to be concrete should have been concrete 15 to 20 years ago, and we didn't. Look, I don't know. The SD has been substantially in power for many years as the Slovenian Democratic Party and, like all other parties to the current coalition, for many years. Why didn't you knock it off? Nor do I agree that there is a conflict between knowledge, innovation, high technologies, the system 5G, 4.0, 5.0 and so on, and so-called, in grave terms, concrete. There's no such thing as a conflict. I don't know if we really don't understand that. If we want to make a reform in a particular area, let's say an example of long-term care and a system of this protection of the elderly, then, given the current undernutrition of capacity, we urgently need new capacities, according to your concrete. It's not concrete for me. For me it's homes, it's a house, it's a home where these people live. It's not concrete, it's something else. From 2013 to 2018, Minister from SD was Minister for this area, Anja Kopač Mrak, from 2013 to 2018, for five years. No place for home care has been awarded in these five years through the concession, none. Not one new bed was built from public funds during this period, something was maintained, something was flickering and so on. Not one. And then at the same time, you say it's a problem to invest in concrete. And you're talking about that we have a problem, that we had a problem in this pandemic, mainly because these capacities weren't appropriate. Yes, we still have it today, today, because it can't be arranged in one year or overnight. In three years, yes. By the end of 2023, be assured that in this Slovenia there will be at least 2 000 new places in domestic care, at least 2 000 new cities, through concessions and via public network. If we had them yesterday, I firmly believe that 80% of the problems we had with the infections and everything that followed in the homes for the elderly would be gone. But because this was not the case, because we know what individual homes were built 40 years ago, more of a sailboat than homes, of course it was impossible to do that. And now it's time to do it. And that is why I do not understand the statement in this proposal, where you say that when we talk about the REACT initiative, where it is available by the end of 2023, 330 million euros in funding, about a third of which we are committed to strengthening this social security system, especially the home system at different levels, so that we are dealing with the problem in a partial way. We don't do anything partial. This cannot be part of this plan, thank God it is not, because the regulation setting out the use of this money was adopted at the end of December. And since we knew that it would not be operational for much longer – and it became operational today or yesterday, in the sense that we could even make a formal change in the validation procedure – the government is 23. 12. Decided that decisions to support projects under this initiative could be made earlier. And we betray them. Last week, I said that we issued the first decision to move a lung in Maribor, which will release the premises where a nursing hospital will be established within two years. Yesterday I signed support for 4 million and a half for the renovation of premises in UKC Ljubljana, where there will be an additional 87 cities from 33 cities for the needs of the nursing hospital, there are 120 cities. By the end of March, a decision will be taken to support a complete reconstruction of the UKC parent building of EUR 50 million. These are all investments coming from REACT. And the fact that we can do these things quickly now makes it possible for us to reach a decision of the Government of 23. 12. which speaks of the possibility of issuing conditional decisions prior to formal confirmation. And so for at least half a year, we have accelerated the preparation and implementation of investments, because in larger, say UKC, this complete reconstruction will take two and a half years, and it must be completed by 31. 12. 2023. A thousand 285 concessions, a thousand 285 cities, will be awarded for capacity in the nursing homes. From the public network, thousands of 500 to 2 000 cities will be provided through REACT and the Recovery and Resistance Plan plus 30 million state budget funds for 2020 and 2021. Over the next three to four years – 3 thousand 900 to 4 thousand 400 new cities in nursing homes. If this deficit, which has been on the rise for the last ten, twelve years and, above all, in the last seven, six years, had been reduced by at least half, the consequences of this pandemic would have been significantly lower in this population. But we can't talk about investing in concrete, please. You say that if we invest here, we invest in concrete, if we invest in UKC, we invest in concrete. If we're investing in hospital renovations all over the country, are we investing in concrete?Oh, my God! No, we are investing in the energy renovations of all these buildings because they are older, and we are also following these objectives, followed by the European Union. The same applies to all other investments carried out in other areas. This dilemma about roads and railways is also an artificial dilemma. By the way, don't hold what you're saying, four too many for the roads as for the railroads. But now we really need to look at the whole here, and if we look at all the resources from which the modernisation of rail infrastructure will be financed over the next nine years, we are talking about investments in rail infrastructure over 2 billion and a half euros. And also from the grants, the number for railways is higher than for road infrastructure, I think about 170 million, for road around 160, but that's not important. Do you think that Koros do not need a normal road connection, or do they not need the 3rd development axis, which we have been postponing for years and years in a different way? It's been delayed, now it's finally started. Do you believe that this existing link contributes less or more to environmental objectives? Is there going to be more exhausts and everything else in this connection, or is there going to be more exhausts and everything else? This link, while road, is normal, contributes both to environmental objectives and to all other objectives because it enables better connectivity, better mobility, enables development in the region, which is now hampered by inadequate links. It is true, however, that in terms of achieving the green and digital table annexed to the Regulation, such a road does not contribute anything, nothing percent; but this does not mean that it does not have to be done. It has to be done. As I told you in the introduction; for everyone who thinks normally, the contribution to green is if a sewage treatment plant is made somewhere, that systems that are now running dirty into individual waters are arranged; it is a 100 % contribution to green; and only 40 % of them are reported in these tables. However, we are trying to combine smaller systems with a recovery plan because Slovenia is specific to population and is rarely populated and it is impossible to operate large systems in individual areas, and the European Commission says that less than 2 000 can't use European money in the sewers. Why not? If we are pursuing goals that say that we need to preserve the environment; and something that is very important about Slovenia. Not only do we have one of the largest shares of Natura 2000 and other insurance areas, we also have an extremely large number of water resources and water protection areas. And you need to be protected. And if we want to protect them, we can only protect them by cleaning up everything that's dirty, by collecting it in one proper way and doing it through these systems then onward. And one of the problems is, of course, the lack of this percentage, which again means that these investments and these very necessary plans will have to be combined with other mechanisms; and we will do so. With this emphasis on the need to combine different financial resources in this planning period by 2030, we are very aware of this and we will also do it in the future, but let me say it again. Formal rules are just what they are. As has been said since this favourable financial framework was negotiated on 21 July both at the level of the European Union and Slovenia, it was clear that we have around EUR 12 billion available by 2030, which means, if we generalise, about a billion a year in the next period. So far, we've been pumping between 400 million and 500 million a year. It was very rare for years that Slovenia managed to absorb 700 to 800 million. We have a difficult task ahead of us, and we are very aware of that, which is why we are also changing the organisational structure and everything else, so that we can do these things wisely and, above all, in a qualitative way. When we talk about these 12 billion, this is how it was supposed to be, we had about a billion more from the existing perspective 800, now it's about 400 million less, so from the existing perspective we have available up to the end of 2023 another billion EUR 400 million in grants. They're all tied up mostly, all of them. Minor changes will still happen, but this is money that has already been defined and defined. The additional funds in this perspective are from the REACT initiative, which I mentioned earlier, 330 million; and in this regard, we have also confirmed the amendment of the operational committee on October, which is now in the validation phase, nevertheless being implemented. However, this means that we have allocated these funds to areas where individual sectors or systems have been most affected, namely health, some 140 million euros, social protection and home care, and everything else about 90 million euros and the rest to the economy and education. The economy in particular in this sense – supporting businesses to start operating as quickly as possible after this crisis has ended. Then we have the area of agricultural policy, which is programmed according to their rules, a billion 600; and the area of the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027, 3 billion 200, which we are programming again according to the rules to be adopted, we are counting in the European Parliament in May this year. And the remainder is a billion 600, the recovery plan is irreversible; and the option is three billion 200 loans. And loans need to be cost-effective, rational and, of course, in accordance with the good-bore mechanism, when this mechanism is more favourable than Slovenia currently has through access to international financial markets, where the situation, because it has been successful in the economic field in coping with the crisis, currently owes a negative interest rate, which raises the question of how much this mechanism will eventually be used. But even if it doesn't, another mechanism will be used for the same purposes. The content is important, not the mechanism that we come from. That's why it's right to know we're talking about this job. Once again, this work, more than the funds available, is an important essential part of this reform. If we all agree together that there will be no objection to these changes, that we will understand that we have to make this move, then I believe that we will succeed further. Member of the Moon, I apologize. He can't get out of his skin. I can say it a hundred times. I think it's a lost cause. I think I can tell you a million times here what he's holding and what he's not holding, and the next time he gets a chance to tell behind the microphone, he's gonna cheat again, manipulate and so on. I regret this, but it makes no sense for me to repeat this communication, regardless of what is true and what is not, without the fact that it is not possible to reject the plan for two days before it even formally enters into force a regulation allowing investment and so on. However, I have said, and this is no secret, once again, that during all this period, communication was normally carried out at the level of the European Commission's official office through the competent Directorates, with the aim of clarifying, in technical-administrative terms, all uncertainties in this interim period and preparing a document which will ultimately, with as few formal complications, receive appropriate confirmations at the level of the European Commission. And we're not just doing this with this document, we've done this with REACT. There have also been at least eight discussions with REACT before we have put this document into the procedure; and similar planning for the next financial perspective. This is a normal dialogue that takes place at the level of the national authorities and the European Commission, with the aim of, of course, harmonising all uncertainties in previous procedures. And this dilemma that we're giving to the army of 780 million and only 202 million for health care at the RRF is not appropriate. This country needs both safety and health care, and long-term care, as well as access to youth services when they finish school, not to talk about everything else. But there's no question that if we don't put 780 for the army, then we'll give more for these areas. No, it's not, 'cause you can't do it without each other. There's nothing that super-managed systems can do if we're not safe. In addition, these funds have nothing to do with these funds allocated to other areas and other systems. And as far as health care is concerned, it must be said that this part is the part which, according to the structure of the resources that we have within the framework of a billion 600, is dedicated to this area. If we spent half a billion here, the rest of the areas would be undernourished. This is also why we combine these funds here with 140 million from REACT and with a national contribution, which means that in the next three to four years at least an additional 500 million euros will be provided for this area, half a billion. And you know that health bills weigh more than €3 billion a year. These are comparisons that sound populism-like, but they don't have some real weight. The question of why in the first version of the plan – I think Member Sukič asked me on the committee – was 140 for an infection in Ljubljana or Maribor, and now it is only 92. Yeah, look, at the end of the day, it's only going to be 80. Maybe only 80, it's important that we have a project defined by content. But since it's on the D.I.P. level, you know what that means. I do not know what the end value will be; but the definition is that health systems will be strengthened primarily in the part that is most important for the future and which should have been done years ago; and here, of course, both UKCs are key as a backbone of this public system and, of course, all the other hospitals in individual regions that have also been fed over the years. And when we talk in this part about nursing hospitals, where Slovenia is highly malnourished, if we are to make up for the late payment and provide people with normal services in this area, then we will also have to combine concession relations, public concession relations and public funds here, as in nursing homes. It won't be any different. And it is also right here to discuss this honestly and to see if there are any objections and why. I don't see them. These things need to be combined. Why? Since normal services should be provided to people as soon as possible, which should have been received years and years ago, they were not because things were going too slowly. Then there was a speech by Member Mesca about how these funds were squandered during – he spoke – 5,000 600 projects. He was talking about an existing financial perspective, an existing financial perspective. I have to say it's definitely a problem, but it's not just 5,000 600, it's significantly more, it's even more than 5,000 600. But in what area are these small projects? Not on these major investment projects and so on, but on the so-called soft work it is. But one part of this soft work is also things that are very important to people, such as project Employment.me or First Employment. This is about operations worth a few thousand euros, but through this they employ schoolchildren, first job, first job in kindergartens and so on. These scholarships are small projects, which are also financed by European money. For half a billion euros there are these funds. I don't know if I should understand that Member of the Moon believes that this should be deleted when he speaks of it being broken down into 5,000 600. It is not so much a problem that these small projects are; the problem is whether these funds are spent effectively. Some of them, some of them aren't. There is something similar about research, development and innovation. I said last time, some of the funds are, some are not; and speaking of billions for this area being insufficient, the efficiency of consumption and absorption is currently 20%. So obviously there is not too much of this, only this country so far has not been able to steer these funds in a smart way to ultimately add value to where it should be. Let's say in this perspective: Public scholarship, development fund – €116 million of European money, Employment Office – 348 million, half billion total. These are those little projects. And you know who they are? That's it. You've seen this picture before. Non-governmental funds in the last ten years, total 706 million. Here, too, are these small projects, such as those based only on Metelkov 6 - 37 million 800. These are projects where these are small funds and where it is not right that such significant funds are earmarked for certain content of which no added value is added. If value added here is no problem, but because it is not and because other areas have been nourished at the expense of this in the past, it is also necessary, through these reforms in the Plan for Recovery and Resistance of this scheme, to change and allocate funds for student homes, for the provision of elderly and home care, for health care, for better health services and so on, for the dwellings of the young people you are talking about. By the way, it is currently in construction and by the end of 2023 2 000 400 rental apartments will be delivered only through the Housing Fund of the Republic of Slovenia, and the plan by 2025 is an additional 3 000 700 apartments, with this number being in the RRF, only one part of the assets that provide this housing, the 180 million euros that Luka Mesec was talking about. And by the way, when you talk about what proportion of health resources we devote to the Recovery and Resistance Plan. Italy, where the government fell because they could not agree on a smart allocation of these funds, had an initial plan of 9.5 billion for health care, which is less than 5%. Now it has 19 billion, so still less than 10%. We currently have more than 10% of the health coverage foreseen and we are not specific within the European Union. So we have some jackals available, some kind of money quota that needs to be smartly distributed among the various purposes of spending; and we are doing so. It should also be known that one part of these funds can be spent by the end of 2023, the other by the end of 2026 and the third part by the end of 2029. And if some projects are not well prepared, this means that they do not allow this spending until this period, it is irresponsible to place them in these plans because they cannot be implemented; and therefore we combine them with all three or four mechanisms. As far as we are concerned, we are devoting too little of our support to entrepreneurship, as Member of the Moon has been talking about, and so on, that we should devote more to this area. In the last seven years, in 2020 there were at least seven years of bankruptcy in Slovenia. At least. Clearly, these measures have worked through the PKPs. Unemployment fell by more than three thousand in February, and the number of employees increased by more than 6 thousand 600 new employees. So these measures obviously worked and went in the right direction. With regard to the climate crisis and everything else that's involved. Here we differ in understanding the climate crisis as a process that does not take place for five or ten years or 20 years, but over thousands of years, millions of years. And this process is happening, and it will continue. That's a fact. And the funds that we have to make from this address are the means to deal with the consequences of what is happening. This does not mean that we are doing some studies and I do not know what, we are talking about some kind of climate justice. Those who talk about it don't know what it is; it's to address the problems that happen to us because of it. What, though, are these problems in Slovenia? Floods are one of those problems. The reptiles. And the funds in the plan are allocated to these areas. There will be earthquakes, there will be earthquakes, and there will be funds for this area. The rehabilitation of those buildings, which are already known today, that if there is a similar earthquake as it happened in neighbouring Croatia, we will have problems. As a result, we are earmarking funds for specific projects through which we will endeavour to prevent the possible consequences of these cases in advance. With regard to these general matters, I must say that we are not different. But we're different, like I said, in approach. I hope there's no objection to what I said last time on the board, but there's one theory, and the other is a practical approach, action. And I think we're in a situation where we need to go into action right now. Now, in my opinion, there is no more time for major studies, big strategies and I don't know what, this process of formal preparation of this document needs to be completed, we are running the last round, we will go through it successfully. I also hope that there will be no opposition on these core points, because otherwise we will have very serious difficulties in drawing funds from specific projects. I am speaking on the basis of the reforms needed to carry out the rest. Thank you."", ""Thank you very much. Respected citizens and citizens, the President of the Government, the Council of Ministers, distinguished representatives and representatives of the people, who in this Chamber of Democracy represent the will of all Slovenian citizens and citizens who decide on their behalf and represent our Slovenia at home and in the world. Let me tell you why I think a constructive distruster must succeed. We want investors of constructive non-trust to form a new government aimed at halting the denormalisation of the country. We do not trust investors in the current government, so we want to stop the failure to respect fundamental constitutional principles, stop the push of Slovenia into a group of countries with problems with respect for the rule of law, and stop the government's ineffective fight against the covid-19 pandemic. In our parliamentary history, investing in a constructive non-trust is very rare, rather an exception than a rule. This time, constructive distrust is put in particular because we are at a turning point for the future of our country. Citizens face the most dangerous pandemic in hundreds of years, and at the same time the efforts of the current government to enforce so-called authoritarian democracy. Today, February 15, 2021, in the year we celebrate 30 years of our country, the elected representatives of the people will decide between authoritarian Slovenia and normal, constitutional, democratic Slovenia. Your vote will say whether you are in favour of Slovenia of populism, which ignores the rule of law, disregards respect for human rights and respect for independent constitutional institutions, oppresses the freedom of the media and the autonomy of the university, and disregards the profession and scientific knowledge, or whether, honourable Members and Members, you will decide on a constitutional, democratic Slovenia that respects the generally accepted values set by our Constitution. Dear representatives of the people, you are not deciding on Karl Viktor Erjavac today. Today you decide whether you will allow the current government to continue to weaken the democratic gains we have built over the past 30 years. You will vote on this today in this temple of democracy, on behalf of all those who have entrusted you with this important mission of deciding on the future of Slovenia. Citizens want a normal Slovenia, they want a well-managed and well-managed Slovenia. Let us therefore ask together whether what is happening today in Slovenia is normal. After 11 months of operation of the current government, which was even a majority at the beginning, we clearly see that the Government is not pursuing the main objective of the welfare of citizens or implementing a coalition treaty for the benefit of all citizens, but is all subordinate to the transformation of the country into an authoritarian democracy. Where do you see it most today? In the fight against covid-19 epidemics, which often do not have a professional basis, but are purely political calculation. By imprisoning people to municipal borders, curfews and closing down educational institutions, the longest in Europe, the government has deliberately reached into important inalienable rights and freedoms of people. Experts strongly point out that these measures have no positive effects. They do not, of course, because the current government under the leadership of the SDS is pursuing with them another, the most important programme objective for it, namely the establishment of another republic. This thesis was not invented by me and not only by me but also by some of the most prominent newspapers, such as The New York Times and Le Monde. The authoritarian policy implemented by the President of the Government does not aim to strengthen the constitutional independent institutions, nor to strengthen media freedom and effective action in the pandemic, but rather, rather, weakens the constitution of an independent institution, subjugates the media and adopts such epidemiological measures that enable the achievement of narrow ideological client objectives. All of this is not only a political consequence, but also a profound legal and social impact. That's why there's uncertainty and fear in the country. Citizens do not know what measures they can expect the next day. Citizens are afraid for their jobs, for the education of their children. This government deepens uncertainty and fear among citizens also because there are no good solutions to the covid-19 pandemic. Many epidemiological statistics confirm that we are among the world's worst countries in the fight against the covid-19 pandemic despite the exceptional sacrifice of health and other personnel, even though we have a fairly well-developed health system on a global scale. This situation is not surprising, however, since all important decisions have been taken by the President of the Government, often beyond the opinions of the former Minister of Health and beyond the profession. The government is not only ineffective, it is still inconsistent in the implementation of its own measures once it has opened certain activities and closes them again within a few days without analysis and without taking account of the profession. Worse still, even their own ministers do not respect them – I will not cite cases because they are all very well known to you. Since it is ineffective and inconsistent in implementing measures, it also introduces censorship for the public performance of certain ministers and even experts who could raise awareness of the epidemic. With all this, it has fundamentally undermined the trust of people who are urgently needed to overcome the epidemic. Ladies and gentlemen, in this regard, I must touch on the testimony of the current Prime Minister of the Government that our submission of a constructive non-trust during the most difficult crisis due to the covid-19 pandemic is irresponsible behaviour and reluctance by the opposition. The combined opposition associated with the KUL coalition has been constructively supporting all meaningful solutions and measures to alleviate the pandemic all the time in the National Assembly. Finally, at the first wave, we were able to see them fly into victory over the Allied aircraft pandemic. Most of the cases related to the resolution of the pandemic were also supported by the opposition, but of course the solutions that had the opposite objective were not supported — only the achievement of some of the SDS' narrow ideological objectives. The public should be reminded that in each of the PKP packages, such promoters were. In short, in the National Assembly, neither the opposition nor the coalition partners prevented the government from doing what its President, the government, would normally do. This can also be illustrated by the fact that by mid-January, during the second wave, at the time of the worst pandemic, there was no intervention against ministers and ministers, although many would have earned it in view of the incompetent work. Therefore, the claim is that due to a constructive mistrust, the Government was unable to work successfully, untrue and misleading. With constructive confidence, we want to give Members and Members of the National Assembly an opportunity to elect a government; a government that will stop interference with independent democratic institutions; a government that will strengthen fundamental constitutional principles, the independence of constitutional institutions, the division of powers, the freedom of the university and the media; a government that will respect professionally not only the pandemic, but also in all areas of social and economic life. It is quite clear that failure to respect and deny the profession also leads to authoritarianism, which is seen by the current government practically every day. The new government's programming origins will not be based on captivating and kidnapping the state and its institutions, on hostility or authoritarianism, but on building mutual trust, including professions, strengthening public systems, connecting with civil society, strengthening open society and, in particular, providing solidarity to people who really need help, but not by dividing who is ours and who is not ours. Unlike the policy of the President of the Government of the Common Goals, we will not be pursuing a criminal policy that establishes absurdly high fines for citizens for violating non-life government decisions – let us remember the case of burek. The policy of the new government will not be a policy in which the President of the Government, together with the Minister of the Interior, uses a Twitter order to be dealt with by the police. Let us recall that it would be good for the police to deal with the presence of Karl Erjavac here for the purpose of issuing confidentiality regarding the draft Court of Auditors report. The policy of the new government will not be to establish a police state in which citizens will be treated selectively in principle, which is ours, and this is not. The policy of the new government will not be exclusive and will not threaten to forgive experts who do not have the same opinion as the government. The current government, unfortunately, does all that. Let me just mention the recent replacement of the State Secretary at the Ministry of Education and the case in this National Assembly, when one of the SDS Members requested that an adviser from the Legislative and Legal Service be dismissed because she did not follow the ruling policy by means of her professional legal opinion. In particular, the policy of the new government will work to strengthen the confidence of all three branches of government, to strengthen confidence in expertise and to strengthen confidence in scientifically proven knowledge. Unfortunately, even in this national assembly, we find bizarre views that climate change is a fraud and not a scientific fact. In particular, the policy of the new government will aim at strengthening the confidence of citizens and citizens. The policy of the new government is to make Slovenia a normal country again. Your Honor! The fact that the President of the Government is rounding down his position also shows the untruths he is saying about political crises during the pandemic. He says that there are no political and governmental crises anywhere in the world at this time, because the opposition around the world, in particular in Europe, is supposed to renounce causing government crises during the pandemic. The truth, of course, is different. Let me just list the news of the month of January: both the Dutch and the Italian governments have resigned, we already have a new Italian government, the Estonian Prime Minister has resigned, the Netherlands will continue elections in Bulgaria, and they were in Kosovo and Portugal yesterday. We also hear similar untruths about the functioning and decision-making of constitutional courts in Europe during the crisis. The President of the Government is prepared to charge even the Constitutional Court with failure to deal with the epidemic for suspending the implementation of the Investment Act in the Slovenian Army. You could all read a tweet with an official government stamp saying that the Constitutional Court is becoming a threat in terms of the ability of the state to function normally. The State Secretary at the Ministry of Health of the SDS quota, like the President of the Government, freely declares on national television that Slovenia is the only country to defend itself before the Constitutional Court on the issue of the epidemic. Let me explain only with the case of Germany, where the Constitutional Court has repeatedly referred to the measures of the epidemic, and it does not come to the attention of the High Representatives of the German Government to challenge the German Constitutional Court for deciding on matters relating to their actions during the pandemic. According to the National Bureau of Investigation, which undertook the spring purchase investigation, these are masks, respirators and the like, according to the Statistical Office, which did not follow the Government's expectations, according to the Court of Auditors, which drafted the report on spring acquisitions of protective masks and other medical equipment, the Constitutional Court is now clearly the institution to be discredited. Dear High Council, representatives of the people! Will you really let the current government weaken all the democratic pillars? Will you really allow this government to complete its project for the establishment of another republic by the end of this term? This is not what most of our citizens and citizens want, so I suggest you support a constructive mistrust. On this occasion, I should like to reiterate the fundamental values for you and for all our citizens, where, with the initiative for the Coalition of the Constitutional Loka, Dr. Jožet P. Damjan, for which I especially thank him, I have managed to obtain allies and many societies and also to unify the opposition's parties. These values are also the basis for which the Desus party joined the initiative. I would like you to accept these values as my pre-eminent commitment, that I will take them into account in the process of forming a new government and later in the daily hard work, and if you give me your trust today, I can say the following. First time. The government will deal with the covid-19 pandemic more effectively, more consistently and professionally. Another time. Inviolability of the principle of the division of power between the legislative, executive and judicial authorities. Third time. Combating poverty and inequality and social exclusion and ensuring a dignified age. Fourth time. The commitment to strengthen the independence of institutions key to the transparent functioning of the State, as well as public media, NGOs and civil society. Fifth. Stable and regular jobs with higher added value and predictable entrepreneurial environment with financial incentives for creative breakthroughs. Six. Returning the current profession to key state institutions and accounting by corruption. It's a week. Investing in the quality and accessibility of public health, education and long-term care systems. Eight. Stable and increased investment in science and culture and halting pointless investments in arms at a time when other priorities are important. Nine. Systemic solutions for full compatibility of Slovenia with the EU Green Agreement and digital transformation. Ten years. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in line with the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. Dear Members and Members! When I said a good year ago that I was withdrawing from politics and public life, I did not expect to speak before you here again, in the temple of democracy, about such important things that are happening in Slovenia. So let me be a little personal in my performance. A lot of people are asking me why I went back to politics. I believe that you did not want this in one part of this House, but I have returned with the motivation to contribute, with my experience and knowledge, to the best of my ability, so that the party Desus, which celebrates 30 years this year, will remain a parliamentary party. This decision has taken place in the midst of unpredictable epidemiological and political events, which unfortunately shake not only Slovenia, but the whole world. Our specificity is unfortunately that poor management of the pandemic is only the most obvious expression of the poor and ineffective work of the current government. The current government sees a solution to all problems mainly in the decision of the Prime Minister, and his decision is aimed at decommissioning the country and its subsystems. Everything that has been built in the last 30 years is, in the opinion of this Government, deplorable, intended to be the remains and settlements of the former country or deep country. With this logic, the current government wants to transform our Slovenia into an authoritarian democracy in which one person decides about all by means of absolute party discipline and absolute party affiliation. In the 2018 elections, the authorities of Desusa decided not to participate with the government in which the SDS is located. This decision by Desus was taken on the basis of our experience in participating in two governments with SDS. It has always proved, and today this is fully confirmed, that for the governments led by Janez Janša, it is not a key coalition contract, but how to satisfy coalition partners in order to be silent and satisfied and, at the same time, through the coalition agreement, through the will of coalition partners to achieve the main objective of the SDS party, this is a project of another republic. That's why even from coalition partners you can hear that it's not what's written in the coalition contract, it's what's going on outside the coalition contract. In this context, I would like to mention why I no longer wanted to participate in the SDS governments, even though the position of Vice-President of the Government was offered to me as the party's president, if they were in the coalition. Let me first mention Patria's case, because the SDS party has been constantly undermining my responsibility for this matter. It's true, in good faith, that everything is fine, I signed this contract. Later in court proceedings, I learned from the various documents and hearings that things were happening in the background of these cases, which would not have led to the signing of this treaty today. In a court of law, I have proved my innocence, both in the first and second stages. Despite the court's legal judgment that I have faithfully done my job, I still listen to SDS's findings that I am guilty only because I signed this contract. I'm sure I'll listen to these things today, too. It is interesting, however, that for example, the role of the President of the Government for a bad agreement, signed in Mokricah, regarding the foreign exchange deposits of the former Ljubljanska banka, is not problematic. There are still legal proceedings against the former Ljubljana Bank in Croatia today, and we are still paying the Croatian budget for the high amounts exhausted. Has anyone taken responsibility? Nobody. We do know, however, that this agreement has been designed to put an end to all lawsuits in Croatia and to settle with Slovenia. Let me also touch on the arbitral decisions establishing the border between Slovenia and Croatia. Everything since the referendum, the people's decision, has been made, we can see that the SDS and, unfortunately, Nova Slovenija have consistently reduced this democratic decision, if it is not the right solution, that even the final arbitration decision is bad, it does not offer those solutions. Of course, it is also not right for you to be able to resolve this arbitration despite the unacceptable communication of the arbitrator and the authorising officer. We know that I have listened all the time to the impression that I should have encouraged this communication myself, of course the competent authorities in the National Assembly have not found this because it was also not true, and I think the arbitrator has honestly said how this communication occurred. Now that an arbitral decision could be reached, we see that you sent the Foreign Minister to talk to Trst, where there was also a Croatian foreign minister and an Italian foreign minister, but we have seen that he was merely immotonating this event. Since then, we have seen that the Croatian Parliament has already declared exclusively the economic zone on the Adriatic, and we can only hope that your quiet diplomacy will not result because I have always heard that I have too long a language, even when I was the Foreign Minister, when I warned that we could be without access to the open sea. I hope that there will not be this silent diplomacy and its result simply by staying silent and without access to the open sea. I hope that doesn't happen. Dear Members and Members! I wonder how we will preside over the Council of the European Union in a few months. This concern is not only my concern, but unfortunately it is also expressed in Brussels. The Foreign Minister must explain that Slovenia does not belong to a group of countries having problems with the rule of law. I hope that you are aware in this National Assembly of the difficulties this may cause in the Presidency of the European Union. I wonder how the agreements in the European Trio will take place – Germany, Portugal and Slovenia – in particular with Portugal, which is planning a series of political and legislative steps to combat hate speech and also with regard to radicalisation processes through social networks. The Portuguese Government directly links this content with the issue of democracy. Or how should we seriously address the green plan and debate on the future of Europe if the President of the Government among his client confidants has climate change detractors. In the world, he strongly reflected the tweet by which the current President of the newly elected President of the United States referred to him as a weak president and thus wished for a general surprise with a completely non-diplomatic and tactless move. We can only ask ourselves how long it will take to recover the consequences of this reckless tweet. Probably this tweet does not contribute to increasing the reputation of Slovenia in the international space. But we can see from American experience what a policy of constant truth-making, media contempt, constant claim of stolen elections can do. We could all monitor what happened at the temple of democracy in Washington. Dear Members and Members! I hope you are aware that the policy of this government is leading Slovenia into a society of countries with which we have never seen eye to eye and which have different values. That is why I want you to give me the support I need today and thus allow me to form a new government that will complete a regular mandate and bring our country back to normal. I am running for office because I believe that I can successfully connect the Coalition of the Constitutional Lok with my knowledge and experience and that we can at the same time connect all the social forces that reject authoritarian aspirations of government in Slovenia and that will lead Slovenia forward, not in the times that we hope will never return. Allow me now to present a little more systematically those programming priorities around which the List of Marjan Šarca, Social Democrats, Left, Alenka Bratušek and Desus have reached an agreement and at the same time made a commitment to achieve them together. Our program is based on four pillars. We must build all four pillars equally. The four pillars of our programme are therefore health, solidarity, the environment and development. The first pillar — health. In health, it is not only about winning the epidemic and recovering from it, but it is about financial and organisational stabilisation of the public health system. A truly effective response to the covid-19 crisis means: firstly, increased capacity for emergency patients, both by number of beds and personnel and by technical equipment, as we still do not know what we can expect from the third wave; an effective reduction programme for lagging behind and waiting types and the normal functioning of all other public health and third time; a more appropriate award for health workers, in accordance with Article 11, point 39 of the Public Sector Collective Treaty. For all three priorities, we will mobilise EU funds under the recovery programme and the multi-annual financial framework, which makes it possible to be significantly more ambitious. In addition, we will financially strengthen the public health system by increasing the total public health funding by 3% of GDP by 2025. We will abolish supplementary health insurance and transfer it to compulsory health insurance. Second pillar – solidarity. The issue of solidarity is about ensuring the future for all generations. In this way, I can announce the Long-Term Care Act, the adoption of the Housing Law and the establishment of the Housing and Supply Infrastructure Fund, free urban transport for pensioners, a demographic fund for real pension fund financing, not for state property mixing, support to municipalities for the construction of kindergartens and schools for greater inclusion of children. The third pillar – the environment. In order to be able to draw on European funds for green and digital transformation, we plan the following measures: the Climate Policy Act, which will legislate the carbon neutrality target by 2050 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% by 2030. We need to implement a constitutional decision on the right to clean drinking water through the adoption of laws and regulations. By raising standards for co-incinerators and banning fracking, we will better protect the environment and human health. In order to better mobilise the EU's funding under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 and the recovery programmes 2020-2023, we will respect the priorities outlined above significantly better than the current government. Pillar Four — Development. Our alternative program is development-oriented. By 2025, the R & D budget will gradually increase by one percent of GDP. We will adopt the Law on Scientific Research and Innovation and establish a technology agency, simplify business operations and ensure more efficient bureaucracy. We will increase the funds for culture to at least 2.5 percent of the budget. We will not despise and insult the creators in culture, but promote high-quality creativity, take care of self-employed people and accelerate cultural infrastructure projects. Professional competences and references will be again crucial for the management of institutions. We will restore professional independence to the expert commissions for programming and project calls and restore dialogue with civil society. Finally, we will reshape the strategic priorities of foreign policy to build again on multilateral cooperation and solidarity and alliances with the founding members of the European Union, which insist on the rule of law, respect for human rights, media freedom. We will take care of the interests of citizens of Slovenia and Slovenian minorities around the world, as well as consistently respect the constitutional rights guaranteed to national minorities in Slovenia. Ladies and gentlemen, for these values and for such a vision, I ask you for your confidence. We will not be able to do anything on our own unless we are open to the best around us – in scientific circles, in research circles, in the economy, in public administration, in civil society in the country – and our fellow citizens abroad. The epidemic has taught us painfully how much we depend on citizens and citizens who are careful and committed to their work, which is often overlooked or even, in recent times, criticised. The epidemic has taught us the fate of public systems such as health care and education. The epidemic has taught us how much our young people want mutual association and contacts, knowledge, education and the development of their talents. And the epidemic has also taught us how the country works if it is governed by decisions that are unfriendly to people. Unfriendly government decisions, some not even declared in accordance with the Constitution and the law, force people to make difficult decisions and hardships, or to adapt to new realities or to remain silent, to persevere or to despair. This dilemma, which unfortunately faces our citizens and citizens daily, can be brought to an end by you, honourable Members and Members. I am sure that you will be rewarded in public with a great degree of approval for such a decision. This dilemma must have been the dilemma of coalition partners many times. I understand the perplexity of the President of the Modern Centre of Minister Zdravko Pozvalska, who may have recently believed that within the coalition he could prevent certain unilateral actions of the President of the Government, but events in recent weeks prove that the President of the Government is putting the Modern Centre Party in a completely subordinate position. Let me remind you of just a few examples. The relevant report of the Ministry of Justice on the state of justice was supplemented before sending to Brussels without the conduct of the Minister of Justice by the Foreign Minister, assessing that the situation is different from what the competent justice ministry reports. The Commissioner-in-Office of the European Commission may have been surprised by this unusualness, since he is very well aware of the situation in Slovenia, and he was, last but not least, the Belgian Commissioner for seven or more years of foreign minister, he was also in Slovenia several times. Something similar happened with a letter from the Prime Minister addressed to Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen about allegedly stolen parliamentary elections in Slovenia, which also flew directly to the great victory of the Modern Centre Party in 2014, then under the name of the Mir Cerar Party. When two Commissioners, both members of the ALDE, turned to the Slovenian government about the STA, the Prime Minister of the Government restored the tweet of Vaneta Gošnik that it was not the European Commission, but only two women. Finally, the President of the Government illustrated his coalition partner, the Modern Centre Party, with the recent ultimatum of the Minister of Education for the immediate replacement of the Secretary of State for his disobedience. All these cases unfortunately confirm me when I say that no one will stop the President of the Government from his unilateral policy and that the Modern Centre Party will not be able to do so, so also the Desus party does not want to participate in such a coalition. Dear Members and Members, you will lose nothing if you trust me with your voice and much will be gained by Slovenia. I promise you that the new government will complete its regular mandate and that we will take Slovenia together on a normal path. I am sure that you are expected not only by those citizens who have entrusted you with the voice, but also by all the citizens who did not participate in the last parliamentary elections because they did not expect policy to influence their everyday lives. In the end, I would like to say to all of you, citizens and citizens, that I assure you that I will lead a different policy than the current Prime Minister. Our policy will be open and inclusive. I am willing to make available all my knowledge, experience and energy for your well-being. I have absolutely no political calculations, but a clear picture and a sincere desire to put a stop to this wrong policy taken together by the current government. Once again, today you are not deciding whether Karl Viktor Erjavec will be a mandate holder or he will form a government; today we are deciding which country we want and most citizens want a different country. Thank you for your attention and support.""]","<|system|>

What I do remember is that a lot of people expressed a view on what public opinion was over climate protesters and people who threw statues into the water at Bristol, but when cases came up before a jury, they reached some very interesting decisions on guilt or otherwise. That suggests that some of those who profess to know what public opinion is may not necessarily be right when the public have a chance to hear the arguments presented to them and are then asked to make a decision Clause 11 is about differential treatment of recognised refugees and its impact and implications. We believe that it contravenes the 1951 refugee convention. It sets a dangerous precedent by creating a two-tier system for refugees, and it is also inhumane. Under the Bill, the Home Secretary will be given sweeping powers to decide asylum cases based on how someone arrives in this country and their mode of transport, not on the strength of their claim—contrary to the 1951 refugee convention, of which Britain was a founding member Under the clause, only those refugees who meet specific additional requirements will be considered group 1 refugees and benefit from the rights currently granted to all refugees by the refugee convention. Other refugees who are not deemed to meet those criteria will be designated as group 2 refugees, and the Secretary of State will be empowered to draft rules discriminating against group 2 refugees with regard to the rights to which they are entitled under the refugee convention, as well as their fundamental right to family unity. The different ways in which those two groups could be treated is not limited in any way by the Bill. Clause 11 does, however, provide examples of ways in which the two groups might be treated differently, even though they are nearly all recognised as genuine refugees. Those who travel via a third country, who do not have documents or who did not claim asylum immediately will routinely be designated as group 2 refugees. The clause goes on to set out how the length of limited leave, access to indefinite leave, family reunion —that is, whether family members, mainly women and children, are entitled to join them—and access to public funds are likely to become areas for discrimination against group 2 refugees The government policy paper, the New Plan for Immigration, proposed that instead of fully fledged refugee status, group 2 refugees will be granted “temporary protection” for a period of no longer than 30 months, “after which individuals will be reassessed for return to their country of origin or removal to” a safe third country. Temporary protection status “will not include an automatic right to settle in the UK, family reunion rights will be restricted and there will be no recourse to public funds except in cases of destitution”— in other words, a state, deliberately created, of complete uncertainty over their future for group 2 refugees Clause 11 would therefore make a significant and unprecedented change in the law, resulting in the UK treating accepted refugees less generously, based on the journey they have taken to reach the UK and the timeliness of their asylum claim. This attempt to create two different classes of recognised refugee is surely inconsistent with the refugee convention and has no basis in international law. The refugee convention, which was enshrined in UK law in 1954, contains a single unitary definition of “refugee”. It defines a refugee solely according to their need for international protection because of feared persecution on the grounds of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Anyone who meets that definition and is not excluded is a refugee and entitled to the protection of the refugee convention The Commons committee considering the Bill heard in evidence from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ representative to the UK that this clause and the Bill were inconsistent with the UN convention and international law. If the Government disagree with that—an issue raised by my noble friend Lady Lister —no doubt they will spell out in some detail in their reply their legal argument for saying that the clause does comply with the convention and international law This is, however, not just a matter of law but of fairness and humanity. By penalising refugees for how they were able to get to the UK, the Bill builds walls against people in need of protection and shuts the door on many seeking a safe haven. Most refugees have absolutely no choice about how they travel. Is it really this Government’s intention and desire to penalise refugees who may, for example, as a matter of urgency, have had to find an irregular route out of Afghanistan? Are the Government saying that people are less deserving if they have had to take a dangerous route to our shores? Is an interpreter from Afghanistan who took a dangerous journey to our shores less deserving than a refugee who was lucky enough to make it here on one of the flights out of the country The Government acknowledge that such journeys are very dangerous and sometimes fatal, yet they do not seem to appreciate the compulsion—that the alternative of not doing so is even worse—which drives people to make such journeys. If people truly had a reason to believe that they would be safe where they are, they would not make the journey. Simply making the journey more dangerous or the asylum system more unwelcoming will not change that. Of the first 5,000 people who came in 2020 by boat, well over 90% were deemed by the Home Office to be eligible to apply for asylum: they were genuine asylum seekers. They were not here illegally—but they will become illegal if the Bill is enacted Penalising people for how they arrived in the UK has particular implications for already vulnerable groups of refugees such as women and those from LGBT communities. Women are often compelled to take irregular routes to reach safety, as we see only too clearly in Afghanistan. There are simply no safe and legal routes. Under the proposed changes, however, women who arrive irregularly, including through a safe third country, will be penalised and could be prosecuted, criminalised and imprisoned. The same obstacles will apply to those from LGBT communities Unless the Government can provide safe routes, penalising people for making unsafe journeys is simply inhumane, although, even then, not everyone would have the time or ability to access a safe route, even if one existed. By not providing safe routes, the Government are also fuelling the business model of the people smugglers they claim their proposals will destroy, and then penalising the victims they have had a responsibility for creating. The Conservative-led Foreign Affairs Committee, of which the Home Secretary was then a member, warned in 2019: “A policy that focuses exclusively on closing borders will drive migrants to take more dangerous routes, and push them into the hands of criminal groups” The Government’s impact assessment warns that increased deterrence in this manner “could encourage these cohorts to attempt riskier means of entering the UK. ” As has been said, Clause 11 also says that group 1 refugees must have “come to the United Kingdom directly from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened” In other words, the Government are setting an expectation that, to be recognised as a refugee supposedly deserving of the support usually afforded, the UK must be the first safe country in which they have sought asylum. Commenting on the Bill, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said: “Requiring refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach would undermine the global, humanitarian, and cooperative principles on which the refugee system is founded. ” It was pointed out in oral evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights that it was unlikely that “any country close to the main countries of origin of refugees would have ever considered signing a convention if that meant that they would assume total and entire responsibility for all the refugees. ” In addition, when the refugee convention came into being in the early 1950s, there was little or no commercial air travel, so any refugee reaching this country would have to have crossed land borders from safe states. Yet there was no view then that such a refugee should be seen—as under this Bill and the Government’s interpretation of the refugee convention in international law—as a criminal liable to up to four years in prison and to being sent back to France, and with any claim for asylum being regarded as inadmissible Even within Europe, most of the countries that refugees pass through on their way to the UK already host significantly more refugees and asylum seekers per population than the UK does. According to the Home Office’s own statistics, the UK is 17th in terms of the numbers it takes, measured per head of population. Unless safe routes are developed, all that will happen is that there will be an increase in dangerous crossings, because that will be the only way in which people can reach the United Kingdom. As it is, France takes three times more asylum seekers than the UK, as does Germany. Global provision for refugees could not function if all refugees claimed asylum in the first safe country they came to. As my noble friends Lord Griffiths of Burry Port and Lord Coaker have pointed out, most refugees are hosted in developing countries and the UK receives fewer asylum applications than most other European countries. Under international law, the primary responsibility for identifying refugees and affording international protection rests with the state in which an asylum seeker arrives and seeks that protection Clause 11 sets out a non-exhaustive list of the ways in which refugees who arrive irregularly and become group 2 refugees may be treated differently. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that the purpose of this is “to discourage asylum seekers from travelling to the UK”, and to encourage “individuals to seek asylum in the first safe country they reach after fleeing persecution. ” It is not clear, since the Government have provided no explanation, how the stated aim will result from the policy; perhaps the Government in their response will provide that explanation Evidence from many refugee organisations suggests that refugees seek asylum in the UK for a range of reasons, such as proficiency in English, family links or a common heritage based on past colonial histories. In addition, refugees do not cite the level of leave granted or other elements of the asylum system as decisive factors. The Home Office’s own study from 2002—I do not think there has been one since then—noted that there was little evidence that respondents seeking to come to the UK had a detailed knowledge of UK asylum procedures, benefit entitlements or the availability of work in the UK. There was even less evidence that the respondents had a comparative knowledge of how these conditions varied between different European destination countries Given that individuals have little knowledge of the asylum systems of the countries they end up in, it is not clear that differential treatment will dissuade individuals from coming to the UK via safe countries. However, what the Government are proposing will certainly result in a refugee population that is less secure, and it will punish those who have been recognised through the legal system as needing international protection, such as women and girls fleeing the Taliban or Uighurs fleeing genocide in China The Explanatory Notes also state that 62% of asylum claims in the UK up to September 2019 were from people who entered irregularly. This means that the policy intention is to impose strictures on the rights and entitlements of the majority of refugees coming to the UK, even though we take fewer than comparable countries. Those penalties would target not just those who have entered the UK irregularly or have made dangerous journeys but all those who have not come directly to the UK, regularly or irregularly, from a country or territory where their life or freedom was threatened, those who have delayed claiming asylum or overstayed, and even those who arrive in the UK without entry clearance and who claim asylum immediately.', 'My Lords, I declare my interests as a trustee of the charity Arise and as co-chair or officer of a number of relevant all-party groups. Seven years ago, I opened a Cross-Bench debate on the challenge posed by the wave of refugees leaving Africa and Asia and pleaded for a co-ordinated, urgent international response. I thank my noble friends for once again recognising the importance of this subject, and express my thanks to all noble Lords speaking today, especially the Minister, and to the Library for its excellent briefing note The debate is about push factors rather than the pull factors, which have dominated the consideration that we have been giving to the Nationality and Borders Bill. The Motion draws attention to the estimate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that 82.4 million people are displaced worldwide, 42% of whom are children and 32% of whom are refugees. It calls for an urgent international response to address the root causes, recognising that this is a complex strategic problem which cannot be addressed without systematic and sustained international co-operation Those push factors involve wars and conflicts, persecution and terrorism, destitution, corruption, instability, grinding poverty, man-made phenomena such as climate change, and natural disasters, which drive people out of their homes, communities and countries, risking their lives in doing so. It is about people such as Harem Pirot, a 25-year-old Iraqi Kurd, one of 27 people, mostly Iraqi Kurds, who perished five weeks ago in the world’s busiest shipping lane, having set off from the coast of northern France in a flimsy dinghy. It is about Khazal Ahmed and her three children, who also perished that day in the biggest known number of fatalities in one channel tragedy since refugees began making the perilous journey to Britain. It is about people being displaced from Afghanistan, Burma, Tigray, Nigeria, Venezuela, Eritrea, Syria, Iraq and Sudan, or illegally repatriated by China to North Korea To keep our own position in perspective, just 0.65% of the world’s refugees are in the United Kingdom. We take about half the number of asylum seekers that we took 20 years ago. By contrast, the top five countries hosting refugees have more than 9 million in their territories. Of the 82 million displaced people, 55 million are said to be living in internal displacement because of conflict or displacement. Conflict in Syria is in its 12th year. There are 13.5 million displaced Syrians, representing more than half of Syria’s population; 6.7 million Syrian refugees are hosted in 128 countries; and 80% of all Syrian refugees are in neighbouring countries such as Turkey but, like Belarus, its record in using refugees as cannon fodder, and in creating them in the first place, is appalling Two years ago, I visited Bardarash refugee camp in northern Iraq, where Kurdish families from Syria had fled after their homes were bombed by Turkish aeroplanes. A mother of four told me that “the war planes came at four o’clock. As they dropped their bombs and chemicals many children were burnt. Some were killed. We all started to run. I just want to go home with my children, but everything was destroyed, and we would be slaughtered. ” Another Bardarash refugee, Hamid, described how he saw people choking as their homes were burned: “Children were throwing up and we had to leave the injured behind as we fled. ” Hamza, whose wife, mother of their three year-old daughter, was killed, asked me: “Where is the justice in letting Erdoğan force Kurdish families to flee their homes? The international community did nothing about it. ” When did it become acceptable for a NATO country to break the Geneva conventions and, potentially, the chemical weapons convention, illegally occupy territory, ethnically cleanse a population and face no investigation, little censure, no Security Council resolution and no consequences? Does it matter that such actions add to the millions of people already caught up in such miserable displacement, denying them the chance just to go home As one of the four sponsors of the 2016 amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, on child refugees, it particularly disturbs me that of the 82 million displaced people, 42% are children. Children make up almost 25% of those seeking asylum in the UK and almost half of all identified potential victims of modern slavery or exploitation in our own national referral mechanism. Nelson Mandela was right when he observed: “The true character of a society is revealed in how it treats its children. ” When a Kurdish child drowns in the English Channel, a Syrian child drowns in the Aegean, or an Eritrean or Nigerian child drowns in the Mediterranean, we must ask what drives families and their children to such desperation? Some refugees spend their entire lives in sprawling, squalid, makeshift camps. Some I visited decades ago are still there As a young MP I travelled to Lebanon with the late Lord Avebury. In 1981 we visited Palestinian refugee camps at Shatila and Sabra, where a terrible massacre occurred in 1982. Those camps, two of 68 Palestinian refugee camps, were a perfect breeding and recruiting ground for terror, sucking up people who believed that the future held nothing for them. Shatila, Sabra, Bardarash and places like them are a symbol of the breakdown of global leadership. Millions are paying the price of our abysmal failure to hold perpetrators of atrocities to account In Northern Iraq, I met some of the displaced religious and ethnic minorities, including Yazidis, Assyrians and Chaldean Christians, displaced from the Nineveh Plains, Mosul, Sinjar and elsewhere during the ISIS genocide. Despite the best efforts in 2016 of my noble friend Lady Cox, the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, and myself, we failed to persuade the Government that a genocide was under way and there is still no ad hoc tribunal to bring to justice those responsible. The veteran diplomat, Dr Richard Haass, is right that in a world of bad options, “not acting can be every bit as consequential as acting” The abysmal failure to act on genocide and atrocity crimes is a major push factor in creating displacement, from Burma to northern Nigeria and from Tigray to Somalia. In Afghanistan, the chaotic withdrawal of the US and the return to power of Taliban death squads has resulted in thousands of people fleeing, whether in official state and NGO-organised evacuations or by resorting to smugglers and human traffickers. The most at risk include thousands of people from religious or belief minorities, including small groups of Christians, Sikhs, Ahmadis, Uighurs and others substantial in number, such as the Hazara Shias. Women are generally at risk, especially those who have been in powerful positions, including women judges, lawyers and politicians, and women in medicine, education and journalism. The list goes on The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, will speak later. She has done such admirable work, with a Kindertransport-inspired airlift of 103 at-risk women and their families—close to 500 people airlifted on private charter planes to Greece, which has been a lily pad. However, as their temporary visas come to expire, countries such as the UK continue to delay implementing their promised resettlement programme. Can the Minister tell us what has caused the delay and when it will be resolved Can he also spell out how he is responding to the Bishop of Truro’s 2019 report, commissioned by the then Foreign Secretary? It found that in some regions the “level and nature” of the persecution of Christians was “arguably coming close to meeting the international definition of genocide according to that adopted by the UN”. What assessment has the Minister made of FoRB as a driver pushing refugees such as the Pakistani Ahmadis and Christians, whom I have seen for myself in refugee detention centres in south-east Asia? Will he tell us what is being done by our embassies to help resettle religious minorities and what priority is being given to combating persecution and upholding Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a major push factor all over the world In south-east Asia, I also visited Karen refugee camps established decades ago, which are now seeing new influxes as Burmese ethnic minorities are subjected to fierce attacks by the Tatmadaw following their illegal coup. Many are living on the run in the jungles of Myanmar. In Burma, I met Rohingya Muslims and visited a burned-out village. Even before the coup, 800,000 Rohingya Muslims were subjected to genocide and forced to flee to Bangladesh, while Christian minorities in Chin state and elsewhere have been, and continue to be, subjected to terrible atrocity crimes. Will the Government consider providing urgently needed humanitarian aid to internally displaced peoples through cross-border delivery In autumn 2020, the noble Lord, Lord Collins, and I raised in this House the consequences of the conflict in Tigray. One year later, just before Christmas, the United Nations Human Rights Council established a UN inquiry that will monitor the crimes and preserve the evidence for future generations, with notable votes cast against doing that by China, Russia and Eritrea. Welcome though that motion is, it will do nothing to reverse the mass displacement of 2 million people forced to flee their homes. Hundreds of thousands of people are in famine-like conditions and are starving. The catastrophic conflict continues to expand, devastating the whole region. If the political will had been there, these atrocities, the pain, suffering, displacement and much more besides could have been prevented Meanwhile, the World Bank and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, along with the Minister himself in evidence given at a recent hearing of the International Relations and Defence Select Committee, have warned that rising sea levels and climate change will displace millions more. Post COP 26, how are we preparing to meet that challenge? How are we ensuring that displaced people and refugees, already at the bottom of the pile, are receiving Covid vaccinations—a point raised by my noble friend Lord Hylton during Questions today—and are not part of what the United Nations High Commission for Refugees calls “a substantial vaccine equity gap” What assessment have we made of its estimate that 30 million more people will be facing hunger by the end of this decade than if the pandemic had not occurred? A point often referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, and others is our cuts to overseas aid, the subject of a Cross-Bench debate on 1 July 2021. That, for many, has been a final blow The UK has some generous and worthwhile initiatives, but clearly we cannot meet these interlinked challenges alone or by hoping that the problem will simply go away. It will not. With our allies, global Britain needs to drive this issue right up the international agenda. We should be convening summits, commissioning hard-headed humanitarian solutions, tackling the problem at its roots and creating secure, safe havens in which people can prosper and make new lives. We need something on the imaginative scale of the US-inspired 1948 Marshall aid programme, which rebuilt western Europe Along the coast of north Africa, we should be building new Carthages—a series of new, UN-protected, small city states—using brilliant Israeli and other western technology to create renewable energy for water desalination, electricity and the production of food. If this was done under a UN mandate, it might turn the UN into something other than a spectator Instead of a well-thought-out international plan of action, we have near silence in the UK’s 2021 integrated review. If we are to be what the review calls “a force for good”, we need to turn the rhetoric into deeds. In addition to the altruistic reasons for doing so, the Government should follow the logic of their own argument when they say that, for the cost of helping 3,000 refugees who arrive in Britain, the UK could help 100,000 refugees in camps overseas. It is what the Norwegian Government do; their Minister for Immigration and Integration, Sylvi Listhaug, believes not only that the rich world has a moral duty to help refugees but that the deployment of 1% of its GDP on foreign aid should be used to tackle the refugee problem at source. Other countries should be persuaded by us, but we need to lead by example It is an echo of a remark made in a debate in 1940 by the formidable independent MP, Eleanor Rathbone, who established the Parliamentary Committee on Refugees and argued that responding to the plight of refugees was “not only in the interests of humanity and of the refugees, but in the interests of security itself”. —[Official Report, Commons, 10/7/1940; col. 1212. ] Today’s Motion is about facing up to the global duty to understand why mass migration is rapidly on the rise and how we in the rich North need to respond not by endless barriers but by serious and intentional economic, social and democratic investment to support building lives of dignity, way beyond our borders. It is in their interests and in the common interests of humanity, but it is in our interests too. If we fail to do this, there will be many more fatal tragedies, many more Harem Pirots and Khazal Ahmeds. There will be many more camps, and many more lives devoid of human dignity and opportunity. I beg to move.', ""We are facing a more challenging foreign and security policy situation than for a long time. Fortunately, the picture is not unique. We took part in important progress in 2015 with a new and ambitious climate agreement, nuclear agreement with Iran, progress in the WTO and decisions on new global sustainability targets. Several underlying trends are also positive: global poverty is reduced, more children receive education and better health care, and economic growth continues in both Asia and Africa. But at the same time, we are experiencing increased vulnerability – a feeling that the word we have built in Europe and globally in the last decades is brittle than we thought. In Europe’s southern neighbourhoods there are several areas of war and conflict. From North Africa and Sahel via the Middle East to Afghanistan, it is a belt of vulnerable states struggling with radicalisation and violent extremism as well as weak government governance and high unemployment — not least among young people. More than 100,000 people were killed last year in war and conflict. That's the highest number over the age of 25. Over 60 million people are fleeing the world, and that's the highest number since World War II. 125 million people in the world are in urgent need of humanitarian aid because of war, hunger and poverty. The ISIL terrorist organisation affects the civilian population in Syria and Iraq, most recently with several brutal attacks in recent days that have taken over 100 lives. ISIL is also strongly present in Libya. At the same time, ISIL’s deeds have hit civilians in Europe – from the Paris concert hall to the Copenhagen synagogue. We are facing a more self-reliant and unpredictable Russia, both in the east and in Syria. European cooperation is being put to the test of migration, economic crises, the threat of terrorism and the pressure on international rules of the game. Geographical distances are less and less remote from problems. 2014 and 2015 were demanding years in Norwegian foreign and security policy. But we have to steel ourselves to make 2016 even harder. The seriousness of foreign policy is therefore the guiding principle of the year’s presentation. The seriousness is also the background to the recent launch by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Choice project. It will analyse and stimulate debate on the challenges we face and formulate options for action in foreign and security policy. We need to be clear about what is in Norwegian interest. We have to distinguish between vital, important and other interests. We have to realize that we can't do everything. We have to search with others to find broad solutions. And we must have the will, the ability and the efficiency of diplomatic tools to pursue the vital interests. European countries have always been Norway’s close neighbours and main trading partners. Besides the United States, they're our most important friends and allies. Together with the United States, they are also our main political partners to preserve and strengthen not only regional but also global values and rules of play. Norway is part of the European Community of destiny. When young people were attacked in Paris last fall, in another senseless terrorist attack on our common values, we were also hit. We have clearly shown this in solidarity with France in the same way that the French clearly indicated their solidarity with us after the tragedy that struck Norway on 22 July 2011. Political, economic and most societal areas — what is happening in Europe — have a direct impact on Norway. Therefore, Norwegian foreign policy begins in Europe — in a Europe that is challenged both from the outside and from the inside. In the past, the EU has proved itself to be strengthened by crises. It is essential that the European Union also succeeds this time. A weak and fragmented EU will weaken Europe's security. It is in our interest that the European Union should be as united as possible and that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own security. Together, the EU and NATO have a wide range of instruments. There is no contradiction between European and Atlantic orientation in Norwegian foreign policy, on the contrary. Many today demand a common vision of how to further develop the EU. Some countries want closer integration, while others focus on national solutions. The choices made by the Member States will have a long way to go in the future. It is a crossroads for Europe when a central Member State initiates a process that can end up withdrawing from EU cooperation. The new agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom could have implications for the further interpretation and development of basic principles in cooperation. It will also affect us. Norway is serving a strong EU with continued British membership. The challenges must be met with leadership, cooperation and solidarity. It is Europe's strength and in our interest. Let me address some of the key challenges facing Europe in the future: The waves of refugees and migration towards Europe challenge European cooperation. Last year, over a million people came to Europe. Inflows have also been high in recent months. The critical phase was not necessarily last year. The critical phase may lie ahead of us if the influx via Turkey and Libya does not slow down. The wear and tear has been enormous in those countries that have so far borne the greatest responsibility for the flow of refugees: Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Turkey is at a crossroads. The country faces major challenges with increased levels of conflict and violence and pressures against human rights. Europe is completely dependent on good cooperation with Turkey – in the short term due to migration pressures and in the longer term because we need a stable Turkey as an important regional player in a very unstable area. Turkey is NATO's southern flank. Europe must engage and support Turkey in today's difficult situation, while passing on clear political expectations to Ankara. Greece has been experiencing deep political and economic crises in recent years, and the Middle East migration wave puts the country under increasing pressure. Europe must make clear demands, but also help to help Greece out of the crisis. We need to expand our perspective to find the roots of the migration crisis. War and collapse of state structures in the Middle East and North Africa and lack of international crisis management are some of the reasons. Demographic trends in the Middle East and Africa are also taking place – with population growth, poverty and conflict. The population in both the Middle East and Africa has quadrupled since 1950. According to forecasts, both will double again towards 2050. Then Africa will have two billion people. Already today, 12 million African young people enter the labour market every year. If these rapidly growing youth schools do not see opportunities in their own countries, more will be tempted to embark on a dangerous journey towards Europe. Many refugees from war and conflict, others seeking a better life. Therefore, the government gives economic growth, education and job creation top priority in development policy. The migration crisis affects the social debate, policy, budgets and economy of almost all European countries. Freedom of travel in the Schengen area requires pan-European rules for the definition of the country responsible for examining asylum applications. These rules are laid down in the Dublin III Regulation. Norway wants clear rules. Similarly, Norway wishes third-country nationals who enter the Schengen area without valid documents to be registered and fingerprinted and entered into European computer systems. This provides a basis for applying the common rules on liability and reduces the scope of secondary movements. This is in Norwegian interest. In recent years, the Dublin Code has not been applied mainly because many asylum seekers have not been registered in their previous countries. Norway supports legislative and policy changes that ensure that the Dublin system is followed up and that migrants are registered in the first Schengen country they arrive. A future European asylum system must aim to ensure a more balanced distribution of asylum seekers than is the case today, and that all countries take their share of responsibility. Norway and Greece have recently agreed to use another 31 million. EUR from the EEA funds to strengthen the Greek asylum system until 2017. The government wants a strict and fair policy to deal with refugees and migration anchored in effective international cooperation and the values on which our society is based. We must combat tendencies towards racism and xenophobia. It is important that we get common European solutions. Origin, transit and recipient countries need to cooperate on robust and long-term solutions. We need to strengthen the development and growth of countries of origin, measures against organised crime and trafficking in human beings and measures against illegal and irregular migration. Migration is a challenge that has come to be. Foreign policy plays an important role, and we strengthen our diplomatic efforts in terms of migration both at home and at a number of foreign stations. The development, security and stability of long-standing civil wars and brutal behaviour of violent extremist groups are threatened along the southern border of Europe. This is the second challenge I highlight today. Some conflicts have occurred for a long time. Norway has a long-standing commitment to a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, also through our Presidency of the AHLC donor country group. But it's the civil war in Syria that fires the region. It has now been here for five years. Over 300,000 people are killed. Millions are driven into flight, and millions of new desperate acids may flee if war is not replaced by peace. A few years ago, Syria was an intermediate country. Now cities are reduced to gravel eggs. What took five years to destroy can take five decades to rebuild. The agreement on the stoppage of the fighting that was launched on Saturday is very important, not least for the millions of civilians who have suffered during the brutal warfare of the last few years – not least the children. Three million Syrian children inside Syria are not going to school today. They can easily be a lost generation. It is the responsibility of all parties, not least the Syrian regime and their Russian supporters, to comply with the ceasefire and to contribute to giving room for genuine peace negotiations. There is also a positive consensus to allow humanitarian aid consignments to all parts of Syria, including those that have been excluded from this. The UN mission to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, has notified the United Nations Security Council that he intends to bring the parties back to the negotiating table on 7 March. It will be positive if the difficult work on a political solution can now be started seriously. Norway provides all possible support in this work. Especially ISIL, but also groups like Jabhat al-Nusra and Al-Qaeda, represent ideology and brutality that are inhuman. Norway contributes significantly to the fight against ISIL. We have deployed military personnel in Iraq and are an active member of the nuclear coalition against ISIL. Military efforts have produced results. In Iraq is 40 pst. of land areas controlled one year ago by ISIL, now liberated, including important cities such as Tikrit and Ramadi. However, military instruments alone do not resolve the underlying causes of ISIL’s existence as a state collapse and the lack of inclusion of the Sunni population in Iraq. The fight against ISIL must be fought on a broad front. We give priority to the prevention and management of threats from foreign fighters. We will continue our efforts to fight ISIL financially, and ensure that they are neither sold oil nor given new supplies. At the same time, we take great responsibility for the desperate humanitarian situation. The Norwegian-initiated donor country conference in London contributed to a great humanitarian uplift for Syria. Never before has the world community collected so much in one day. The last numbers that came yesterday show over 12 billion. U.S. dollars. The Prime Minister also announced during the London meeting that Norway would spend about 10 billion. Over four years of humanitarian aid to Syria and neighbouring countries. Never before has Norway given so much money to a humanitarian crisis. The extent of suffering and the absence of political will to solve it call for massive humanitarian efforts. The Syria Conference must also be seen in the context of the major conference on education last year in Oslo. Through the training initiative, Norway has taken a global leadership to ensure education for all children. Education is a key field of action, both in humanitarian aid and in other development policies. Our priorities include: education for girls and the most vulnerable children. We are about to reach the goal of doubling Norwegian education aid. We have also initiated a global Commission to make recommendations on how to provide more funding for education – through national resource mobilisation, more and better assistance, new partnerships and innovative funding mechanisms. Education is not only essential for combating poverty, promoting equality and achieving sustainable development; a schooling site also shortens the road back to normal life in today’s conflict areas. With access to education, children and young people will regain hope for the future. The third challenge is Russia. Russia continues to be oriented away from democratic and liberal values. We see a more unpredictable Russia, where the will to surprise and take foreign policy risks is greater than before. We have condemned Russia's violations of international law in Ukraine and will continue to be associated with our allies and like-minded partners on the reactions to Russia's actions in Crimea and Donbass. We expect all parties to contribute to the fulfilment of the Minsk agreements. And we support Ukraine's reform work politically and financially. In Syria, we are concerned about Russia's increasingly offensive military support for Assad. We experienced until the last weekend massive bombing of opposition groups, which have also given rise to great civilian losses. But we have seen fewer attacks on ISIL, which the entire world community agrees to fight. The situation is further exacerbated by the tension between Russia and NATO Turkey. It is essential to avoid escalating through actions or rhetoric. Russia is our neighbour, and the neighbourhood is a constant and important factor in Norwegian foreign policy. We want a good neighbourly relationship with Russia. This is best achieved by sticking to our Russian policy. Norway shall be predictable, consistent, firm and clear to Russia. We will promote cooperation and contact where there is a common interest, and we will continue to stand up for our values, principles and interests. We seek to maintain good practical cooperation and constructive dialogue with Russia, where possible. This is particularly important in the north. The influx of migrants and asylum seekers across our common border in the north last autumn posed us with a challenging challenge. Through contacts and cooperation based on previously concluded agreements, we found solutions. Both Norway and Russia have served with orderly and stable conditions in border areas. Like allies, we have suspended military cooperation, but cooperation on coastguards, border guards, fisheries management and search and rescue works well. The open line between the Defence Operational Headquarters and the North Fleet is important. In September, Norway and Russia signed a protocol on practical procedures for alerting nuclear incidents under our bilateral alert agreement. Good and open channels are important when meeting challenges that require common solutions. They're also important to be clear from when we disagree. There is no contradiction between maintaining proper bilateral interests in relations with Russia and at the same time – together with our allies and partners – upholding international law and defending important international principles for international relations. So to the fourth European challenge: economic change. Economic growth in Europe is still too weak and unevenly distributed. There is little room for economic action and lack of demand and investment. Unemployment is still high in many countries. The uncertainty factors are many. At the same time, significant changes are taking place in the world economy. We are closely following the economic development in China, the second largest economy in the world, in the hope that the country will not be in favour of a ‘hard landing’ that will have consequences far beyond Asia. Economic growth in most of the world's 20 largest economies seems to be lower than expected in the future. New figures show that world trade fell by nearly 15 pst. in 2015. We are concerned about high public debt and currency turmoil. The central banks have used up many of the established tools. At the same time, we experience major technological changes in energy, transport and communication. Increased automation and robotization, as well as the emergence of so-called ‘big data’ and the sharing economy, will both provide high growth potential and lead to significant changes in the labour market. The sum of these changes means major requirements for migration, and that Europe is increasingly facing tougher global competition, particularly from Asia and the United States. For Norwegian industry and employment, the health status of the other European economies is crucial. More than three quarters of our exports go to the EU. Globalisation has given us new opportunities and mainly served the trade nation Norway well. It is important that we seize the new space for action, transform our economy and increase our global competitiveness in cooperation with our European partners. We strengthen the weight and relevance of foreign policy for a globalised Norwegian business. The message to Norwegian foreign stations is that cooperation with the business community has the highest priority. Europe's challenges are also Nordic challenges. A polarised debate on migration, concerns about developments in Russia and concerns about increasing terrorist threat also characterises the Nordic region. When the European construction works are under pressure, cooperation in the Nordic countries is also affected, perhaps the densest integrated region in Europe and the very core of much of our well-being. We will use Nordic cooperation and our Presidency in 2017 to strengthen Nordic adaptability. This is about economics, about strengthening green competitiveness, and about social development, where cooperation on integration is now emerging as a new area of activity. In addition to security policy discussions, I want to strengthen cooperation with my Nordic colleagues in new and demanding areas – such as migration, global security threats and the fight against terrorism and violent extremism. Developments in the north are characterised by low oil prices, increased geopolitical interest and climate change. Nevertheless, the northern regions remain a peaceful and stable region. Cooperation in the Arctic is based on common interests, balanced resource management and smart institution building. Norway is and must be in a leading role. But the stability in the north cannot be taken for granted. Russian strength building and intensification of exercises in the north demand vigilance. The military strategic balance in the north is shifting in Russia's favor. This must be met with a fixed and predictable line from the Norwegian side. That's also why the government is working to draw NATO's attention to the north. Arctic Council celebrates 20 years this year. The United States is giving high priority to its presidency. Cooperation between Member States is working well. Russia is a very important player in the Arctic. International cooperation including Russia contributes to ensuring continued stability in the region. Norway and the other coastal states of the Arctic Ocean have special rights, responsibilities and knowledge of the Arctic Ocean. We will continue to develop cooperation with them and with all the countries of the Arctic Council. We have to show that we take responsibility. The same is true of our Arctic research promise. Norway must be at the forefront of climate, marine resources, new technologies and industrial development. The government's commitment is important in order to ensure well-being and jobs in the north. We will work systematically to develop the new shipping opportunities that open up in the north. The Arctic has a great potential for future generations, but it requires that we take into account where the boundaries go for the environment. Both Norway and Europe are facing a rapidly changing world. Globalisation continues, but signs of stagnation in world trade in recent years – which I was in the process of doing – make many people ask if we are above the top. Let me, however, begin the global view with a positive perspective. Foreign policy for a globalised world is about building on the great progress in the world over the last 25 years. Let's not forget that since 1990 global value creation has doubled. World trade has grown even more rapidly. The number of people living in extreme poverty is halved, while the world's population has increased by two billion people. International assistance contributes, but the most important is effective national construction, policy reforms, resource mobilisation and good economic policies in the countries themselves. The expectations for a lasting peace agreement for the Civil War Army Colombia are great. Sri Lanka also rises after a bloody civil war and has come much further than expected in healing the wounds after the war. The democratic process in Myanmar is not yet in the finish line, but the one that just five years ago had predicted today's situation would be swept away as naively optimistic. Political progress at national level is also reflected in important progress in international cooperation in the last year. 2015 was a good and important year for the UN in many arenas. The sustainability targets adopted last year were historical. For the first time, the Member States negotiated common objectives, and for the first time, the agenda is universal. The targets also apply to Norway. We also had a breakthrough in demanding negotiations on funding for development in Addis Ababa, on the WTO agreement in Nairobi, and on the Paris climate agreement – all the processes with Norway in an active role. Important reforms in development policy at home also contribute to the achievement of sustainability objectives. As part of improving the efficiency and performance of Norwegian aid, we have reduced the number of countries that can receive Norwegian aid from 116 to 85, and we also aim to reduce the number of aid agreements by at least 30 pst. Initially, we had over 6,000 aid agreements, and that was too much. It is important to maintain and build on the positive things in the world – to anchor the belief that policies are beneficial, and to avoid stagnation and decline after 25 years with spectacular results. At the same time, we need to take a keen look at how global developments today challenge Norway and the world community. Firstly, Asia's economic growth is moving the geopolitical pendulum. Brazil’s crisis and China’s growth pain show that development is not linear, but power is still shifting east and south. We're on our way to a more fragmented and multipolar world. The United States will continue to be the world’s leading superpower for a long time and the main guarantor of Norway’s security. No country challenges the role of the United States. Nevertheless, important countries point to a distance from Europe and the United States in issues of great importance for stability, democracy and human rights. It allows for major activisation which can quickly put international cooperation under pressure. Such rivalry makes it more difficult to agree on solutions to conflicts, from Syria to the South China Sea. At the same time, the shift of economic and political centre of gravity in the world is a natural and legitimate process. That emerging powers want more influence in the world is easy to understand. The multilateral system must reflect the world anno 2016, not 1945. We are also working systematically to get closer cooperation with regional organisations. In 2015, we entered into a broader partnership with ASEAN. We have also promised our strategic partnership with the African Union. It is also in Norway’s interest to normalise bilateral relations with China. Norway is served by countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America to see the multilateral order and the UN as relevant and beneficial to them. In the Norwegian-initiated project ‘FN70: A new agenda’, we are working to promote ideas and proposals for the next UN Secretary-General. Here we work with many countries, but especially with countries in the south. Our strategic work for a place in the United Nations Security Council for 2021-2022 continues. Norway's candidacy underlines our long-term commitment to the UN as an arena for the preservation and further development of international law. The second challenge is the gradual fragmentation of global trade regimes. The preservation and strengthening of the WTO is Norway’s primary commercial policy interest. Progress in the WTO meeting in Nairobi last December was therefore good news for Norway. But a more multipolar world makes it very difficult to create pooling solutions in the WTO. Powers use increasingly commercial policy energy in regional contexts outside the WTO, arenas where Norway is often not involved. A TTIP agreement can have major consequences for Norway, including: through the EEA Agreement. We are at risk of worsening the competition conditions of Norwegian industry in our main markets. Norway must meet the challenges of intelligence and commitment. The situation is not black and white. The growth rates of the major regional agreements are good news for Norway. Regionalisation is a logical response to global complexity. But regional agreements can quickly undermine global joint solutions if we only replace national walls with regional fortresses. Where the world is not ready for genuine multilateral solutions, we need to ensure that multinational agreements build bridges across regions – that it is not geography but the desire for cooperation, growth and development through open markets that define participation in new initiatives. The third challenge is the threat posed by global pandemics. We've made impressive progress in global health. Norway has been at the forefront of the last fifteen years of extensive investment and active political and professional work. Cross-political consensus and continuity at home have strengthened Norway’s influence globally. Child mortality is almost halved, primarily due to the strong progress in the control of HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis. But it has now become clear to all of us that poor health systems in poor countries pose serious safety challenges. Not only for the billions of people living in poor parts of the world, but also for us. Ebola was a serious alarm clock. The outbreak revealed significant deficiencies in global preparedness and capacity to deal with crises. Now it's the zika virus that challenges. Norway first contributed to the World Health Organisation’s appeal to strengthen its efforts to control the virus. Global health challenges require enhanced international cooperation. Norway is leading the way in many areas, not least in terms of setting up a global framework for the financing of research and development of new vaccines against pandemics as soon as possible. There is hardly a single major safety policy analysis that is no longer paying much attention to climate change. For low-lying countries, climate noise is existing. For the rest of us, it's a threat multiplier. The Paris Agreement of December last year was important and contributes to new delivery in international climate cooperation. Norway is leading many global initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Global forest activity remains a high priority. We are taking the lead in global projects to reduce flares and methane leakages from oil and gas production. Norway is also actively participating in global efforts to phase out subsidies to fossil fuels. As an energy and natural resource nation, Norway has much to contribute to global climate change work. We have to be predictable, we have to understand the framework conditions and the space for action for Norway, we have to be in the front line of research for new technologies, and we have to create good framework conditions for environmental and climate-friendly development. The basic tone of the year's presentation is mole vote. But it is important to stress that we meet the challenges with a strong starting point. There is consensus in the Storting on the main lines of foreign and security policy. Norway is facing global turbulence with a strong economy and a society based on trust and cohesion. It is crucial when economic downturns hit key industries along our coasts and drive forward in new sectors. We're going from specialty to conversion. A reason for optimism is the robust and agreed value base on which we stand together: freedom, democracy, human rights, equality and sustainable development. These are bearable values in Norwegian society and therefore also in Norwegian foreign policy. The more it storms around us, the more important it is to hold on to who we are and the values we build on. Therefore, it is also very important that the regional and global institutions built after World War II reflect these values. International law, including the United Nations Charter, the Law of the Sea, the Conventions on Human Rights, and environmental and climate agreements, are key elements of an international framework of fundamental importance to Norway. It is now 50 years since the adoption of the two central international human rights conventions. Unfortunately, protection and promotion of human rights continue to be at least as topical. We must be a clear voice defending fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of the press. Every government's main task is to secure our country and our inhabitants – to build security and wear and tear in the face of an increasingly unpredictable environment. The current situation shows how important it is always to prioritize defence. It's too late to do this when we really need it. Strong national defence must therefore form the basis of security policy. We must give priority to the most important thing; the defence of ourselves and our obligations in NATO. We also need to address the new global security threats. In a more demanding security policy environment, it is important that we stick to our friends and alliance partners. Norway's anchoring party in security policy is our NATO membership. At the same time, there is a broad awareness in NATO of Norway's contribution to joint security in the north. Through the basic link between the Member States — that one’s security is everyone’s — NATO is the most successful military alliance in history. The forthcoming summit in July will focus more on collective defence; NATO’s core task – how NATO needs to be broadly transformed into a new situation. It is symbolic that NATO meets in exactly Warsaw – the city where the Warsaw Pact was founded over 60 years ago. Given that Europe is under increasing pressure, NATO's cooperation with the EU will become an important theme in Warsaw. Towards the summit, Norway will call for an overall approach to security. The alliance may not choose between south and east, between land forces or maritime battle forces, or between deterrence or deterrence. The security needs of all allies must be taken seriously – and all allies must contribute. This, of course, also applies to developments in our part of Europe. Developments in the North Atlantic have implications for Norway and for NATO as a whole. NATO’s attention has recently been drawn to the north through allied exercises and training activities. This is important. The government will work towards the NATO Summit to strengthen NATO's maritime strategy, with great emphasis on the northern seas. In relations with Russia, clarity must be combined with actions from NATO to avoid dangerous incidents and increased tension. Here's Norway's a proponent. The most joyful thing about last year's disarmament front was the nuclear agreement with Iran. An important premise for the conclusion of the agreement was that Iran's lava-rich uranium was replaced by natural uranium. When we received a request from the United States to contribute, we saw it as a natural continuation of our work on disarmament and to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. We provided technical expertise and contributed financially to the implementation of a central part of the nuclear agreement. Experts from the State Radiation Protection System verified and controlled the transport. The Norwegian contribution was important because it contributed to the implementation of the nuclear agreement earlier than would otherwise be the case. For several years, we have worked closely with the United Kingdom to verify disarmament. The work provides an important basis for future cuts in nuclear arsenals. Norway also has a leading position in the international cooperation on nuclear safety that President Obama in due course took the initiative. The Prime Minister will attend Obama's nuclear safety summit in Washington later this month. The government is systematically working to achieve the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. Here we work concretely, long-term and along several tracks. The refugee crisis has increased the attention of the government to what we refer to as vulnerable states, in a broad belt of land from Mali in the west via the Horn of Africa and the Middle East to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east. The development of these regions threatens European and Norwegian security. This requires action – courageous and innovative policy initiatives. It requires that we see all the instruments we have, in the context of diplomacy, security, military contributions, development and job creation, humanitarian efforts, the promotion of human rights and the assistance to build well-functioning institutions. Today’s challenges demand that we rethink development policies to reach the most vulnerable countries and to avoid the collapse of vulnerable countries — not at the expense of the poorest, but because this is the most effective way to reach the most vulnerable among the poor. Six out of 12 focus countries are vulnerable countries. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has therefore now embarked on a separate strategy to collect efforts against vulnerable countries. Experience from Afghanistan to South Sudan shows that there are no plans for successful state-building in vulnerable countries. We must not believe that as outsiders we can create stable and peaceful societies. Everything we do needs to be anchored in national forces with the ability to control. The interaction between humanitarian and long-term aid needs to be strengthened. We need the economic muscles of developing banks. The United Nations has a particularly important role and Norway will continue to support a strengthened UN in vulnerable countries. Norwegian voluntary organisations are also key actors. Recent reviews of UN peace and security efforts underline that we need to improve conflict prevention and that women need to be involved. Norway is moving ahead to ensure that both men’s and women’s experiences and perspectives are taken seriously. Then the conflict analyses become real, and we ensure access to the breadth of possible solutions. – And in this work we must not forget the human rights: without fundamental rights – no stability over time. Work on stabilisation and development in vulnerable countries means higher risks than we experience in more stable developing countries. There is a greater risk of corruption and of projects failing. But we have to take the risk, because the risk of not doing anything is even greater. The Norwegian Peace and Reconciliation Policy is a priority area of policy which, with the new strategy, is given a fresh impetus – and an even stronger reason. At the same time, large resources will continue to be used to combat poverty and prevent conflict in other parts of Africa and Asia. The ambitious efforts in education, health, economic development and job creation continue and are highlighted. This is important in order to achieve the poorest and to achieve the UN's new sustainability targets. We must prevent poor countries that are currently stable and experience democratic development and economic growth from falling back into negative spirals of violence and conflict. Securing Norway and defending a multilateral order is not least about the ability of good diplomatic craftsmanship. Norway has a long tradition of making contributions – not only in terms of money but also competence – into important global processes, such as international maritime law, peace and reconciliation, humanitarian aid or efforts to create good international standards, such as climate negotiations. Norwegian foreign service and other Norwegian professional environments are often called on because we are known to be able to deliver. This competence is structured over time and contributes to making Norwegian foreign policy relevant and requested. I would like to conclude this year's presentation by pointing out ten specific areas in which Norway takes special responsibility: We're a solid alliance partner. The United States is Norway's most important allies. NATO is our security anchor. Our allies know they can trust Norway. We maintain our stable relationship with Russia. We continue to be a consistent and predictable neighbour of Russia. We sharpen the analytical tools and strengthen our Russian competence. We give priority to the northern regions. Our goal is that the northern regions remain a region characterised by cooperation and responsible resource management. We contribute heavily in Europe. Europe's challenges are our challenges. We contribute to everything from energy security through migration solutions and strategic use of EEA funds. We're preparing Norway for a world with increased economic focus in Asia. Continued well-being requires that we seize new opportunities and build relationships in emerging economies in the south and east. We are increasing the already extensive humanitarian aid and rates in vulnerable states. Never in recent times have humanitarian needs been greater. However, Norway has never contributed more. We are reforming and concentrating development policy. The number of beneficiary countries and aid agreements is reduced and the evaluation and performance requirements are strengthened. We continue the large-scale investment in education. Through the educational initiative, Norway has taken a global leadership to ensure education for all. We are further developing our active peace and reconciliation policy. Preventing conflict and war and contributing to the resolution of acute conflicts are cost-effective foreign policy. We continue to show way in international climate work. Norway was a driving force in getting the Paris Agreement in place, and now work on implementing it is under way. The primary objective of foreign policy is to safeguard and promote Norwegian interests – our values, our security, our well-being. The seriousness, the unrest and the unforeseeableness that I have explained today require clear thinking and wise action to promote Norwegian interests, invest in the values and the global framework to ensure that the right thing is ahead of power.""]","<|system|>

It is therefore justified that, in the search for the truth, the PS assessment of the risks in the presence, the successes achieved and, in the same way, the work and the ambitions to be carried out should be recorded here. We will not lose ourselves at proper expense, as we are not disturbed by the noise of opposition that another project does not have to be that of denial. [[P.S.'s applause.]] It must be said that not all we did was all we had to do and not all we did was done well. But we do not miss the truth to the Portuguese, nor do we break with the recommended humility if we say that we have done so much and that we have done so much well. [[P.S.'s applause.]] To this end, the Government and the PS have supported and encouraged their parliamentary partners, who have ensured the investment of the government and the implementation of measures resulting from budgetary laws. We count on your support to leave where we left and to get where we arrived. This means that we share our successes with them in the same way that we share our difficulties. We will certainly continue this work, strengthening and reinventing, as we have done, a convergence that has never harmed and that will never harm the identity and autonomy of each of the political forces involved in this so innovative and rewarding cooperation has been for our country and for the Portuguese. [[P.S.'s applause.]] We know that the successes we have achieved should not deviate from the need to respond more readily to the remaining concerns and difficulties. We know that the challenges continue to be many, in a country still subject to significant financial constraints and an external framework that is not free from risks and threats. In fact, according to the projections made yesterday by the European Commission, this year Portugal will have a growth of its economy higher than that of the European Union as a whole, or that of the euro area, which means that we will be converging with Europe for the second consecutive year and at the end of 17 years. [[P.S.'s applause.]] But we must not, nor can we, ignore signs that represent risks for us, since they can result from the rising geopolitical tensions and disunity in Europe, the slowing down of European economies, the evolution in other economic powers, the recovery of other tourist destination markets or changes in global trade policy that affect countries destined for our exports. We would like that of the euphemistically called 'adjustment period' had not resulted in an even more indebted country, at the same time as less resistant and socially and economically impoverished. The PSD/CDS Government was the only one in our democratic history that left the following government a gross domestic product inferior to the one it received. We would also like to see the budgetary targets now under our European commitments allowing for a smoother path in reducing deficit and debt or other solutions to be changed. But it is also true that, at the external level, the way in which the Government is certifying the quality of our management, increases confidence with our partners and prestigious, at the international level, the governance project of the Portuguese left. [[P.S.'s applause.]] With the previous government, policy gave priority to budgetary compression, by limiting the economy and, without sensitivity, public services and social benefits. With the current government we confirmed that there was an alternative: we preferred economic dynamisation and social protection, without neglecting budgetary consolidation. The results of these almost three years show that we follow in the most advised direction: we do not repeat the persecution austerity of the right, nor did we embrace impossible tasks that compromised the credibility of the left. With this change, Portugal is better and the lives of Portuguese as well. [[P.S.'s applause.]] Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Members: If it is our obligation to prepare the country for all the contingencies, it is also up to us to take account of the many positive aspects acquired, recognizing that, in many cases, we are still short of what the ambition of a left-backed government demands. For example, we received a National Health Service in capacity loss, but we are already, as we have already pointed out today, to reverse the degradation that was observed with better responses, with more health professionals, with more investment, and now with less accumulated deficit, less late payments and less debt. We know, however, that recovery needs to be faster and that efficiency needs to be more widespread. The results in education also give us good news. For example, the number of young people who do not study or work is at the lowest level ever. School dropout was significantly reduced, and the tendency to reduce school failure was also reversed. But we do not satisfy ourselves, knowing that the fight against the shortage of qualifications is a task that is mixed with the most structural deficits in our country. We are also able to achieve the best position of the last 14 years in the world ranking of competitiveness already published this year. And investors note this perception: the foreign investment stock has grown more than EUR 8 billion since 2015. In 2017, Portugal also became the best position ever in the European innovation ranking. However, although we are above the European average in indicators such as the penetration of broadband in companies or in the production of new doctors on the 14th. the place we still occupy shows that we have to improve. After the public investment has risen three percentage points of GDP in 2017, this year will rise four more points, placing itself above the level of Ireland and Italy. Even so, it will continue below the euro area average, which has been happening since 2012. The effort will therefore have to continue. When this government took over, the turnover of the various sectors fell, consumer confidence was at least the year and economic climate at least the last nine months. That was the state of the nation! With the current government, consumer confidence is at a maximum of 21 years and the economic climate in the best value of the last 16. The economy has already grown 5, 4 %, private consumption 5, 9 %, investment 14, 5 % and exports 14, 7 %. This is the state that makes the difference! These are the results that tell us we are on the right track! [[P.S.'s applause.]] This is the truth that destroys the accuser and deputized lady who here made the parliamentary leaders of the PSD and the CDS-PP. Ladies and gentlemen. Members, national minimum wage and pensions continue to increase, such as social benefits, particularly those aimed at combating child poverty. The available income of families has already increased by 8 %, values which are strongly opposed to the breakdown of 5 % recorded during the previous fiscal year. Over the past two years, we have made nearly 400 000 people no longer at risk of poverty and severe material deprivation. But there are still many who remain at this risk and who call our attention in a country still with many inequalities. Portugal has been the country of the euro area which has greatly reduced unemployment since January 2016. There are fewer than 34,000 unemployed young people than there was in the late government of Mr. Fernando Negrão. [[P.S.'s applause.]] But there are still many unemployed young people and there are, as the PS has said, many young people who remain vulnerable, who go through various jobs always under temporary conditions, delaying dreams, decisions and commitments, since buying a home to uncertainty about having or not having a child. That is why and for that, it is important to review the labour legislation that is now pending in the Assembly of the Republic. [[P.S.'s applause.]] Ladies and gentlemen. Members, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen. Members of the Government: We do not lack reasons to be proud of what we have done and to mobilize ourselves for what we need to do. The PS will never miss the Portuguese people, because, if you miss, you will lack certain agenda and a left-wing government in our country. To think beyond today is our obligation, our agenda — a agenda far from being exhausted! This is an agenda of reformist policies that improve the efficiency and stability of social protection regimes, from public health to education, social security, transport or housing. It is an agenda of reformist policies, the planning of the territory to environmental sustainability, the organization and guarantees of work to economic competitiveness, innovation policies to science and technological incorporation, culture, public administration qualification, the enhancement of our natural resources from forest to sea. For all this it is important to continue to mobilize progressive energies and, as the PS defends, a prestigious and strong state, which guarantees internal security and justice close to citizens, a modern, agile, effective, intelligent and strategically entrepreneurial state, which stimulates civic participation and contributes to social and territorial cohesion. This is our commitment: overcome the difficulties, continue the successes, continue the way and take care of the future. It is to make Portuguese left one of the reasons for winning Portugal. [[PS applause, stand up.]]"", 'Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Members: on the day immediately following the exit of Portugal from the Excessive Challenge Procedure, the Portuguese were suddenly shaken with the greatest human catastrophe in recent decades. In less than 24 hours, we passed from relief to constancy, from satisfaction to revolt, showing how, before the primacy of human life, everything else has relative value. None of us will ever forget that day, and we have the duty to do everything to keep up with the memory of those who have died, the pain of their family members and friends, the terror of the people threatened by the flames, the courage and the brightness of those who have fought the fire, those who have managed the rescue, the technicians who investigate the event, the gratitude due to the prompt international aid, the current of solidarity that has traveled throughout society, showing once again the extraordinary capacity of the Portuguese to join and mobilize to overcome adversity. What is required of us today is very clear: two immediate tasks and facing a structural challenge. First, rebuild what was destroyed and restore the productive capacity of the affected territories. The government is working very hard in collaboration with local authorities, and today the low and medium-voltage lines are being re-established, the communication fiber cables and the first three housings have begun to be rebuilt. Secondly, to clarify fully what has happened and, depending on the facts, to establish responsibilities, whatever their nature, because we all have the right to know and we all have a duty of complete transparency before the citizens. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] I would like to reaffirm here that, without prejudice to the information and evaluation that the public bodies have produced or are concluding or from the scientific studies you have requested, the Government will give all the collaboration and support to the criminal investigation opened by the Public Prosecutor\'s Office and the independent technical committee constituted by a proposal from the main opposition party in this House. But, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, what is essential, which is structural in order to avoid new disasters, is to face the challenge of revitalizing the interior and reordinating the forest. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] If there are answers that we still do not have, because the investigations are still under way, there are solutions that we know that the country has long waited and cannot continue to wait. That is why the Government created the Mission Unit for the Valorization of the Interior in March 2016 and that is why, in October last year, it launched the forest reform, which has been under discussion since April in this House. We cannot continue to regret that the great problem is the abandonment of forests and not the adoption of the instruments of mobilisation of land for abandonment. We cannot continue to justify that the micro-forest mini-funding does not generate sufficient income and we do not create the associative, private or public structures that allow the necessary economic recovery of the forest. We cannot continue to say that the problem is that we do not know the owners of millions of hectares and do not approve mechanisms that finally speed up the completion of the register. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] We cannot continue to demand the end of the eucalyptus monoculture and not stop the expansion of its planting area. We all know this, and even this, that it is necessary to do and we cannot continue to delay because we fear the economic impact on the paper industry or because we are afraid of the inevitable popular revolts against the demarcation of property. Is it difficult, it takes time and only in the long run produces results? Yeah. Three times yes! It\'s hard, it takes time and only in time it produces results but much more difficult is to let go and much more time we\'ll lose if we start later. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] I therefore once again call on the joint effort to consensualize this structural reform for the future of the country. And the best way to say ""never again"" is to launch in these seven municipalities martyred by the fires of Pedrogão and Góis a pilot project of the policies of revitalization of the territory and forest reorganisation. Thus, and for this purpose, we will relocate to Pedrogon the Mission Unit for the Valorization of the Interior, so that you can directly execute it on the ground. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Members: This debate on the state of the nation is also a moment of general balance and anticipation of the country\'s future. There are five indicators that mark the last year. First and foremost, the priority of our economic policy, employment. More than 175 000 new jobs have been created since the beginning of 2016 and the unemployment rate has declined to 9, 5 % in the context of an increase in the active population. Secondly, the decisive creation of confidence in economic actors. Consumer confidence is in the highest value ever and the economic climate has reached the maximum of the last 15 years. Third, the investment. In volume, investment in the first quarter of 2017 has had the largest growth in counterparts in the last 18 years and advanced indicators show the maintenance, or even acceleration, of current growth levels. Fourthly, the growth of the economy sustained in employment, investment and confidence. After the recovery in 2016, GDP has reached the highest growth in the first quarter of this year since the beginning of the century, finally recommencing convergence with the euro zone. Fifth, for the first time in the last 10 years, the country has met the budgetary targets, registering the lowest deficit in our democracy and ensuring the exit of the excessive deficit procedure. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] Yes, there was a real choice! And the government and the majority have complied with the alternative they have committed themselves to. The good results we have achieved are not the result of one chance; they are the good results that emerge from the good policies that we have been able to adopt. After all, we did not need to continue to impoverish or destroy labour rights so that the export of marketable goods had, in May, a similar growth of 15 to 4 %. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] After all, we did not need to increase the tax burden or cut pensions and social support to consolidate our public finances. on the contrary, it was the new income policy and predictability of the decrease in the tax burden that generated confidence and was the incentive to invest and qualify workers who improved our competitiveness. This is the way we must continue to have more growth, better employment, more equality: investing in knowledge, innovation and dignity at work. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen. It is also true that we are still far from the levels of growth, employment and equality that we aim for Portugal and for Portuguese. Progress is a goal that requires persistence and requires sustained and sustainable policies. A strong state, which guarantees national defence, internal security, and justice close to citizens, but at the same time a modern, agile, effective, intelligent and strategically enterprising state. A State that guarantees access to all public services of quality, that combats inequalities, that stimulates civic participation and that contributes to social and territorial cohesion, from the outset, strengthening investment in health and education as the fundamental rights of citizens. at the stage of the debate, Minister Adalberto Campos Fernandes will have the opportunity to present what we are and will continue to do to ensure a National Health Service that responds more and more to the needs and expectations of citizens. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] in education, we will deepen the strategy to combat the deficit of qualifications — the real structural deficit of the country — by promoting the success of the new generations and opening up new opportunities for the old generations. next school year, we will have two new important contributions to promoting school success. On the one hand, benefiting from the new evaluation model, we will have greater pedagogical autonomy in flexible curriculum management and, on the other hand, the reduction of the number of students per class in schools in priority educational intervention territories. There will be two excellent contributions to improve education success policy. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] Housing must be a new priority area in public policies, now addressed to the middle classes and especially to new generations, not condemning them to indebtedness or abandonment of the city centre, promoting, before, the offer of housing for affordable rent. in the government adjustment that I will present to Mr President of the Republic tomorrow, precisely the empowerment of housing as Secretary of State is envisaged. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] But the State\'s strategic intervention capacity can only be improved if we strengthen and modernize the Public Administration, promote innovation in the public sector and value the exercise of public functions. We will therefore continue to engage in the Simplex+ Programme, seeking to simplify more and more people\'s day-to-days and reduce the cost of context for businesses, and we will put into operation the Competition Centres, which, through the concentration of qualified skills in specialized fields, will allow to reduce external recruitment and strengthen knowledge and know-how within the Public Administration. The value of public service work will also continue to be a priority, as provided for in the Government Programme, and as planned in 2018 we will start the process of defrosting careers. For real social and territorial cohesion it is still essential to put the process of decentralization in place, and there is a lot to discuss in this House of the Republic. The example of public transport is very impressive. After years and years of losing passengers, under the management of the State, STCP (Sociedad de Transportes Coletivos do Porto, SA) has already recovered this year, 7% of passengers and the new Caris fares allowed more than 470 000 travel/month to users over 65 years and more than 100 000 trips/month for children up to 10 years. for the first time in 17 years, Carris opened two new careers yesterday, going to open three more by the end of this month, and even today the administration of STCPs awarded the acquisition of 173 new buses, moreover, produced by the national industry. [[P.S.\'s applause.]] This is also the example that we can replicate if we release from centralism the areas in which, as the experience has shown, we can and should rely on the municipalities and the parish, which can do more and better than what the central state can do. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Members, we need to think beyond the current legislature and design for the decade a medium-term vision that simultaneously reinforces external competitiveness and internal cohesion as a basis for continued and sustained convergence with the European Union. There is more life beyond this legislature and the need to prepare Portugal after-2020 imposes the opportunity of this debate. We started on 19 June, at the Territorial Concertation Council, the evaluation, with the autonomous regions, local authorities and metropolitan areas, of the general lines of the priorities of the post-2020 programme, which we will extend to the Economic and Social Council and which will promote in this House the reopening of parliamentary work. The matrix in which we work is based on two horizontal axes and four territorial axes. Two horizontal axes: innovation and knowledge; qualification, training and employment. Four territorial axes: energy and climate change; sea economy; integration into global networks and markets; internality and the Iberian market. It is a matrix based on a clear development model: to be more coherent internally, to be more competitive in the global economy and thus strengthen a decade of convergence with the European Union. In short: three C — competitiveness and cohesion for convergence. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Members, we are here, in this debate of the state of the Nation, responding to the emergency, persisting in the successful realization of the political change that marks this legislature and with a strategic vision for a decade of convergence, which, together, we and we want to continue to build. [[PS applause, stand up.]]', 'Mr. President of the Assembly of the Republic, Mr. Professor Aníbal Cavaco Silva, Illustres High Foreign dignitaries present here, Prime Minister and government members, Mr. Presidents of the Supreme Court, Mr. Former Presidents of the Republic and of the Assembly of the Republic, ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Guests, Portuguese: Portugal is the reason for being the solemn commitment I have just made. Here I was born, here I learned with my parents speaking the language that unites us and joins hundreds of millions all over the world. Here I brought up my children and I hope to see my grandchildren grow up. Here they have been created, and will always live with me, those feelings that we do not know to define, but that bind us to all the Portuguese. Love of the earth, longing, sweetness in speaking, communion in vibrating, generosity in inclusion, belief in miracles of Ourique, heroism in decisive moments. It is for Portugal, for every Portuguese and for every Portuguese that goes my first and decisive thought made of memory, of loyalty, of affection, of fidelity to a common destiny. Mr. President of the Assembly of the Republic, Dr. Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues, in the person of Your Excellency, I welcome the legitimate and plural representation of the popular will expressed in the Assembly of the Republic and guarantee the undefectable institutional solidarity between the only two sovereign bodies founded on the universal and direct vote of all the people we are. Mr. Professor Aníbal Cavaco Silva, as he goes through, in an imperative exercise of memory, the long and singular career of service to the homeland of Your Excellency—with a decade in the head of government and a decade in the head of the state, which largely defined the Portugal we have—I understand to be strict duty of justice, regardless of the judgments that all political experience raises, to direct to Your Excellency a word of gratitude for the commitment he has always put in the defense of the national interest, of the view that was correct to him, sacrificing personal, academic and professional life in an unforgettable dedication to the common good. Well, there you go! [[PSD applause, standing members, CDS-PP and PS Members.]] Mr. General António Ramalho Eanes and Dr. Jorge Sampaio, the presence of Your Excellency is the symbol of the continuity and wealth of our Democracy, a remarkable lineage in which Mr. Dr. Mário Soares is also included. Democracy that is haunted by the presence of three illustrious foreign guests who honor us, by accepting the personal invitations I have made, corresponding to the essential coordinates of our foreign policy. of national origin, converted into European neighbourhood, brotherhood and complicity, in the person of His Majesty King Philip VI. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] of the desire to build a new future based on an eloquent and warm fraternity, and community of destiny, in the person of His Excellency President Filipe Nyusi. [[PSD, PS, CDS-PP and Os Verdes applause.]] of our constant commitment to a united and solidarity Europe, in the person of His Excellency President Jean-Claude Juncker. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] It adds to this dimension of State another, personal, in which respect joins, old ties and grateful friendship. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. Members : He wrote a 19th-century Portuguese hero that «this Kingdom is the work of soldiers». Thus, since the foundation of Portugal, it has been attested in Zamora and recognized urbi et orrbi by the Boula Manifestis Probatum est, in the battles of continental expansion or defense and restoration of independence, as in the maritime epics or today in the missions of peace, or humanitarians, within and outside Europe with our always faithful Armed Forces in Portugal. So it was also, on 25 April 1974, with the young captains, redeeming freedom, announcing democracy, allowing the colonial empire to become a community of independent peoples and states, promising peace, development and justice for all. [[PSD, PS, BE and CDS-PP applause.]] As many — military and civil — have always done Portugal, as in particular to those, civilians and military, have built the democratic Republic here, we must be elected by the people in compliance with the Constitution. I\'m saying, the Constitution. in this same Hemicycle, discussed and approved in the middle of a revolution and promulgated, almost 40 years ago, on 2 April 1976. I remember, with emotion, these unforgettable times, in which, young constituent, I joined my voice and my vote to so many more, coming from such diverse quadrants, having gone along such varied paths, having added years or even decades of struggle, to the fight of the moment so that the constitution that rules us could be born and that was reviewed and cherished for new eras. For this reason, the Basic Law continues to be our common denominator: everyone, at some point, contributed to at least a part of its content. Defend it, fulfill it and do it is the duty of the President of the Republic. And it would always be, even if you voted on it, to have followed some of its main revisions and to have taught it over 40 years, they would not be more responsible for those who have just taken office before you. The President of the Republic will therefore be a permanent and scrupulous guardian of the Constitution and its values, which, after all, are the values of the nation that we are proud to be. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] The value of respect for the dignity of the human person, first of all, of people of flesh and bone, who have the right to be free, but who have the same right to a society in which there are not, dramatically persistently, two million poor, more than half a million at risk of poverty, and still shocking differences between groups, regions and social classes. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] Safeguarding life, physical and spiritual integrity, freedom of thought, belief, expression and pluralism of opinion and organization is a duty of all of us. As it is to fight for more social justice, which implies effective creation of wealth, but does not satisfy itself with contemplation of numbers and wants to reach people and their rights and duties. The matrix values of the Constitution are, in the same way, those of the national identity, made of roots on our land and sea, but of universal vocation, a platform that we constitute between continents and, above all, between cultures and civilizations. Roots in this land and in this sea, which form a true archipelago with three vertices — continent, Azores and Madeira — and covers the ocean that made us and makes us great. We can and must continue to take the sea as a national priority, a priority dear to your Excellency. Professor Aníbal Cavaco Silva. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] Priority born of a geostrategy and, above all, a universal vocation—as António Lobo Antunes wrote: «If my land is small, I want to die in the sea». Universal vocation of a nation divided by the five continents, in which more than half of us, between nationals and descendants, live to create ""Portuguese"" outside our physical territory, but within our spiritual territory. Universal vocation, in the embrace that binds us to the fraternal peoples, who share our language, in an open and inclusive community. Universal vocation, in which history joins the geography and in which we are Europeans, at the point of departure and in the firm will to participate in European unity, is enriched with transatlantic beings and, more than that, we can approach the most distinct nations and words and economies and societies, without xenophobia, without intolerance, without complexes of false superiority or incomprehensible inferiority. In short, national identity made of soil and blood, of bet on language, education, science, culture, the ability to know how to combine the future with the past, without fear of facing the present. An identity lived in a state of democratic, representative law, but also participatory and referendum, plural and fraternal, respecting the popular sovereignty, the separation and conjugation of powers, the independence of justice, the political and legislative autonomy of the Azores and Madeira and the administrative autonomy of the local power. Jealous in the protection of personal and political freedoms, but bet on asserting economic, social and cultural rights. And, therefore, the social rule of law in which the creativity of the private initiative is combined with the relevant social sector and always bear in mind that the economic power must be subordinated to the political power and not that it serves as an instrument of that. In other words, democratic political power should not prevent the dynamism and pluralism of a civil society — traditionally so weak among us — in its excesses, but it cannot resign itself from its defining role of rules, rector of injustices, even greater levels of economic, social and cultural well-being, in particular, for those who the invisible hand has erased, sub-alternized or marginalized. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] It is within the framework of this Constitution—that, like all human work, it is not untouchable, but that it requires broad consensus to be restored, that one, rather than divide—which we have in the front, times and challenges difficult to overcome. We must be able to combine the struggle, at the universal level, with the same values that govern us — the dignity of the person, peace, justice, freedom, development, intergenerational equity or appreciation of the environment — with the defence of reform of institutions that become notoriously inadequate or inadequate. We must be faithful to our sovereign commitments — especially those that correspond to the permanent coordinates of our foreign policy, such as the European Union, the CPLP and the Atlantic Alliance — and never lose sight that, as well as them, there are signs of calling for reflections of substance, in a form or in a spirit of solidarity, in a very different context from those who have witnessed their most significant changes. The challenges of refugees in Europe, of non-economic and financial discrimination in the CPLP and the Atlantic Alliance borders are just three examples, among many, of pressing issues, even if they are uncomfortable. We have to get out of the climate of crisis, in which we have almost always lived since the beginning of the century, affirming our own love, our wisdom, endurance, experience, the notion of fundamental. We must go further, with realism but vision of the future, in the capacity and quality of our education and science, but also of demography, health, social security, justice and public administration and the political system itself, and their constant moralization and credibility, in particular by combating corruption, customerism and nepotism. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] We must not forget, therefore, between us and Europe to which we belong, that, without rigor and financial transparency, the risk of returning or perpetuating crises is painfully greater, but also that unaccompanied healthy finances of growth and employment can mean impoverishment and aggravated injustices and social conflicts. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] We must heal wounds of these so long years of sacrifice, in the weakening of the social fabric, in the loss of regime consensus, in the division between political hemispheres. Everything undesirable, precisely in years when it is urgent to re-create convergences, rediscover dialogues, redeploy understandings, rebuild reasons for hope. We must strengthen the sense of belonging to a country, which is the same for all and before which there is only — or must be — Portuguese of equal dignity and status. Are the challenges difficult, complex, surrounded by incognito the challenges evoked? Are they forced to work reinforced in the face of an uncertain world, a Europe with new tensions in internal and external solidarity, public finances not to entail fears, financial system that prevents it from remedying and that it does not create ostracisms or dependencies contrary to national interest, policy to test new formulas, demand for clearer, faster and more equitable responses? No doubt. After the transition from the revolution to constitutionalism, the stabilization of party democracy, European accession and the adoption of the euro, the high expectations of the turn of the century and some frustrations, however, experienced, as well as the self-sufficient response of the Portuguese, await us five years of search for unity, peace, strengthened national cohesion, complex meeting between democracy and strategic internationalization, within and outside borders, and between growth, employment and social justice, on the one hand, and financial viability, on the other hand, of creating consonances in social and political systems, of unceasing building a friendly and solidarity community. Never losing faith in Portugal and in our secular ability to overcome crises. I never believe in democracy. Never letting hope die. Never forgetting that what unites us is much more important and lasting than what divides us. Persisting when the temptation is to give up. Making incomprehensions in redoubled mood. By preferring the small gestures that approach the great proclamations that go away. Honestly. With patience. With perseverance. With temperance. With courage. With humility. The fifth President of the Republic who is freely elected in democracy and who welcomes the candidates, here present, who have fought the elections of 24 January. [[PSD, PS, BE and CDS-PP applause.]] And because, freely elected by popular vote, President of all without exception. A President who is neither in favour nor against anyone. This will be politically, from the beginning to the end of its term of office. But socially, in favour of the young person who wants to exercise his qualifications and, ultimately, seeks employment. the woman who hopes to see her role more recognized in a world still so unequal. the pensioner or retired who dreamed, 30 or 40 years ago, of a 25 April that does not correspond to his current horizon of life. from the scientist looking for incentives always postponed. the farmer, the trader, the industrial, who, day by day, survives the world of obstacles surrounding it. the worker on behalf of another or independent person, who pays the taxes that are very supportive of the systems that legitimately protect those who suffer most in our social state. of the new and bold talent that is changing our society and our economy. of the IPSS, of mercy, of the institution closest to the people—in the Autonomous Regions and in the authorities—that takes care of many, of whom no one else can take better care of. of which, in the still distant interior, in the islands, sometimes forgotten, in the communities that inhabit the world, is permanently a portrait of our tenacity as a Nation. Of all these and many more, the President of the Republic is the President of all. Without easy promises, or programs you know cannot fulfill, but with constant determination, assuming, in full, its powers and duties. Without wanting to be more than the Constitution allows, without accepting to be less than the Constitution imposes. [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause.]] A public prosecutor\'s servant. That the same is to say, a servant of this country of almost nine centuries. The country that asks us at every step, demanding much more and much better. But the answer comes from one of our biggest, Miguel Torga, who wrote in 1987, goes to 30 years: « The difficult thing for every Portuguese is not to be; it is to understand. We never knew how to look cold in the mirror of life. Passion takes away our sight. from there the kind of obscure innocence with which we act in history. Power and worth, we are not always aware of what we can and are worth. We provincially hypertrophy the abilities of others and severely minimize our abilities, without even remembering that a creature does not lend only when it ceases to be restless. And we are the very incarnate concern. It was she who made us transcend all the space limits and know all the human longitudes(... ) We are not a dead people, not even exhausted. We also have a great role to play within the nations, like the most ecumenical of all. The world today does not need our insufficient technique, our precarious industry or our scarce raw materials. It needs our culture and our vocation to embrace it cordially, as if it were the natural heritage of all men. Do not keep on seeking. ” This portrait of Miguel Torga can sound very far, when they multiply today, in science, technique, in the creation of wealth, so many examples of Portuguese invention, between us or on the edge of the universe. And yet Torga saw the essential. The essential thing is that we continue to minimize what we value and, however, we are worth much more than we sometimes think or say. The essential thing is that our genius—which distinguishes us from others—is the indomitable creative concern that presides over our ecumenical vocation, embracing the whole world. She did us the way we are. Big ones in the past. Big in the future. So here we are. So here I am. For Portugal of all time! [[PSD, PS and CDS-PP applause, stand up.]]']","<|system|>

37,235,37_energy_lignite_electricity_gas,"['energy', 'lignite', 'electricity', 'gas', 'syriza', 'transition', 'development', 'environmental', 'macedonia', 'plan']","['energy', 'lignite', 'electricity', 'gas', 'syriza', 'transition', 'development', 'environmental', 'macedonia', 'plan']","[""Ladies and gentlemen, the starting point for a new development and productive effort in our country cannot but be the development of a new energy policy. Our strategic goal is to create an economic and environmentally sustainable long-term energy plan and to adopt a new structure and a new energy market model, with households as a priority, support for small and large enterprises by ensuring competitive energy costs and promoting energy investments with a multiplier impact on the economy. The development of a new energy policy, which takes serious account of international trends and developments and the specificities of the Greek economy and society. It is a direct priority, but also a prerequisite for the relaunching of our economy. In this context, we will take every opportunity to include in this strategy the relevant commitments and reforms included in the last agreement with their proper implementation in Greek reality and, where necessary, the finding of alternatives and options. We will insist on this, because any liberalisation of the market on the basis of the European markets will not have a real advantage unless it ensures investment for security of supply unless it provides better services and in particular cheaper electricity costs for citizens and the economy. The crisis of the previous development model, which also led to the debt crisis, has eroded in the five years of the memorandum, leading to a reduction in consumption and energy demand. In this climate privatization policies have been developed, focusing on PPC and the electricity transmission network. The previous political system, based on self-contained commitments and dependencies, was unable to approach modern technological developments, process and implement a modern, long-term energy design. Thus, the uncontrolled and market development of the electricity production infrastructure has formed a falsified domestic energy market. Many mechanisms for compensation, aid and ultimately guaranteed profits were activated for a private-sector private sector of production and disposal in the energy market. The strengthening of the share of gas in the energy mix, instead of channelling direct combustion, industry and households, was used in the production of electricity in the gas plants of private producers, by charging energy costs, with the corresponding social consequences. At the same time, the way in which renewable energy sources have developed, which have been another major growth - in introductory terms - have turned them into a burden factor for the general energy costs and private market manipulation. The country, therefore, remains in conditions of a contradictory, uncertain energy landscape to date, remains in an unstable and changing energy fuel mix, without any design at all. The adjustment of the domestic energy system to European data has not been possible until now, under the responsibility of the old political system. Any harmonisation of the domestic market in European standards, as defined by the European policy of the third package and the Target model, remains under the hostage of private interests and state-owned entrepreneurship. The government's strategic objective in the energy sector is a new democratic energy model, with priorities for social and environmental needs at local, regional and national level. This heading prejudges the gradual decommissioning of fossil fuels, the increase in active efficiency, the socially-oriented design of increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources. During the previous government, our own government, despite the great difficulties, despite the lack of liquidity, the overcompensation of the energy market, measures were taken to address deficits and debts from domestic consumers and businesses were settled. They were refuelled with electricity, hundreds of thousands of our destitute citizens. Genuine debt arrangements were granted by PPC’s new administration. The increases in electricity tariffs, which had been promoted in secret by the outgoing coexistence, have been canceled. In cooperation with the PPA, gas prices decreased significantly by at least 16%. Increases in regulated network tariffs have frozen. Mostly through a tough negotiation in the last month, during the debate on the last agreement, following a great preparation, the immediate privatisation of IPTO was disproved. Thus, the government's proposal was recorded in the agreement in the search for an alternative. This debate is under way and we believe that it will eventually be reflected in a law that safeguards the public character of PPC and will not privatise IPTO in the near future. The explicit timetable for the separation and privatisation of small PPC, which the lenders and domestic interests have persistently restored, which the Government of New Democracy and PASOK had implemented, was out of discussion and cancelled. The design and implementation of the various mechanisms that regulate the production and supply of electricity, on the basis of the general European Union's energy policies, remain open to negotiating and demanding fields to ensure energy as a social asset and development by means of decisive public control of the organisation and management of the whole system. Ladies and gentlemen, the international energy environment is not exhausted within the limits of the European Union. On the basis of the country's particular geopolitical position, a coherent and long-term plan of strategy is required, aimed at the country's energy sovereignty with pluralism of energy sources, cooperation and corporate alliances. The government proposal aims to make use of the country's position in the international energy field as an investment basis. For the overall organisation of the energy field, it is necessary to develop and implement a national strategy, in line with the general policies of the European Union, but mainly adapted to the economic, social, productive and geophysical specificities of our country. To this end, we will recommend a National Energy Council, in which all sector actors and all categories of consumers will be invited to participate. The renewable energy sector is strategically important for our country. It is a factor that is in line with the general European policy. The development of the indigenous potential of RES contributes to the formation of the national energy mix, energy security of the country and its participation in climate protection. The formation of a pluralist, in the forms of the social, public energy-generating sector with the core of PPC, protected from privatization practices, is recommended. In the production ceilings provided for in the agreement, in order to create an artificial space for private individuals, we must design those institutional financial conditions for the establishment of viable corporate schemes on a cooperative basis, associated, for example, with the energy autonomy of selected islands, the technology of renewable energy sources or hybrid systems, including forms of partnerships and even genuine private investment in self-production of industrial plants and structures. In this way they can mitigate the impact of the competition rated. A decisive factor in our energy policy and strategy is energy savings and a radical change in the current energy balance. Public preparation of an investment programme in energy saving will help reduce energy costs, protect the environment, improve the quality of life of citizens, create thousands of new jobs by re-establishing a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the construction sector. The large scale requires medium-term replacement with economic criteria of old polluting lignite plants with modern, much better performance and anti-pollution technology. The restructuring of the independent authorities is needed in order to strengthen their independent and public interest, to reverse until today the invocation of market rules for the premium for private individuals in strict price control, supply and production functions, with a view to reducing the overall cost of prices. The aim is to integrate them into a public energy policy that will direct and control the market in practices that are compatible with social needs in relation to energy poverty and productive degradation. Reconstructing the energy field can release the country's established research potential in public terms and socially beneficial research results. A coherent energy intervention and planning strategy must further exploit and feed public research into directions such as clean technologies, energy saving systems, autonomous systems on the islands, hybrid systems to cover the targeting of renewable energy sources. Intelligent cash networks technologies, implementation studies for capacity building, small as medium-sized renewable power generation. The aim and objective of the proposed reform of the gas retail market remains the fastest possible reduction in energy costs in industry and in marginal consumption. The increase in the use of gas by direct combustion will differentiate the source of supply. The increase in interconnection at regional and European level, the renegotiation of existing contracts aimed at reducing prices, the extension of gas use to more areas of the country, together with ensuring that consumers can choose a supplier, will lead to price rationalisation in order to reach the European average. Ladies and gentlemen, the settlement of open issues relating to the TAP pipeline is completed in order to ensure on a new basis the greatest possible benefits, both financially and locally. Let's open a parentheses here. The agreement made by the previous governments with the TAP was not a good deal. We are trying - even at the very last moment - to be able to correct what we can correct. Maintaining the strategic position of the public in ELPE - I am referring to the 'Greek Petroleum' - allows international cooperation, the company's evolution to an international energy company with increased export orientation and the company's contribution to the national energy strategy. Based on the current refining capacity of ELPEs, their technological infrastructure and the high technology of the workforce, corresponding policies can be promoted. The new administration has indeed given very good and important examples of writing. And after several years, it seems that '15 will close as a profitable year for the ELPEs. But at this point I would like to make a special reference to the security systems of the ELPEs. You remember the tragic accident that we experienced, and it was the second day that the new administration took over. There has been a very considerable effort to increase the level of safety and improve working conditions within ELPEs. Ladies and gentlemen, the main energy, however, is the development of a long-term energy planning, which has never been developed with credibility in our country, in which the objective objectives and impacts on their implementation will be set, where necessary. In this respect we need to be able to use domestic geothermality. The use of geothermality, which is a continuously renewable source of energy in Greece, does not exist until now and there is no generation of geothermal origin. Another crucial issue is networks and interconnections. The development of interconnections is crucial in the European system and in the wider region of the Balkans. In the Greek system, the existing connections are not very strong and new connections are needed, which should be promoted by IPTO with programmes which, in the context of the promotion of projects of common European interest, will enable us to interconnect with other countries. These are issues relating to the environment and planning. I imagine that the Deputy Minister, Mr. Chironis, will be referring to these issues in detail. I would like to refer to two issues, one of which concerns topicality, and the other has been heard by the previous speaker, a Member of Parliament from New Democracy. Gentlemen of the New Democracy, we all understand the need for our economy to be competitive. It is important what content each one gives to competition. If competition is how each country will compete to dismantle its social system, its insurance system, how it will reduce labour costs, then this is a disastrous and anti-social competition. That is what we are giving it to you. We really want our country to use its comparative advantages, to be credible in the area of innovation, to actually be able to fill gaps in the world market. But you realise that there is a huge distance both in terms of perception and in terms of policies. [[At this point, the closing bell of the speaking time of the Minister is ringing.]] One last. You will give me some time, Mr President, because this is about Skouria and it is about time."", 'Thank you, Madam President. Ladies and gentlemen, I think that today is a good opportunity, in fact, to sum up the measures taken by the Government to support social cohesion during these exceptional conditions prevailing in an international environment with regard to inflationary pressures, but also, of course, to see how this combines and has something to do with climate change, with the climate crisis and with the European strategy to address precisely the causes of climate change that afflicts us. I have listened very carefully to colleagues from SYRIZA, from Acoustic Opposition, and it really seems that they do not realize the Greek reality, but unfortunately they also find it difficult to understand international developments. Because if I may, ladies and gentlemen, a party, it claims to be SYRIZA, supposedly environmental, which supports the continued production of lignite electricity, does not exist in the world. You\'re the only ones in your kind. A party that wants low electricity prices, which wants competitive prices for industry and for professionals, who want to tackle the phenomena and causes of climate change and not agree and question the European strategy, and the Green Deal again, at least, does not exist in Europe. You are also accusing the Government that it has generally proceeded to sell out the fixed assets of the public sector, and I would like to remind you, ladies and gentlemen of SYRIZA, that you too, during your own governance, have proceeded to privatization and privatization. There are also present ministers here, led by this effort. And I ask you: are you accusing the government of selling the DEDEFOP where, for 49%, we received 2.1 billion euros, which is 35% more expensive than the 25% that you sold IPTO? You are charged with selling the infrastructures when we received 730m euros, 40% more proportionately to the price you received for the DESCA, two companies dealing with the natural gas distribution networks! And we come to the last, the juiciest. You blame the Greek Government, the current government, for allegedly selling PPC. We demand 750 million euros from institutional investors and other shareholders, small shareholders, for 17% of the capital increase. For the same percentage, for 17%, you had, Mr Tsakalotos, only EUR 100 million of revenue in the 2018 budget. And I ask: When is a sellout, now that we are asking for 750 million for 17% or when you registered 100 million for the same 17% in 2018? [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] Please answer me in this Chamber. But of course it makes sense, do you know why? Because in 2018 and 2019 PPC’s market value was only EUR 300 million for the entire PPC group. Today the stock exchange value has reached EUR 2 billion. When did the public gain more than that? When did someone have to go to the special court, as they heard here again? You have that very often in your phrase. When did PPC have 300 million or now that PPC has two billion worth? These are simple questions that I think are very easy to answer. And I repeat - of course, we will be talking about this - as we gradually leave the pandemic behind what is the risk of today\'s debate. Let us see the measures taken by the current government much faster than many Member States, almost all European Member States, apart from Spain which at the same time announced some measures. So we\'re taking action. It\'s enough, and what more would you do? Because of what you have said so far, I do not think that, at the end of the day, the price that would end up with Greek consumers would be better for households than we have guaranteed by the mechanism that we have already announced and which does not only concern the current and short-term exceptional situations and exceptional circumstances which have led to \'rali\' prices for European electricity, but also concerns a permanent solution, a permanent mechanism that will deal with the problem and such exceptional situations that may arise throughout the period of energy transition by 2030. Because the risk is to protect households and, of course, to preserve the competitiveness of businesses. So I say very quickly that, so far, the government has taken steps both in terms of the coronary, but also in terms of supporting the global inflationary pressures of EUR 47 billion. And that is why we are continuing to take measures which have been taken from now on to do with the support of households and those who are most in need. But what is the problem, why do we have these increased electricity prices? Because I have heard from SYRIZA\'s colleagues to accuse the government that it is the government\'s fault. That is why I said before that you probably do not understand the international conditions in the energy sector. Today the gas price has quadrupled in relation to its price at the beginning of the year. Within six to seven months, natural gas, MWh thermal costs four times more, has exceeded 60 euros, when at the beginning of the year it cost only 20 euros for thermal MWh. Also, carbon dioxide, greenhouse gas emissions today cost three times more than they cost on average last year. 40% of electricity demand is covered by natural gas and the remaining 10% -15% is covered by lignite, so 50% of the electricity consumption in the country is covered by fossil fuels. So when today we produce electricity from natural gas or lignite, it costs more than EUR 130 and EUR 140, that is, four and five times more than the current cost of electricity from the sun and three times more expensive than electricity produced by the wind. That is why we as government, very quickly, decided by the Prime Minister of the country of Kyriakos Mitsotakis, announced at the climate and global protection summit in September 2019 very quickly degreasing. Not because it is not good to use a domestic fuel, but it is very bad for the planet and the environment and it is even more bad for the consumer pockets. Because after the political decision of Europe, and following political decisions by other states around the world, it will become very expensive in the next few years. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not see you who are supposed to be pro-environmentalists and want to help consumers, households and the environment, to come and support degreasement, the carbonisation of the Greek energy industry. You are talking about and mentioning, in your question, percentages of energy poverty. Have you read the statistics from the European Statistical Office and the Greek Statistical Office on the percentages of energy poverty when you were ruling? Have you read, have you seen the statistics on how many households were unable to pay the electricity bills? It was 40%. It exceeded 40% in 2015. It was kept up and in 2016. It started to deviate, in other words, households began to say that they have a greater ability to pay off their accounts in 2019 and 2020, which has reduced this percentage to 28%. Forty percent of households in 2015, it was difficult to pay the bills. It was 28% in 2020. And de-escalation continues to progress. What is the case with wholesale electricity prices? You caught one month in August: Greece the most expensive one. Manipulation. Please, I\'m waiting for the complaint. I have heard too many times that the market is supposedly manipulated by electricity producers. Make a complaint right away. If you have any such evidence, why don\'t you submit it here? Let\'s see, really, who\'s manipulating. The RAE is, of course, considering every day without question whether unfair practices are observed either in the production or in the marketing. So you caught the month of August. Indeed, in August Greece had an exact wholesale market price for electricity in Europe. Why don\'t you say January when Greece was one of the cheapest countries? Why not say about February, in March, in April, in May, in June, when Greece was on the European average. There were several countries that have much more mature electricity markets, which have much larger productive means, which have much better electrical connections between them. In Central Europe, connections are better, of course. They also have nuclear in their energy mix. It\'s much cheaper when they produce electricity. Why don\'t you just say about all these five to six months and get caught from August? And what about September? There are eight countries which also have nuclear weapons. Some of them are more expensive than the country. Greece has, up to now, had EUR 132,8 per MWh wholesale price of electricity on average in the days we have spent so far. Czech Republic 134.5. More accurate. Slovakia 134,7. Hungary 135,7. More accurate. Belgium 135,8. More expensive. Spain 151,8, is 20% - 30% more accurate. Portugal EUR 152,2 MWh. More accurate. Italy 153,2. Nearly 20% - 30% more accurate than Greece. That\'s the reality. So it\'s not the Greek government, ladies and gentlemen. It is a lot of things that you have done nothing to help them over the five years that you have ruled. It\'s our energy mix. It is because we need to increase the penetration of renewable energy sources. It is because we need to improve our energy networks so that we can receive more RES. What did you do for all this? What investments did the DADIE make, which had no columns to put in to make connections? We came by and tried through new competitions to get columns so we could make connections. That\'s what we received from your government. What have we done in these exceptional circumstances? Did we expect to see what other countries will do? We expected to see what the other Member States would do to support Greek consumers? No, ladies and gentlemen of SYRIZA. Greece, it was the Greek Prime Minister who announced concrete measures to grant the electricity bill to other consumers regardless of their low voltage. They were heard before the measures taken by Spain. Indeed, someone dared to make a comparison and say ""these constitute almost 14% -15% discount, VAT reduction, tax reduction in Spain"". Do you know what a discount means - grant three minutes of KWh? KWh is charged by PPC 11 minutes before the activation of the adjustment clause. Three minutes at 11 is almost 30% discount. Another 3 minutes that PPC will absorb, so 6 minutes at KWh, that means 50% absorption of the valuation. To know what the comparison is between the measures taken by the Greek government and the Greek state, and what measures have the European countries taken after Greece. They help PPC and other private providers. I already see that they have announced measures and commercial packages that absorb a piece of appreciation. But we didn\'t just stop there. We are establishing an Energy Transfer Fund, which has come and is staying. I have heard someone say ""it\'s a clipboard, it\'s not a clipboard."" It\'s a permanent depreciation mechanism that came and stays. We are legislating in the next few days. It will have the auctioning of carbon dioxide emissions. He\'ll have revenues from other environmental charges. It will probably have revenue from the regular budget and there we will support all those in need, all the Greeks in need, the vulnerable, the weakest throughout the energy transition that we have to do, not because someone else has told us, but because we want to protect our country and our planet for the next generations. Unless you do not understand that all we are living today, for example, has been destroyed almost 50% of the production of durum wheat in Canada and the prices of wheat around the world have increased, it is due to climate change. The fact that we have increases in primary products is due to the disasters we have due to the effects of the climate crisis. Can\'t you see that the climate crisis has a price, has a price that actually pays the household, pays it by all the Greeks, pays it by all the citizens around the world? So can we leave that, close our eyes and do nothing and continue to use lignite, coal and emit carbon dioxide in the atmosphere? This causes climate change. Why don\'t you say anything about it? An environmental party you\'re supposed to be. Will you ever say anything about it? Do you want the lignite to continue until 2040? Why don\'t you say it? Your energy and climate plan had lignite by 2035-2040. Do you continue to insist on this? We are starting to talk at least about 150 million euros. Approximately EUR 200 million will eventually be allocated from the emissions auctions to this fund this year. ""But will he be away from something?"" says SYRIZA\'s responsible spokesman for energy. He won\'t miss anything. Six hundred million of the auctions will go to the special account with ELEI to support the RES. Last year was 480 million. One hundred and ten million this year for compensation to support the Greek industry. Last year was 80 million. Fifty to 60 million for lignite municipalities. Thirty-five million was when we received it from you. We double the amount. Of course, 200 million which we have protected throughout this period. Some others were saying we should do something else. We protected them to support Greek consumers. It\'s 200 million. And, of course, we ask both PPC and other providers to come and contribute. PPC has already announced. Are we stopping there? Are we only stopping at what we do inside the country? No, ladies and gentlemen. Greece was one of the two countries - I would say it was the only country - that put forward a proposal for a corresponding mechanism at central level in Europe, so that we can all deal with the problem that we see has come, that it can also do several months until it deviates. We have come and said let us use extra pollutants or pollutants from subsequent years to now create a fund and support the most vulnerable in Europe. And this proposal, ladies and gentlemen, we have formally tabled it to the previous Energy Council and, of course, we have sent it - and I have sent it personally, of course, after the Prime Minister\'s instructions - a letter to the Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr Timmers and to the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Simpson, calling for such a mechanism to be set up and, in this way, to show all European citizens that Europe cares about what is being done, that it does not leave them to work in such extremely difficult conditions and to avoid populism. Why, do you know what the populism is that\'s started to appear? That it was supposed to be about these increased prices that was the fault of European energy policy, that is Europe\'s strategy on carbonisation. That\'s what a populism says. And I\'m watching you today and I don\'t see you separating your position. Please, I submit to Parliament the letter that we sent to the Vice-President of the European Commission. [[At this point Mr. Konstantinos Skrekas presents for the minutes the above letter, which is in the archives of the Secretariat Department of the Parliament\'s Directorate for Stenography and Practice.]] SYRIZA, what\'d he do about it? Has SYRIZA done anything? Has he done there in the international forums where he\'s involved? In the European group - and I do not know what European group you are in anymore - you have made any proposals or all that is being made is pretext here for internal consumption and for your external performance there is total immorality, extremes of the tomb. Are you going to make a suggestion? Will you help Greece\'s proposal if she continues? You\'re going to make a proposal of your own, and if it\'s better, let\'s see it, shall we discuss it, shall we all support it as Greeks? I see no proposal for a central European mechanism to deal with from now on and over the next few years and over the next decades what we are living in today. So you should not try - and I ask - to mislead the world, because you no longer believe you with what you are doing. And we\'re not in 2014 anymore. We\'re in 2020 and we\'re in 2021. I heard some of SYRIZA say that in 2020 wholesale prices had fallen down to low levels and PPC did not make any discounts. Firstly, in 2020 electricity prices were much higher than the electricity prices that you enjoyed in 2015, 2016, 2017, when we had very low oil prices than you remember, but, unfortunately, the Greek Government then failed to exploit these favourable conditions and create a strong growth prospects for our country. However, PPC has also done many things in 2020. In total, it has taken measures that have cost 100 million euros. First, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Forget to say it. Second, 8% discount on consumption of over 2,000KWh. Thirdly, EUR 10 a discount for all those who stopped accepting paper bills and accepting an electronic account. You - let me remind me that - you had gone and put a small piece of 1 euro in each account, for every letter sent to you by PPC. This thing cost about 40.50m euros. It was not too small for consumers\' accounts. And don\'t tell me you\'re here and proceeded to a 15% discount for the timely payment. So what did you do then? You don\'t remember them. We\'ve been talking about it. You went and gave everyone a discount that they could pay. And to those who were unable to pay, to the most vulnerable who were stalling, they paid 15% more expensive. A great success for such a party, which is supposed to support social cohesion and is supposed to be pro-social! It goes to the same thing as the philosopher - environmental and that. From there on, we have taken measures to reduce the cost of electricity permanently, because these are short-term measures that will address the problem now and as long as it lasts. Initially they will last until the end of the year and once we see that these pressures, exceptional and extremely great pressures, at electricity prices, will continue, we will naturally continue to support those most in need, the Greek consumers, the households. But we don\'t stop there. We want to create a green safety net for those who really need it on a permanent basis. For the first time, we make use of EUR 100 million from the Recovery Fund to build, through municipal energy communities, photovoltaics, which will provide almost free green electricity to economically vulnerable. The New Democracy did it, SYRIZA didn\'t do it. You could do that then. There were other ways, but you didn\'t. Just to say it. Secondly, we are completing the connections, in a forward-looking way, of the islands with the mainland. We are bringing forward the final, the great interconnection of Crete. Already in 2021, we will have reduced electricity prices for network charges of more than EUR 100 million. When the large interconnection of Crete is completed, then we will have reductions in the end-use of a network that will reach EUR 500 million, half a billion. All consumers will see that in their accounts. We are moving on to the energy upgrade of the country\'s building stock. This is not the goal of spending a lot of energy, wasting electricity, which will simply be cheap. The point is that we also reduce energy consumption, because the best way to have a lower energy cost is not to consume, but to manage to heat your home satisfactorily in winter and air it, again in summer. How are we going to achieve this? But through the energy upgrade. Over the next five years, we will mobilise more than EUR 3 billion for the energy upgrade of our building stock. We want six hundred thousand buildings upgraded by 2030. Fifty thousand homes will be able to be upgraded to the new ""EXXOCONOLOGY"" we have already announced that the electronic application platform will be opened in October. A huge difference compared to all the previous ""EXOXICOVO"" that we inherited from you. You, as a government, had then set the time hierarchy. Whoever was ahead, he joined the program. That\'s a change. We have criteria now. We have evaluation criteria, with which a hierarchy will emerge, and there will be a prioritisation with transparent criteria, and in this way in a month\'s time they will be able to prepare the applications, submit the applications, the stakeholders and, of course, there will be the eligible, the 50 000 first, and there will also be the participants, and every time we increase the programme budget and the participants will be able to upgrade their home energy. And we\'re doing something else you didn\'t do. We\'re making a special subcategory for the energy vulnerable, 100 million for the weakest financially. SYRIZA didn\'t do it, the New Democracy did it. Tsipras didn\'t do it, Mr. Mitsotakis did it. That\'s the reality. Because, indeed, we are interested and why we are trying to find real solutions, not words. A separate subcategory for energy-saving households with a very large subsidy and for the very small participation of a guarantee fund that will support them to upgrade their home, reduce 50%, 60%, 70% of the electricity consumption and thus the bill they pay. And we don\'t stop there. The rest of the programme for the first time also has social criteria. You did not set a criterion, for example, to have more molecules, to have priority, a family that has a disability member who can be at home all day long and should be warmed up. You had no criteria for a multiple family. You had no criteria for a single parental family. We\'re putting them on. The New Democracy sets these criteria, because, in fact, - I repeat that - we are interested in and looking to find good solutions, not words. We continue and make use of EUR 450 million for energy efficiency and energy upgrading of small, very small, medium-sized and large enterprises to become more competitive on a permanent basis. We are launching a third programme for energy savings in public buildings and road-lighting projects, with a budget of EUR 200 million from the Recovery Fund. We are moving forward and promoting new innovative mechanisms to ensure that our country\'s production base, the heavy industry, the energy-intensive industry and the craft sector, is at a competitive level with great visibility for the next ten and fifteen years. How? Through \'green\' bilateral contracts, a mechanism which we will be tabling to the European Commission for adoption in the next few days. What does that mean? Direct contract between a producer of renewable energy, a photovoltaic and a consumer where he can buy direct green energy very cheap, very competitive for the next 10 years. We are preparing a form of guarantee mechanism from the state so that this can be done. Of course, if we can achieve this, and by subsidising the costs of normalisation, as we say, so that we can really ensure the competitiveness of the Greek production base. We make use of 450 million for storage technologies, batteries and pumping projects so that we can use and import more RES into the energy mix of the country. We increased net metering limit from 1MW to 3MW. A craftsman, a professional can build a photovoltaic with a installed power of up to 3MW and net the rest. Of course, up to 20% you know he can sell it on the network. But we don\'t live there. In the next bill, which we\'re bringing, we\'re doing something very pioneering. We give the possibility of self-production without the limit of installed power. A power-driven industry will only be able to manufacture a photovoltaic for self-production, only for self-consumption, without any electricity being discharged into the network. We\'ll get over the problem of saturated networks with direct cable. And in this way it will be able to identify, synchronize its production when it produces - its photovoltaic, for example - electricity and thus have very low electricity costs, as well as green energy. We are preparing it and we will bring it to legislation - I hope you will support it - in the next few years. We are looking to find ways to help society, help households, help the country\'s productive base. And you see we\'re always bringing arrangements. Let\'s see if, eventually, you\'ll ever come and support. About PPC not to say too many things. The good colleague, the Minister of Finance, Mr Stavuras, said so. You cannot say much about PPC when you reached it in 2019 to have 1.6 billion losses and in 2018 to have about 800 million losses, i.e. to have accumulated losses of 2.5 billion in two years. And you\'re celebrating about this? You come here and what do you say? That you did well, that you protected PPC, that you protected the future of the energy sector in the country? But could PPC raise one and a half billion losses each year? In the end, wouldn\'t you have to come from the state budget - that is, from the taxpayer citizen - and support not to go bankrupt, not to go bankrupt the largest electricity company in the country? How do you come and say that with such lightness? And now foreign institutional investors are coming to buy and pay PPC shares, because they believe in the future, because they believe in the strategy we have developed. Of course, the public remains a key regulator. Of course, it is the shareholder who will also define the administration that will then be approved by the general meeting. And of course it will have the statutory minority, it will have the decisive force for the big positive decisions and, of course, for the management of the company\'s daily lives. And the benefits will be too great. For who? Only for PPC? It\'ll be for PPC, of course. It will have 750 million euros and a further 1.5 billion net money if we take away the loans it has to pay from the TEN, so that with this EUR 2.5 billion it will proceed to direct investment in RES in order to replace and withdraw the lignite plants. So, instead of currently producing lignite electricity that for every plant it sells, for every MWh it goes in, build photovoltaics, build wind turbines, build geothermal systems, so that it can compete and compete in the future, but also helps the country\'s energy mix to get cheap. Where\'s your problem with that?', 'Thank you, Mr President. First of all, I would like to say that I heard almost all the Members who spoke, apart from the time I was gone, because here next to a central hotel we were able today to sign a memorandum of cooperation with the Egyptian Minister for Electricity, Mr Saker. This is a memorandum of cooperation between Greece and Egypt, which defines the framework for promoting cooperation in the construction of an underwater electric cable linking the Egyptian electricity grid to the Greek electricity grid for the transport of green, clean electricity produced in Egypt and through Greece can be exported to the northern countries, that is, to Greece, and to Central Europe. As you can see, there the cost of building a photovoltaic is much more competitive than construction costs in Europe, even in Greece. So through this much lower price of green electricity we will be able to help and ensure both the stability and adequacy of the electricity network in our country, and also to diversify the sources of supply. That is how we will help our electricity flexibility, and on the other hand we will ensure that we are protecting the environment even more and that we are able to achieve our objectives and, of course, that we, as Europe, are more infiltrated into our electricity mix. I too would like, from my heart, to wish Mrs. Gennimata my best wishes. I am sure that with the capacity that distinguishes it and with the help of God she will overcome her problem and we will have it here soon and very strong. I understand, ladies and gentlemen, the well-meaning criticism, constructive criticism, when this is done and carried out by the representatives of the Anti-Population, and indeed on the substance of this, and we ask for it, because we can, in fact, improve legislative provisions and ultimately offer better work and better work in our country and the Greek citizens, because that is our goal. I understand even excessive criticism to some extent, even the lame criticism within the framework of a parliamentary controversy. But what I really can\'t understand is the criticism, especially from the Civic Opposition, by SYRIZA, in matters that the Greek people should forget and leave behind, because these are issues that are still fresh and remembered by the Greek people. For example, I have heard criticism of the PPC issue, and I really cannot understand how it is possible for SYRIZA Members to denounce the Government of New Democracy for the course of PPC and the choices it has made to support the main pillar of electricity production in the country and one of the main pillars of economic development in our country, when they, when they ruled, charged PPC - only in 2018 and 2019 - with EUR 2.5 billion. In other words, in 2018 PPC had 800 million losses and in 2019 it exceeded 1.5 billion losses. That is, if SYRIZA continued to rule, with the choices he had made, PPC would accumulate over a billion losses every year. And they come and speak and judge the PPC government, who took it at market value under 300 million euros! It had been under 200 million euros some time. In other words, the value of PPC, this huge organism, had come to exceed a little the value of a good kiosk in Attica! And they come to compare it with PPC today, whose stock exchange value exceeds EUR 2 billion, and when we have moved on to a 17% conversion, which will bring more than 750 million euros to the company\'s funds, so that it will be much stronger, so that it can move on to investments in renewable energy sources, so that it can replace the old energy sources, lignite, polluting power plants with new investments from renewable energy sources and thus strengthen its position and market share in green energy. So it will also ensure a strong future. How can there be a secure and adequate electrical system in the country without PPC being? Today it represents 65% as a market share of electricity consumption. Is it possible, then, for SYRIZA Members to come and accuse the government of the choices he has made for PPC? PPC has been saved and is now developing beyond the borders of Greece. In my village, however, ladies and gentlemen of SYRIZA, they say: ""Don\'t scratch on the sprinkle of tsapani."" You do this every time, when you speak, because you have ruled five years, on matters that you should not talk about and leave them behind, if the world forgets and sees you with a positive eye. I see that, unfortunately, it is too late to happen. From there on, you have discussed the Special Spatial Planning for the RES and said that there is no allegedly a Special Spatial Planning for the RES. Five years that you have been running, you have commissioned a study to be carried out and completed, for the Special Spatial Plan for the RES, so that investors know where to build, what can they build, where a wind turbulence can be installed, without causing a problem in the natural environment and in the cultural environment and without causing a problem in local communities as well? You\'re talking about marine spatial planning. Did you do anything about the marine spatial planning for the RES? Have you promoted some marine wind support scheme? You didn\'t do anything at all. You asked if we\'ve moved forward and what we\'ve done for storage support. You said here that it is important to install electricity storage systems, green electricity. Five years you\'ve ruled. Did you do anything about it? Have you brought some form of support, some legislative provision for the installation of storage systems in our country, such as batteries? We have tabled a scheme of support for the European Committee on Competition and the European Committee on Energy, so that we can obtain approval. We hope that this will be done by the end of the year. In fact, we have made use of EUR 450 million from the Recovery Fund to install these storage systems and not to cost so much as capital invested in the electricity system and thus benefit consumers, namely consumers, to have much more competitive electricity prices. You asked whether there are natural gas plants and how we withdraw lignite plants, without, on the other hand, having built more modern, of course, much less polluting gas plants. I ask you this. You\'ve been five years. Did you submit any form of support, some availability mechanism, Capacity mechanism, so that investors can take the investment decision and be able today to obtain adequate supplies? On the one hand, for five years there has been no single screw into PPC\'s lignite plants, and as a result they are slowly withdrawn today because they cannot work, because we have said that they will be withdrawn by 2028. We didn\'t say that in 2021 we were trying to put them in place whenever we needed them. There are five years left without substantial interventions so that they can function as necessary and with efficiency for PPC. So don\'t come and talk about things that you don\'t care about. I understand, of course, the criticism - I repeat, even excessive criticism - but not the criticism of matters on which you, unfortunately, have very bad records. From that point on, you came and you even talked about the fires. You said: ‘What did you do for the fire-slapping areas? Have restoration projects, protection projects?’. This also applies to what you should forget, ladies and gentlemen of the SYRIZA, because unfortunately fires of different sizes, smaller or larger - do not matter - occurred in your days too. And what were the results? How quickly have you responded to the protection measures and rehabilitation measures of these regions? Let me give you some examples. In the summer of 2015, we had a fire in Attica that burned five thousand acres, not too much. But it\'s very important. Even a tree burns, it\'s very important, especially when it\'s in a perimeter area. We\'re talking about five thousand acres, but in the summer of 2015. When did the anti-corrosion works start over Attica? They started in the summer of 2016, one year later. At Kineta Attica we had a fire on July 23, 2018. The projects to protect and restore the forty thousand acres that were burnt began in April 2019 and were completed in November 2019, one and a half years later. And I\'m not stopping here. The fire in New Vuja and Matti started on July 23, 2018. That\'s where I think you\'ve put a special weight. Anti-military and anti-corrosion works to an extent of twenty thousand acres began in early 2019 and, indeed, after intervention at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport at the time. The fires in Constantinople began in 2018 and 2019. The works started in 2021 after judicial involvement. So you can\'t talk and say what we did about Northern Evia or Olympia, when at the moment over sixteen forest cooperatives, over five hundred forest workers work over five hundred nights to make anti-corrosion works and in the midst of such bad weather that we have, to protect their downstream areas, the downstream settlements. They\'re people who come from those areas from northern Evia. So how did we do that? Did it happen on its own? No, ladies and gentlemen. We\'ve taken action. We have taken legislative initiatives on two axes. Firstly, we have enabled the direct delegation, the rapid, direct assignment of these works by the forests concerned to forest cooperatives, we have eliminated bureaucratic obstacles and can immediately proceed to such anti-corrosion works. And that\'s how we\'ve done. And not just that. On the other hand, we made use of private sector money, made use of money by those who wanted to show solidarity, by those who have increased their sense of social corporate responsibility. Companies one after the other come and spend millions, invest, grant millions to make these projects. And we didn\'t want any money. We wanted the play. We wanted to make use of the flexibility that the private sector has, through the supervision of the forest, with studies carried out either by the forests or by the private sector, but with the supervision of the forests so that they can immediately - once they are private and do not have these demonstrable procedures under Law 4412, i.e. the Public Procurement Act - direct the work of forest cooperatives - I repeat - in this area, in order to proceed with these projects. And it happened. Today, for the more than half of forest cooperatives, their expenses are covered by PPC, EREN, technical companies and recently by the ""COCA-COLA"" and many other companies, which have come and have been given an increased and intense feeling of social solidarity, corporate social responsibility to contribute. And why should we not use this money and not reduce the burden on taxpayers? A great deal has been said about our intention to reform the environmental inspection framework. So far, how many regular inspections have been carried out and only a category one in class activities in Greece, ladies and gentlemen? As you know, we have thousands of businesses, thousands of companies, tens of thousands of thousands of activities, tens of thousands of activities, which should be monitored regularly. How many people are in control of the time? Is ten thousand checked? Are five thousand checked? Are there a thousand companies in control a year? Five hundred companies are checked a year? They control less than a hundred companies a year. Less than a hundred productive activities are controlled by environmental inspectors, by public environmental auditors with regular audits each year. Specifically, we had seventy inspections last year. Do you think we should leave that? That\'s what we inherited from you. You didn\'t do anything to change that. We come and change it in a way that we believe is very right and we invite you to support and vote in favour of this proposal. Of course, all this is done with the advice and with the contribution of the World Bank and the European Commission who have worked with us for this purpose. Why have some absurd things been heard here by some colleagues who usually engage in absurdity, that we are allegedly violating European regulations and European directives with the law that we are bringing, when all this has been done in full cooperation with the European Commission and the World Bank and using the best world practices on what we have proposed. We remove a number of overlapping or even conflicting provisions that undermined legal certainty and gave legal basis for the removal of fines in the courts. The reform we are promoting is control over prevention and compliance, not the repression that ultimately does not happen and those who violate and destroy the environment, but also have an unfair competitive advantage, compared with those who are lawful and want to protect the environment and observe the law. From a barren ineffective environmental control framework we are now adopting a modern model of compliance, supplementing it with a ministerial decision that we are already preparing directly, with a view to ensuring transparency, avoiding administration arbitraryness, ensuring equality and therefore healthy competition. With the draft Presidential Decree that we are preparing for the private auditors who will come and assist the public sector, administration, controls, we will ensure that we now have systematic regular audits, as required by national and Union legislation. Of course the serious states and developed states have a strong, valid and timely environmental control system that Greece does not have, but we are also trying to change it and we are seeing resistance from you. Instead of being sick, instead of coming here and constructively suggesting some changes, you are \'not all\'. That is, I think, a sterile opposition policy that does not help the country above all, because that is why we are here, all of us from all parties. Because there is no real protection without regular checks. Environmental protection is not done on paper or on paper. What is going on to date, ladies and gentlemen? There\'s been a lot of noise. Is there a categorisation of the infringements according to gravity? Oh, no. Is there an escalation of fines imposed on non-compliant persons? There\'s nothing institutionalized. The fines range from EUR 500 to EUR 2 million, without categorising the infringements and without having an institutionalised mechanism with which these fines are calculated. How do these fines go, ladies and gentlemen? We have a specific mechanism that we are introducing to the vote to define and bind those who impose fines with a specific methodology that everyone will know, will be transparent. How do the fines get in? Tell me about it. I have not seen anyone who is concerned about what we are doing today and whether or not we need improvement. Do you like what\'s going on today? I have heard you, the spokesman from the Communist Party of Greece, say that in the way we do, we do, we do, we help entrepreneurs to go ahead with infringements, that the fines as they enter, there are no charges, they go in the beam, there is no way, and it is not evaluated, and the proportionate imposition based on the mosque is wrong. And I\'m asking you how the fines go today. You don\'t know why there\'s no institutionalised procedure. It is in the control and discretion of the verifier. There\'s an internal algorithm, it says, internally, uninstitutionalized, that we\'re looking to find out who he is. There is no deadline for drawing up an autopsy report. After the performance of an autopsy report, the audited party shall submit its views within at least five days without setting the ceiling. There is no deadline for the completion of the control, with the exception of large industrial installations where it must be completed within four months, due to a corresponding Union provision, that is to say, Europe, and standard practice is eight to twelve months in the end. For other controls, apart from industrial installations, there is no deadline for completion. It\'s all in the air. All infringements shall be transmitted to the prosecutor, regardless of whether they fall under the criminal code or not. And the smallest violations, and they\'re being sent to the D.A. What do we do? We\'re changing everything. The infringements are classified in four categories: low, moderate, significant and very serious. Do you disagree? You want more rating categories? Why don\'t you suggest something? There\'s nothing to be categorized at the moment. We divide them into four categories: low, moderate, significant and very serious. I hear suggestions. For the first two categories which are the largest volume, a conformity plan shall be drawn up, which must be implemented within four to six months, not more than one year, and exceptionally through a very strict procedure for very complex projects up to three years, with the introduction of specific conditions. Is that unprecedented? You as an administration when you governed the country, SYRIZA, did you not give large industry a prolongation of compliance over two and over three years? You gave it. What do we do? We\'re coming and we\'re taking care of this. It will not be done if the auditor wants to or does not want to do so. There\'s gonna be a rule when and how it can be done. For the two most serious categories of infringements, a direct fine is therefore imposed in the event of ongoing infringements. Firstly, even in the low categories, which are of low and moderate importance, where we have anticipated a compliance plan after the checksheet, which should be checked after four to six months and if the controlled person has not complied, then the axe will fall, then the fine will be imposed. If there is a second continuation of non-compliance, a fine shall be imposed everywhere in all infringements, whether moderate or serious or very serious. For the two heavier categories, however, a direct fine is imposed. Therefore fines are imposed on ongoing infringements, infringements involving a direct risk to public health, which threaten with immediate adverse effects on the environment and infringements that are criminal offences. The scope of the fines shall be adjusted according to the importance of the infringement: low, moderate, significant and very significant. The fines are calculated on the basis of specific criteria and are linked to the annual turnover of the activity. This is an optimal global practice that we are implementing, the four categories and within these categories a proportionate fine depending on the company\'s turnover. It cannot enter the same fine in a refinery and the same fine to enter a gas station. That\'s self-evident. This is not the case today. The maximum amount of fines is increased, it is not reduced. We are not abolishing fines, ladies and gentlemen. We\'re increasing them. Up to 2 million was the ceiling. Up to 5 million we set the roof today. Specific criteria shall be laid down to assess the gravity of the infringement, such as the nature of the infringement, the amount of excess of the institutionalised emission limits, not blindly, the relapse and the history of compliance, the behaviour and the degree of cooperation of the controlled body, other lighting or aggravating factors, and whether the infringement is subject to criminal penalties, in accordance with existing legislation. It is planned, ladies and gentlemen, that it is not in the air - today that we are talking about what infringements are subject to criminal sanctions under the current legislation that is currently in force. Of course, the amount of the fine is linked to the annual turnover of the company. The verification procedure shall also be specified in detail so that it is carried out in a uniform manner using standardised control sheets. We standardize the forms used by auditors, why? To ensure that all controlled persons are checked in the same way and not checked according to the appetite, according to the availability or knowledge that the verifier has. What are the steps? In the field of autopsy, clear steps are defined. Temporary control report: Determine a milestone within one month, not arbitrary, not in the air. 14 days for the apology, which may be extended for another 14 days, if requested by the controlled person. A final audit report within forty-five days of the apology, not nowhere. Completion of the final autopsy report within six months for major industrial installations and four months for other activities. We\'re sorting things out. Only violations under the Criminal Code are passed on to the prosecutor, not all of them. The frequency of checks shall be determined for category B projects as well. In other words, we are extending the scope for which the controlled persons should be checked, for which commercial activities, productive activities, activities to be subject to control, to be monitored regularly, and until now only those of Category I projects. It is stated that, if a guarantee is imposed on GDP, the reasons for decline will also be mentioned in GDP. The reasons for the failure of the financial guarantee - unlike what is currently in force - must also be mentioned - which falls by decision of the Director-General for the Environment and not the Minister, of course, mentioned as currently. What does the Opposition say? He insulted us because, he says, we\'re not sending all the violations to the prosecutor. I ask: is this serious criticism? That is, firstly: you understand the burden caused by the referral of thousands of minor cases to the prosecutor every year to so many prosecutors and judicial authorities as well as to auditing bodies, which almost all, based on the experience we have and knowledge now, because this practice has been applicable and applied in our country for years, ultimately end up in the archives after thousands of pages of documents and memoirs have been exchanged. So what do we say? Simple common sense. Only the suspected infringements should be referred to the prosecutor as may constitute criminal offences, as specified in Article 3 of Law 4042/2012. And for those who don\'t understand and continue not to understand what I mean, is it possible if a citizen does a violation, passes by an orange - is it a violation - this violation by the Trochomore, after imposing the administrative fine - then send it to the prosecutor? That is what we say, the very simple one. The representatives of SYRIZA and the parliamentary representative and the rapporteur have said that the checks will now be completely subjective. You said that the evaluation to be credible needs to be carried out on measurable, controlled, technical and objective criteria. And I ask: that\'s what we\'re doing. Why don\'t you come here and support or, anyway, why don\'t you come and help with a constructive proposal to change something in the context of what you want? Because that\'s exactly what we\'ve legislated. SYRIZA\'s representative also added, referring to the criteria, that what we are doing is not done in any European country. That\'s a mistake. What we have standardised, planned and brought to a vote I repeat that we have designed them in cooperation with the European Commission and with its contribution and with the know-how it has in order to implement the best practices currently applied at European level and to be able to change our country, because that is what we are trying to do. The SYRIZA Parliamentary spokesman said that we are establishing an endless procedure when we are coming and setting milestones in which the various parts of the procedure will be completed, and now they are not there. He also said, like other representatives of counter-population, that it is not right to link the fine to the annual turnover. What\'s your proposal? How should we impose fines? I\'m listening. You have a suggestion. What\'s the best way? Isn\'t it a good and proportionate way depending on the cigarette being the penalty? I should also like to inform you that the polluter pays principle is served and applied through the bill that we have brought to the vote. Apart from that, we have brought in provisions concerning waste management and the operation of the EEAN. It has the potential, inter alia, to finance the production of disposable plastics. Why are we doing this? Because we want to make use of revenues from the Greek Agency Recycling, to finance investments in disposable plastic companies. Because we want to enable these companies to move on to the necessary investments and to change their production and thus to remain sustainable, not to lose jobs and contribute to the national economy as well as to our society. We therefore want to make use of revenues from the fees that go into disposable plastics, to lead them exactly to those companies that are being put through the restrictions that we are legislating to reduce the products they produce to change their production process and to remain viable. And I think that this is something you should support. In the Antitrust case and PPC, what can I say about all this? It was heard by the SYRIZA rapporteur that PPC\'s lignite production is supposedly not linked to the energy we have established here and we have agreed that PPC should sell. First of all, it is completely linked. It\'s a percentage of lignite production. In particular, we have stated that for the fourth quarter of 2021, eight hundred ninety-three yards, for the first quarter of 2022, seven hundred and seventy-two yards, for the second quarter of 2022, five hundred and fifteen yards, and these will be reduced as much as lignite production is reduced due to the withdrawal of lignite plants. In other words, in 2022 less than two thousand gallons of lignite production will be available through the stock exchanges, either Greek or international. But why does PPC go and sell to international stock exchanges? First of all, this was an agreement that solved a problem, in a case where Greece had been convicted for decades. Why do we also give the opportunity to sell to international stock exchanges? Because it first starts with the Greek. Since it cannot, it will certainly go to international for us to resolve the problem of the Greek condemnation. And how many are these quantities? They\'re two thousand son-of-a-bitchs. How many quantities were agreed by you as a government to be sold through NOME contests? From ten thousand to sixteen thousand yards a year, eight and ten times more. But the lignite production, how much were those quarters? Do you know that the quantities sold by PPC in NOME auctions were greater than the total production not only of lignite, but also of hydroelectric and natural gas plants? And you come here and give us up! Listen: You forced PPC to sell quantities to its competitors and to traders, which eventually exported this quantity to the northern border of the country, to the foreign countries, to sell the energy with 25, 30 and 35 euros, when PPC now sold 160 euros to the stock exchanges and sell ten thousand and sixteen thousand giants more energy than they produced all its lignite, all its hydroelectric and all its natural gas plants. And you come here and you talk! I told you, don\'t scratch yourself in the sack of chop. You must forget your governance, forget what you are doing and forget about it, and the Greek people see you with a different eye. Don\'t remember them, it doesn\'t interest you. You\'re talking about removing energy costs. You say you made a 12% discount. Who? You proceeded to a 12% discount on those who paid in time. Who pays in time? The poor guy who has no money to pay the PPC account? So the person who paid in time paid a 12% discount and the one who was stalling over ten days on the power bill paid 12% more than the energy. So the poorer paid 12% more expensive energy than the one who had better financial comfort and paid the bill in time. It was a terrible social policy by PPC, which, of course, also went bankrupt and PPC eventually, which accumulated billions of losses. So how many years would he do that? How many years would PPC have gone in, and how much did the gas cost then, ladies and gentlemen of SYRIZA? How much was the cost of oil? How much did the barrel cost? Was he approaching 40 bucks? Was the gas cost from the cheapest in the last decade? Now we have ten times an increased cost compared to then. You\'re talking about 12% discount and we, with the measures we announced, make a 60% discount on the bills. We make five times a bigger discount than you did. So you can\'t come and give up on us. And we do it to all Greeks, not just to the weak, to all households. And give examples of an increase in energy costs in businesses. Mr. Tsipras saw the productive classes. I did not see him announcing any measures to reduce electricity. Something\'s been crippled to reduce, he says, the special ending of oil and gas. Is the current going to do anything about it? The oven burns natural gas to bake the bread? I\'m asking you, because you talked about ovens, does the oven burn oil to bake the bread? It\'s hot. Are you going to make a suggestion about the current? Because until now you have been talking, talking, talking, and talking about the most important thing that is the electricity, the electricity that everyone uses, you haven\'t said anything. We have said that 300 million will give the state a subsidy. PPC and other providers will use over 200 million, a total of half a billion we have secured to cover the valuation. Half a billion for a year? No, ladies and gentlemen, half a billion for the last four months alone. Is there a little 500 million aid through state subsidies and through PPC and other private providers? Is the aid of 500 million for just a quarter of the year small? In other words, it amounts to 1.5 billion at yearly level if it continued, which I hope will not continue. Of course, we have for the first quarter and four months of next year. We haven\'t left them in their luck. This is to understand what those who have ruled and what this government is doing, and that is why you are listening - and I do not think that we are listening to it, but you are listening to it too - ""I am glad that Tsipras does not govern and Mitsotakis governs in these difficult times in this country."" But what did we do about business? Why, for businesses, can we make an energy subsidy? Isn\'t that State aid, Mr. Comrade? You\'ve been through ministers, some of you. What did we do? We did something very important. We have reduced taxes directly and indirectly to make them more competitive. We reduced HISPIA by 22%. We have reduced the tax rate on natural persons from 22% to 9% for income up to EUR 10,000. We have reduced the corporate tax rate from 28% to 24% and moved to 22%, which is from 1-1-2022. We\'re reducing taxes to support business. We reduced the withholding tax rate for dividends from 10% to 5%. We reduced the tax advance on natural persons carrying on business by 100%, which you did, to 55%. Here\'s how we help business. We haven\'t left them on their own. We have reduced the insurance contributions by one unit for all employees and by an additional three units for private sector employees for 2021 and 2022. We abolished the special solidarity levy for the years 2021 and 2022 in the private sector. Of course, we also abolished the tax on parental benefits and donations for every type of asset, up to 800,000 euros, that is, almost all of Greece. What did the SYRIZA government do? Instead of raising the tax-free threshold, in order for the citizens to pay less, they took it down then, and the poor also paid tax. Even the poor, who in the former New Democracy government did not pay tax, paid a tax on SYRIZA. It increased the tax rates for all taxpayers, with the maximum rate rising from 42% to 45%. It increased the tax rates for rent income. It increased the special solidarity levy rates. Increase the tax advance from 55% to 100%. It increased taxation in enterprises from 26% to 29%. Increase supplementary ENVIRONMENT. It increased VAT from 23% to 24%, when they were allegedly cut for the poor and unjust, while increasing taxes on the other hand, paying higher taxes. It also imposed new taxes. You remember, then, the wine tax, the coffee tax, the electronic cigarette tax. That\'s what you did. And what is your criticism of what we\'re doing? ‘But will ELEPE be viable?’ Yes, ladies and gentlemen, ELAP will be viable. With 400 million of the polluter income it will have a cumulative surplus of at least 170 million this year. A deficit of 270 million last year will have a surplus of 170 million this year, a positive change of over 500 million euros. And yes - the representative of SYRIZA is missing, the rapporteur, who is from western Macedonia - EUR 30-35 million, then the lignite municipalities, 40-45 million will take this year. And we\'re trying to find a solution for the district heating, which is a problem because they\'ve put electrodes on and increased the cost of electricity, and we need to find a way to cover them so that they don\'t increase the cost to those who are heated by district heating. Because for all of us we think and try to find a solution within the scope of the possibilities, of course, and stand by and try to do our best. And if we make mistakes here, we\'re gonna fix them, but from you we don\'t hear solutions and corrections. The new \'EXXOCOCONOMO\': I am pleased that Mr Famelos has referred positively to the way in which we have designed the new \'EXOCOCONOMOTO\', and yes we have, Mr President, realised that the raw materials of course have been increased and that the 180 euro ceiling, which we have set per square metre, of the budget that may have a house to upgrade, that is to say, a house with a hundred square meters today, as we have already published - and that is why we have done - the guide to the new \'EXOCONOPOTO\' has a limit of 18 000 budgets to move towards an energy upgrade, which will increase it to 200 euros, so that it has a limit of 20,000 euros. Because the raw materials have actually increased for a hundred square block house. Overall, the limit is 28,000 euros. So a house, no matter how square, will be able to spend up to 28,000 euros. This is the roof so that it can proceed with an energy upgrade, and of course it is intended to upgrade fifty thousand homes. Of course it is a new ""EXOXOCOMOVO"", with much more fair criteria, transparent criteria, abolishing the time hierarchy, criteria that have to do with the cost of the saved kilowatt. What does that mean? Anyone who spends money and achieves better savings has a higher score than the one who spends more money and has less savings. So what did we do in the new ""EXECONOMY""? We have implemented the provisions of the European directive, which we are now coming to legislate and include in Greek legislation. We did it when we planned the new ""EXECONOMY"". But it is not just economical criteria. They are criteria that have to do with society. Multitexts, families who have a disabled person, who can be home all day and spend a lot of energy, so pay a large account of energy products and energy services. They have extra molecules to enable them to upgrade their home and spend less energy. A single-parent family, too. For weak households, for the first time we are establishing a specific subcategory of EUR 100 million, so that the most vulnerable, with a great subsidy, and for the same participation with a guaranteed financial instrument from the state, can be energy-intensively upgraded and give a permanent solution to the problem of the energy account. And so we\'re finally helping through support and subsidy for the piece of electricity. What are we doing about the oil and gas fossil fuels? We are more than double the heating allowance from 80 million to 170 million euros. For a house in the center of Thessaloniki, ladies and gentlemen you are from Thessaloniki, for a four-member family with a heating allowance of EUR 212 that will exceed EUR 400 this year will reach the same house in the heating allowance. We\'re not only stopping there. We went through cooperation with the PPA, which will also work with the other companies - suppliers to give a better price of gas, because it has better contracts and it has bought cheaper gas so that ultimately this discount can be transferred to consumers. A few minutes ago, the Greeks also announced that they were going to a 5% discount on the starting price for heating oil and that they also proceed to twelve interest-free instalments, at no cost, they bear the costs of repaying the quantities that consumers will buy. I repeat, twelve instalments at no cost, which will be covered by the \'ELELANDS\', so as to help households. We are always talking about those who cannot overcome this cost, who unfortunately have increased it and are burdened with trying to warm up their family. So all this comes and is bound up with the Energy Efficiency Bill, ladies and gentlemen, which is, of course, the transition to a new era both for the environment and for our own society. Once again, we are practically proving how the government, Mr Mitsotakis, with our political and explicit legislative will, is now acting immediately and effectively in order to ensure tomorrow in the next generation. The bill is, first of all, about achieving national energy savings targets. Secondly, to strengthen healthy competition in the energy market for the benefit of the final consumer. Thirdly, modernising the environmental inspection framework, as I have told you. Fourthly, the granting of an extension to correct errors and to submit administrative objections to the forest maps that we have previously discussed. Fifthly, the necessary arrangements to ensure the penetration of renewable energy sources and the efficient operation of the electricity market. Sixth, additional clarifications in relation to the management of the EEAN. So we think it is a bill that really offers too much to this place that helps. With regard to the question by the honourable Member, Mr Heta, concerning Amendment No 1105, I would like to say that Article 1 describes the suspension of the authorisation of wind power stations in areas of northern Euboea. First of all, we are revoking existing production licences. In other words, there are applications for production licences which had been authorised earlier. What do we do? We\'re on parole. For how long? We\'ve mentioned it. At the moment, there is the Development Committee, under Mr Beno, which plans in cooperation with local actors and with the local society the new productive model of northern Euboea. There, then, everyone together will design and reconstruct the productive model so as to ensure the sustainability and resilience of society towards the challenges of climate change, against the challenges posed by the catastrophic fires, so that they remain in their villages, remain in their cities and do not leave there. Therefore, through this plan, the uses of land will be identified, the activities that will go ahead will be promoted, and where they will be promoted, so that - I repeat - we will have the best results for those regions from this consultation. So, as far as the means of producing renewable energy are concerned, such as wind turbines and photovoltaics, and those for northern Evia will be designed through this committee, under Mr Beno, in cooperation with residents and local bodies. I therefore call on you to vote on it. It\'s a very fair and structured arrangement that helps. From there on, I would also like to refer to Article 2, in Amendment No 1106, where we are giving an opportunity and doing something that is very serious and very important to the energy-intensive consumers, namely those productive activities, such as heavy industry, which consume huge amounts of electricity. We are therefore able, beyond the increase from one megawatt to three megawatts, which we have already announced and adopted the relevant ministerial decision, to build a photovoltaic that is built on either a plot or a remote area, but it will be connected by direct electrical connection with production only for self-production, only for self-consumption at the same time, without sending a single electron to the system, so that they can also obtain conditions to build it, even if it is saturated in the area. So they can build such a means of production, self-consume and have very low energy prices and of course green energy. This was not the case, it had not been done by the previous government, we are coming and we are doing so, but without limit. In other words, they can build as large a photovoltaic as they need, even a wind generator and transport green electricity directly, by direct cables, to their own production activity and thus be able to make use of the sun or wind, so that they have lower costs and green energy. We also increase by 30 megawatts the installed power of photovoltaics for energy communities in Crete. It was a request that was fair and we come and we implement it. In addition, Article 10 does something that is very important. ELAP shall have revenue and expenses, shall have inputs and outputs. This special account has revenue from EMFF, as well as from the electricity of renewable energy sources, which sells it through the stock exchange in the market. It costs it has the cost of the differential surcharge it pays to the producers of RES that have specific feeds. Now that the price of electricity on the wholesale market is very accurate there are RES which produce energy much cheaper than the wholesale price. The difference, this revenue ultimately has to be made by ELAP, because we no longer have to pay a different fee to these RES, but has revenue from them from the moment it sells its energy to greater value than it actually gives them, this revenue is being legislated here for ELAP to be able to invoice it, so that it can, of course, contribute to the viability of the account.

It was admirably opened by the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish), the Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, who gave the House some really interesting information from his Committee’s report. He was followed by my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh), the Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, who talked about the huge impact that climate change is having on our communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) spoke knowledgeably about the importance of catchment planning and about the Dutch model. My hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) used his experience of working with the fire and rescue services to show why a statutory duty is needed to deal with flooding. My hon. Friend the Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell) shared her considerable experience on this issue and stressed the importance of funding the research being carried out at universities such as York Making communities truly flood resilient is one of our greatest challenges. Flooding varies greatly. The flooding in Somerset was not the same as the floods on the east coast, which in turn were very different from the flooding in Cumbria. The House will be aware of the devastating effect that Storm Desmond had on my community last winter, as well as the previous significant flooding that we suffered. Flooding is not just about water. In Cumbria, it roars down the fells, carrying everything in its path. Drains back up and overflow, and huge amounts of rocks, gravel and trees race along in the water. Floods are incredibly destructive. We have had roads and bridges completely destroyed So what should we do? As has been discussed today, we need to look at the whole river catchment. We need to invest in sustainable drainage systems. And I believe that we need to stop talking about flood prevention. We cannot prevent flooding, but we can manage it and make our communities properly resilient. People are nervous and frightened, and it is time we took seriously the effect of flooding on mental health. Every time it rains heavily—in Cumbria that is not exactly rare—people are scared that the flooding will happen again. The University of Cumbria is carrying out a survey into mental wellbeing. This is an important piece of work on understanding better the effect of flooding and repeated flooding on our communities We also need to look at how we improve emergency planning right across the country. Flooded communities always pull together in an extraordinary way in a crisis, but they feel that there has been insufficient progress due to a lack of leadership, both locally and nationally. We have local flood action groups with a wealth of knowledge and experience, but they feel that they are being kept out of the loop when it comes to decision making and information sharing. That is deeply frustrating for smaller communities, who feel that they are not important because of their small populations. Why should areas such as Barepot and Hall Park View in my constituency be left out because they have only a few homes There have been calls in the Committee’s report for a national flood authority, and perhaps that is what is needed, but, if so, local communities must have a clear route into it. Can the Minister assure me that local flood action groups and communities, including local farmers, will be properly consulted and listened to when we develop the truly holistic approach to flood management that we need? After the floods in Cumbria, the Environment Agency told me that the flood defences that were installed after the 2009 floods did what they had been designed to do. Indeed they did, but they were insufficient for the scale of the floods in 2015. This was also the case in other areas, such as York. They made a big difference in some areas and to some families, but that was little comfort to the many people made homeless at Christmas time The Government have promised more funding for defences, but the costs for Cumbria alone are estimated to be £500 million, and the solutions we need are about much more than building higher and higher walls. The water has to go somewhere, and if we are not careful we will build flood defences that protect one area but damage another We also have to look at planning. There has simply been too much building on flood plains over the years. The Government say that this is no longer a problem as the law was changed in 2009 to prevent building on flood plains, but I have visited two separate areas where houses that had never flooded before were flooded after a new housing development had been built close by. We have to consider the potential impact of all proposed developments on other properties. Maybe the solution is a revised flood impact planning regulation Gravel also causes huge damage to infrastructure, farmland and river banks. Parishes and landowners used to keep watercourses clear of silt and debris. This regular management has stopped, however, and local farmers and residents tell me that that has raised the height of the rivers and that bridges have huge deposits of gravel around them. Bridges can be extreme pinch points and end up acting as dams as they become clogged with debris, which backs up the water again. There are also huge deposits of gravel on the farmland next to the rivers. One farmer I know had a bill for £35,000 to clean up his land after the 2009 floods, and he was faced with exactly the same bill in 2015. How will the Minister ensure that proper river management takes place? Is she prepared to look at an incentive scheme to pay farmers to allow the storage of flood water on farmland to reduce flood risk Household insurance has been mentioned a lot in the debate. Often it is offered either with huge excesses or not at all. Flood Re is welcome, but is in its infancy and does not work for everyone. I welcomed the new British Insurance Brokers Association schemes to cover businesses. They are something I had been pressing for in Parliament and with Ministers, but they too are in their infancy and need to be closely monitored. Business flood claims tend to be for loss of trade, which can be significant, and the consequences for small businesses, which might not be able to get insurance again after previous flooding, can be catastrophic. We need to get to grips with this, or bankruptcies will increase and businesses will close After the 2015 flooding, the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, said that money was no object. The Government must honour that, and provide the resources needed to tackle flooding and the resilience that communities are so desperate for. Since the floods, we have been promised additional capital expenditure but unfortunately little in the way of spades in the ground. We do not have time to waste. Flooding is not going away. We need a comprehensive plan in place for every community at risk of flooding, covering the entire floodplain and the drainage basin. There is no one-size-fits-all solution; decision makers must talk to the people on the ground. Local communities have so much experience—farmers often have land knowledge that dates back generations—and it would be criminal not to use the expertise that is at our disposal. If the Government do not act immediately, we face the severe risk of communities, such as those in my constituency, becoming ghost towns Finally, will the Minister assure me that the necessary funds and resources will be made available, and quickly, to every community at risk? Will she also consider supporting the many excellent recommendations in the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee’s report?', 'I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Greg Smith) on securing this Adjournment debate on a very important topic to all residents of Buckinghamshire but particularly to his constituents. He is a doughty and industrious campaigner on behalf of the people of Buckingham, and tonight, the people of Ickford. I congratulate him on his speech I am sure that my hon. Friend will appreciate that because I have a quasi-judicial role as planning Minister, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss in any detail individual planning applications or individual local plans. However, I am concerned to hear from him that the developer in question has not engaged sufficiently with the local community, or with him. I encourage that developer—indeed, all developers—to make sure that they do engage effectively and properly with elected representatives, as well as the communities concerned The Government recognise that flooding presents a risk to people and to their homes, villages, towns and cities, as my hon. Friend says. The devastating effects of flooding can be seen every year and the Government take it very seriously. The national planning policy framework is very clear that flood risk assessments are needed for all areas where development is proposed that are at risk of flooding from all sources, both now and in the future. Appropriate design and risk considerations that include allowance for climate change need to be included in any flood risk assessment. Allowances that consider future impacts of climate change on flood risk incorporate a precautionary risk-based approach for more vulnerable areas. This means that increased levels of resilience are—indeed, must be—factored in The national planning policy framework sets out a clear, overarching policy on flood risk. It states that inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding, whether an existing or a potential risk, should be avoided, and alternative locations at lower flood risk should be identified where possible; this is known as the sequential test. Where development is necessary and there are no suitable sites available in areas at less risk of flooding, the proposed development should be made safe without increasing flood risk elsewhere; this is called the exception test. Where these strict tests are not met, new development should not be allowed Three national flood zones are identified by the Environment Agency’s flood map for planning. I encourage my hon. Friend to raise his concerns about this matter with the Environment Agency, and specifically about its flood map. Flood zone 3, which is commonly referred to as high risk, is split by a local council into two separate zones, 3a and 3b, where 3b is classified as functional floodplain and has the highest likelihood of flooding. Large parts of many major towns and cities comprise land classified as flood zone 3. Sub-category 3a covers land having a one in 100 or greater annual probability of river flooding, or land having a one in 200 or greater annual probability of sea flooding—possibly not something that my hon. Friend’s constituents in Buckingham are at particular risk of, but I understand his broader concerns I must stress that building on land assessed as high risk is not the same as building on functional floodplain. Even then, building in flood zone 3 is not common, as less than 0.2% of land use in flood zone 3 is residential. Flood zone 2 is classed as a medium possibility of flooding, and flood zone 1 is classed as a low probability of flooding and covers land having a less than one in 1,000 annual probability of flooding from rivers or the sea. Areas at the lowest risk of flooding can still experience localised flooding—for example, following a very heavy downpour. That is why we have prioritised the use of sustainable drainage systems for all developments in areas at risk of flooding. The framework is also clear that sustainable drainage should be incorporated in all major developments—commonly schemes of 10 or more homes—unless there is clear evidence that it would be inappropriate The framework is also clear that a site-specific flood risk assessment should accompany all proposals in flood zone 1—the lowest risk—that involve sites of 1 hectare or more, land which has been identified by the Environment Agency as having critical drainage problems, land identified in a strategic flood risk assessment as being at increased flood risk in future, or land that may be subject to other sources of flooding, where its development would introduce a more vulnerable use Lead local flood authorities must be consulted on surface water drainage considerations in applications for all major new developments. Their comments and advice should inform the local council’s decisions on planning applications and ensure those applications are in line with the NPPF on flood risk. That ensures that local councils have access to appropriate expert advice on the sustainable management of drainage and localised sources of flooding For any major developments within flood zones 2 and 3 where the EA raises objections on flood risk grounds, the local council is required to consult the Secretary of State if it is minded to grant planning permission against the agency’s objections. This provides the Secretary of State with an opportunity to call in the decision My hon. Friend asked what we have done and called for a major overhaul of the system. I can tell him that we updated the NPPF in July this year to ensure that planning policies support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and that includes tackling flood risk. As part of the update, the framework was amended to require that all sources of flood risk are considered—including includes areas at risk of surface water flooding due to drainage problems—and that future flood risks are taken into account to ensure that any new development is safe for its lifetime, without increasing the risk of flooding elsewhere. The framework is clear that areas at little to no risk of flooding from any source should always be developed in preference to areas at a higher risk of flooding, as I have said The framework must be taken into account in the preparation of local plans, and it is a material consideration in planning decisions. My hon. Friend will know that as part of our wider planning reform considerations, we want to put local plan making at the heart of development and ensure that we engage more local people and stakeholders. I assure him that we will be looking at that and the issues he raised as we advance those proposals I should also tell my hon. Friend that, as can be seen from the recent update to the NPPF, the Government are not standing still on the issue of flood risk. Last year we published a policy statement setting out the Government’s long-term ambition to create a nation more resilient to future flood and coastal erosion risk. The policy statement outlines five ambitious policies and more than 40 supporting actions, which will accelerate progress to better prepare and better protect our country against flooding and coastal erosion in the face of more frequent extreme weather as a result of climate change. We want to ensure that we are better protected, to reduce the likelihood of flooding and to increase resilience This year the Government also published their review of policy development in areas at flood risk, examining key elements of planning policy relating to flood risk and development. It concluded that the Government have robust measures in place to protect people and property from flooding, which all local planning authorities are expected to follow. The review outlines the findings and sets out the actions the Government will take and have already taken, which includes further clarifications of policy Mindful of what my hon. Friend has already said, as part of our wider ambitions for an improved planning system we intend to review the NPPF to ensure that it contributes as fully as possible to climate change mitigation and adaptation. I will take careful note of his suggestions in that regard. We are also in the process of reviewing the planning practice guidance section on flood risk to provide further clarification We are also investing to improve our country’s resilience to existing flood risk. This year we have made a record investments in flood and coastal defences, doubling the size of the flood and coastal defence programme in England to £5.2 billion, providing around 2,000 new defence systems to better protect a further 336,000 properties. The aim is to reduce national flood risk by up to 11%, helping to avoid £32 billion of wider economic damage and benefiting every region of the country, including his own Furthermore, the Government have committed to undertake a review of the case for implementing schedule 3 to the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 concerning sustainable drainage systems. The review will look at the benefits and effects of implementation, as well as alternative methods for ensuring that sustainable drainage systems are incorporated in future developments. It will engage a range of stakeholders, and I encourage my hon. Friend and his friends to be some of them. As well as providing for statutory build standards for sustainable drainage systems on new developments, the schedule would make the right to connect surface water to foul water conditional on local planning approval of the developer’s proposed drainage system. The review commenced in October this year and we expect to publish the outcome in August next year I again congratulate my hon. Friend on his persistence in pursuing this very important matter on behalf of his constituents. I hope it is clear to him that the Government take the issue of flooding very seriously and expect it to be an important consideration in the planning system. We also take his views and his concerns very seriously too The NPPF is clear that inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be avoided. Where development is necessary, as I say, it should be made safe and resilient, without increasing flood risk elsewhere. National planning policy applies to all sources of flood risk, including surface water, overwhelmed sewers and drainage systems, as well as future risk. We are committed to reducing the risk that flooding poses to our communities. We acknowledge that climate change will increase the risk of flooding, and that is why we have strong protections in place, including the £5.2 billion of investment that I referred to, and we will work hard on our further reforms to ensure that we further protect our communities against flood risk I congratulate my hon. Friend on his work on behalf of his constituents in Ickford and elsewhere. I trust that the developer to whom he referred is listening and will engage with him and the communities that are affected at the earliest opportunity. I congratulate him on his debate, and I look forward to working with him in future to ensure that flood risk in all of our communities is effectively mitigated Question put and agreed to.', 'As ever, it is a pleasure to have you with us tonight, Madam Deputy Speaker. We have a small group of people here, but thank you none the less. I congratulate the hon. Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Layla Moran) on securing this debate. As she says, it is her second debate on flooding in her constituency, and she is raising awareness of the risks of flooding. She has also written to me recently, which she referred to, and I am happy for the contents of that letter to be shared with interested parties if that is helpful, as it covers a number of issues. Flooding is a real and increasing risk for many people across the country. The Government take it extremely seriously—I am sure you have heard me say that many times, Madam Deputy Speaker—and recognise the devastating impact and harm that flooding can cause, affecting people’s livelihoods, lives, businesses and communities. The Government are doubling the amount that they invest in flooding and coastal defence in England to £5.2 billion between 2021 and 2027 The hon. Lady stated clearly that she did not want the Minister to mention how much the Government have committed or want to spend on flooding, but I think that is incredibly important, particularly as we have doubled the funding, which shows the Government’s commitment. That funding will provide around 2,000 new defence schemes better to protect a further 336,000 properties in every region of the country. That includes better protection for homes and non-residential properties such as schools, hospitals, transport links and utility sites The investment programme aims to reduce the national flood risk by up to 11% by 2027, and it will help to avoid £32 billion in future economic damages, providing economic benefits across the nation and supporting job creation; although this debate is about Abingdon, I thought we had to note that. The hon. Lady will recognise that it is important to invest money fairly and well throughout England, ensuring that we secure value for money as we aim to protect those most at risk Let us now turn to the hon. Lady’s constituency of Abingdon. I am mindful of the challenges that the town has faced, and faces, and particularly the flooding experience of 2007, when more than 400 homes were flooded by the River Ock, and water levels exceeded the 1947 flood, which I am sure people in her constituency still talk about. Over recent years, the Environment Agency has taken action to reduce flooding in Abingdon, including increased levels of river maintenance, the provision of a flood wall along St Helen’s Mill, and a robust deployment plan for temporary defences, should they be needed Thankfully, this winter, these temporary defences were not needed. The Environment Agency responded to the high river levels in the Abingdon area during Storm Christoph, from 19 to 22 January, including by issuing flood alerts and warnings. During the peak water levels, the Environment Agency field team were up 24 hours a day clearing trash screens and bridges to allow the water to move more freely. I welcome the fact that the hon. Lady acknowledged the hard work that those from the EA certainly do. It really is thanks to this work that there were no reports of property flooding this time Of course, that is a reminder that there is always a flood risk—it is still there. The Environment Agency’s modelling recognises that some 561 properties in Abingdon are at risk from fluvial and surface water flooding, which is flooding that that has a one in 1,000 chance of occurring in any given year. That is why the agency continues to work in partnership with the Vale of White Horse District Council, Oxfordshire County Council and the Thames regional flood and coastal committee to find ways to further reduce flood risk in Abingdon. The hon. Lady mentioned working with all these different groups, and that indeed is what the Environment Agency is doing Back in 2018, the Environment Agency investigated the development of a flood storage area upstream of Abingdon on the River Ock. The investigations found that while a flood storage area was technically feasible, the benefits it would provide would not be much greater than those delivered by the Environment Agency’s routine river maintenance. The flood storage area would have provided better protection from flooding to 30 houses initially; when climate change is taken into account, that drops to just three properties at the end of the scheme’s lifetime. That means that the flood storage area would deliver additional benefits worth only £2 million to homes and businesses, but they would come at an estimated cost of £10 million. Quite clearly, it did not represent value for money to the taxpayer, and that is why this option could not be progressed. I asked particular questions about that to check up on the detail of it It is of course always disappointing when a flood scheme cannot be taken forward, especially for local residents who feel that it would have provided better protection for them and their neighbours. However, our funding policy is designed to be fair and equitable, and it remains people-centred: it focuses the case for Government support more on households, and so on people, than on gaining other economic benefits DEFRA’s partnership funding approach helps to make the grant in aid funding go further. The partnership funding policy clarifies the level of Government investment a scheme will secure, so that it is clear what funding communities need from other sources to allow projects to go ahead. Partnership funding can be secured from a range of sources, including local beneficiaries, partners and growth funds. However, it is worth noting that the local council was engaged in this bid, and it itself concluded that it was not value for money, as I am sure the hon. Lady knows However, we do not rest on our laurels when it comes to the funding framework; we consider how it might be improved to reflect our changing climate—and it is changing. The hon. Lady rightly mentioned this. We are getting more frequent extremes of weather. Last year, the Government announced amendments to the partnership funding rules to ensure we better recognise the full range of benefits that flood schemes can bring The hon. Lady may be interested to know that, on 1 February, we launched a call for evidence to explore whether any specific changes should be made to strengthen the assessment of local circumstances in the new 2021 to 2027 investment programme. This includes looking at the funding formula to see if we can provide further benefit to frequently flooded communities. That was something I specifically made a point of highlighting, as did the Secretary of State, because there are lots of communities that are frequently flooded, but perhaps do not have the big numbers of homes needed to attract funding under a particular funding formula. The call for evidence is also further exploring ways of increasing the uptake of property flood resilience measures that enable householders and businesses to better prepare for flooding While the flood storage area is one proposal for alleviating the problem in Abingdon, there are alternative ways to further reduce the risks and impacts, including the flood wall at St Helen’s Mill, which I have mentioned, and the temporary defences. The Environment Agency is reviewing further suggestions from the local community flood group, and I know that a very active local community is working on this. I believe it is called the Ock Valley Flood Group, and its input is much valued. It is looking at whether there is scope for the temporary flood barrier alignment to be made into a permanent defence, and the agency is gathering evidence on whether this would be technically and economically viable The Environment Agency is also investigating whether natural flood management options would be effective in contributing to reduced flood risk in Abingdon. It is working in partnership with the Freshwater Habitats Trust, and they are engaging with landowners who have expressed an interest in introducing measures such as tree planting to hold back the flow. These investigations will be concluded later in the year, but obviously this has to work all the way round for everyone. The hon. Lady rightly mentioned farmers, whose crops also have to be protected from flooding, so there needs to be a balanced approach. Should natural flood management be included, the landowners would have to be fully involved, and would have to engage on the question of whether that scheme would work for them Before I wind up, I want to touch on a couple of points raised. The hon. Lady mentioned the South Hinksey area, and yes, there were high river levels this winter on the Thames through South Hinksey. The Environment Agency used temporary barriers on Christmas day and again at the end of January, and successfully prevented flooding to properties. The agency received very positive feedback from local residents, but this seems contrary to what the hon. Lady has told me today. I think she mentioned that people were not happy, so that needs a bit of clarification. Anyway, the South Hinksey temporary defences are due to be replaced by a permanent flood bund as part of the Oxford flood alleviation scheme, so I hope that gives her some assurance The hon. Lady also mentioned Yarnton and Begbroke. They were affected by surface water flooding, and three properties were flooded recently in Yarnton. No properties were flooded in Begbroke. The risk to those communities is, as I said, from surface water flooding, which is the responsibility of the lead local flood authority. The EA therefore does not have plans for permanent or temporary flood defences at those locations, but it is ready to work with the lead local flood authority and other partners to help with possible mitigations for those communities, and I urge them all to get together and do that On the question of funding, Oxford is receiving a large amount of money, and where costs do stack up, of course schemes are going ahead. The Oxford flood alleviation scheme will cost around £150 million and is one of the biggest flood schemes in the country. Construction on the scheme was expected to start in 2020, subject to a compulsory purchase order. However, Oxfordshire County Council found that a bridge was in need of replacement, so that has to be sorted out before progress can be made, but surely it will be made. The benefits of this programme to the huge wider area of the community will be really significant. Similarly, the EA is working with partners on the Thames Valley flood scheme, which involves a wide catchment approach to mitigating the increasing flood risk resulting from climate change I thank the hon. Lady for raising these issues, and I hope I have given her some assurances tonight and also in her letter. If she wants to follow up with me on any of these issues, I am of course happy to discuss them, because we want people to be assured that the Government are taking flooding seriously. Indeed, I hope I have conveyed that I believe we are taking it seriously. Not every flood mitigation proposal will go ahead, but I think I have highlighted that there are many ways of skinning a cat, and many approaches to flood mitigation, all of which need to be taken into consideration with all the different partners brought to the table, including our MPs who are standing up for their constituents. I believe that that is the way forward Question put and agreed to.']","<|system|>

Thank you very much, Madam President, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. In fact, I rise to this rostrum to request the validation of Royal Decree-Law 15/2022, which provides for urgent measures to combat forest fires, and I would like the first words of my speech to be recalled with regret to the three fatal victims and the wounded, some of them still hospitalized, who have caused this summer's fires that have devastated our country. [[Applauds]] I want to convey to their families my affection and the accompaniment of this Government at hard times, and also the affection and interest that we feel for the neighbours of those municipalities that have been evicted, that have been affected at some point by the extreme conditions that they have had to suffer as a result of these fires, trusting that they can recover normality as soon as possible. That is the intention of the Government, an intention of the Government that has already been reflected in the agreement on areas seriously affected by an emergency of civil protection from the fires of our country during the months of June, July and August, adopted precisely this Tuesday by the Council of Ministers. But I would also like to thank the enormous work of the Civil Protection teams, the forest agents and firefighters, the state security forces and bodies that have participated in the extinction of the forest fires that took place this summer in a very large part of the national territory, because I recognize in all these workers the best image and the greatest commitment of our country's public services. [[Applauds]] Ladies and gentlemen, we live in a country rich in biodiversity, the second with the most forest area in Europe, a territory, a country that is located in a climate transition zone, a Mediterranean climate that has traditionally forced us to take extreme precautions in the face of forest fires and to combat them with important human resources, materials and regulatory measures of different scope, with obviously involvement by the competent administrations, autonomous communities and outlaws. It is a Mediterranean climate that is, however, changing. Climate transition zones are facing an increasingly harsh and complex reality. We do it in the Mediterranean and in those other countries, in those other places with equivalent climate, such as California or Australia. The impacts of climate change are evident in our eyes, clearly showing what science has been warning us for a long time. Because let me remind you of an obviousness that some still do not want to look ahead to and pretend to deceive citizens: climate change is science, it's observed data, it's data, unfortunately, with huge economic and social impacts, not only with immense environmental impacts. So, ladies and gentlemen of the extreme right, stop talking about climate change as a religion, because it is neither religion nor question of faith, it is not witchcraft, it is not magic, it is a drama and a responsibility of our generation. [[Applauds]] This year is a good example not only in Spain, but in the rest of Europe and in a very good part of the world, where we see how the changes are accelerating dramatically: heat waves, extreme droughts, rivers that run out of water, forest fires that have left us a very good part of the territory with huge problems. These natural factors are compounded by other socio-economic factors that must be given great attention and for which we must be responsible. We must work from all administrations with the utmost seriousness, with the greatest coherence. Limitations arising from the phenomenon accumulated for decades associated with depopulation, decrease in traditional forest and mountain management activities, activities related to bioeconomy that have been losing value precisely because the importance of this management of the territory, a value that cannot only be symbolic, which must also be economic, has not been valued. The truth is that it is no longer enough to identify positions of the territory or weeks of greatest risk, we need to strengthen and consolidate a precautionary treatment and a cross-cutting response to the challenge we face. This face of forest fires is precisely one of the most dramatic, one of the most visible in our country. Climate change explains that heat waves are three to four times more frequent than in the previous four decades. Climate change explains why days of high or extreme risk in the Mediterranean region in relation to fires have increased between 10 and 40 days a year. The report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last June already warned that the forest area burned in the Mediterranean area could double or triple its extent as CO2 emissions increased and temperatures increased. Speaking very graphically by the World Meteorological Organization, by its Secretary General, Petteri Taalas, heat waves are becoming more common because of climate change. We have provided the atmosphere with more greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide, so warming and other trends will continue until at least 2060, regardless of whether or not they are successful in mitigating climate change. I am clear that we must succeed, we must fight climate change. And it is not enough to join the headline and then, however, to sing the measures, questioning or joking about the measures, gentlemen of the People's Party, because energy transition is not to call things frivolously, energy transition is to take the change of energy model seriously. [[Applauds]] In Spain, in the European Union, fire data from 2022 corroborate the statements made by the scientific community. The national climate advance of the spring of 2022, brought by the State Meteorology Agency, marked that this month of May has been the warmest of the last fifty-eight years, data that allowed us to anticipate what was going to be the summer of 2022, a summer much warmer than usual. It's been like this. Last July was extremely warm; its average temperature was the highest recorded in Spain, not only in July, but in any month since at least 1961. We suffer average temperatures over peninsular Spain of 25.6 degrees, a value that remains 2.7 degrees above this month's average in historical records. Waves of heat that add up to more than thirty days, many of them consecutive, with night temperatures classified as tropical nights more than six nights in a row. So let me remind you again of the obvious: it has not only been hot because it is summer. No more jokes. It has been as hot as ever since we have data and perhaps, as some experts warn, this may be one of the coolest summers of our lives. Extremely worrying are also the precipitation data. The precipitation data accumulated during the hydrological year beginning on 1 October, i.e. from 1 October to 16 August, show an accumulated reduction of 26 %. We have suffered an extremely dry year, which explains why the reservoirs have been below 37% of their capacity, the worst since 1995, which is why we convened the drought table on 4 March. Thanks to the measures we adopted in Decree Law 4/2022 of 15 March, we have been able to manage reasonably, without cuts, beyond what might be foreseeable at this time, those decisions that have guaranteed access to water. A table that has been combined with dialogue with urban water cycle operators. On the European scale, according to the report of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre, after analysing the data provided by the European Drought Observatory, it is clear that Europe could be experiencing the worst drought in five hundred years. The Loire, the Rhine, the Danube, our reservoirs, the reservoirs in Portugal are a good example of this, with economic, social, energy consequences and, of course, with fire consequences. Future projections show a upward trend in temperature and precipitation reduction, as highlighted by the World Meteorological Organization, the United Nations Climate Convention or the United Nations Convention on Desertification; that is, we are heading for even warmer and more fire-prone summers. Therefore, that basic legislation that we have been implementing for decades needs to be updated. We need to update, deepen, improve the means at our disposal and the capacity to react, the best coordination, the best training. Let me summarize the forest fire data in 2022. On 19 August, there were 7613 casualties, with a total area burned to more than 229,000 hectares. The number of large fires, with an area of more than 500 hectares burned, has been fifty in what we have been doing all year. The data of these calcined hectares is well above the historical average; the data on the great fires is the worst of the last decade: more and more fires are becoming more difficult to extinguish, more complex, even in some cases with difficulties to guarantee physical means, rest, conditions to be able to operate in an early and calm way. So let me again express gratitude and gratitude to all those involved in these tasks. [[Applauds]] If we look at Europe, the data is chilling. One in three of the 700,000 hectares that have burned this year has done so in Spain, and this forces us to react together. To personal, material, environmental damage, is added an impact that is difficult to recover, the emotional impact for the neighbors, the impact in terms of biodiversity, whose recovery often takes decades, if it comes to be achieved. All that I have said so far without reducing the other great concern, the other great variable to which I referred at the beginning, socio-economic factors to which we must pay particular attention and give the appropriate response. Measures to combat depopulation must be implemented to reverse the growing abandonment of mountain management; to promote activities related to bio-economy, because it is essential to anticipate and reduce the risks that climate change poses in terms of fires; to facilitate a balanced recovery of the population in our territory, with a recognition of the important economic and environmental task that managers in the territory, who are our convecinos of rural Spain, carry out. But it is also essential to strengthen our system of forest fire prevention, surveillance and extinction from all that we have learned and accumulated over the years, from improvements in coordination between public institutions, from serious work to be carried out throughout the year, not six weeks or two months or three months, throughout the year. Both in prevention and in extinction and restoration, common and well-coordinated work is required by all actors. The more we achieve this comprehensive and shared strategy, the more effective we will be in prevention and rapid action when the risk materializes. Therefore, prior to the adoption in the Council of Ministers of this decree law, on 28 July, the strategic guidelines for the management of forest fires in Spain were published, setting out the lines of action for the prevention and extinction of forest fires, in which the teams of all the competent administrations have been working in order to be able to have a reinforcement and a deepening, a task that demands more and more professionalism, A greater means, greater effort. These guidelines were drawn up by the Committee to Combat Forest Fires, adopted unanimously at the Sectoral Conference on the Environment at its meeting on 28 July. The updating of the Mountain Law that operates this decree law is a reflection of these guidelines. In the area of prevention, it is proposed to amend article 48 of the Montes Act, a basic requirement which we believe should be modernised, made more effective, facilitating the use of key planning tools in the prevention, surveillance and extinction of fires. Therefore, the decree law incorporates that before 31 October of the year preceding its implementation all - autonomous communities, deputies, state - we must approve and publish those annual plans that allow us to prevent, monitor and extinguish fires continuously. It is no longer worth thinking only, he said earlier, in a few weeks or in some specific geographical areas. These plans are designed as instruments of preferential management for territorial policies, but they are also key tools for dissemination, transparency and shared learning. The Decree-Law incorporates on a basic basis the guiding principles and the minimum contents of the updated plans after years of implementation of the Montes Act. For the first time they are conceived as tools for the whole year and throughout the territory and, of course, they cease to be weeks or specific areas and require the best knowledge of the citizens, they require the best involvement of all administrations. The plans should include, from an integral point of view, those issues related to the prevention and extinction of fires; identification of areas according to their risk: design of devices throughout the year; provision of means and personnel; regulation of risk uses and, in general, those aspects that may have an impact on the defence of the natural environment against fires, on the protection of people from fires, always with the capacity to improve, strengthen from this perspective of the competent administration much closer and more knowledgeable of the territory. They are plans that are more far-reaching than those planned so far by their territorial scope - covering the whole territory - for their permanent implementation, for the inclusion of reinforced preventive measures, such as a common minimum of implementation throughout the national territory, a permanent allocation throughout the year. Because, in the absence of good preparation, we endanger the lives of people, neighbors and workers at the time of extinction. The new plans improve transparency in the implementation of skills in the prevention, surveillance and firefighting, which obviously fall on the autonomous communities and make it possible to learn about the measures taken in each territory. On the basis of solidarity, the various administrations are doing well to provide additional means from one autonomous community to another, or to strengthen where it is needed by the State. But - let us not forget - a country that knows its risks and is prepared to face them is a safer country, a better country for its citizens. [[Applauds]] The question, therefore, is: do you not think it is essential that these plans, which are known in advance, have the right information, precision and commitment so that risk prevention and a much more effective reaction capacity can be put into practice? We, the Government of the nation, also feel obliged to do so. This year we have contributed means for the extinction of fires in many autonomous communities: Castile and León, Castile-La Mancha, Extremadura, Galicia, Asturias, Valencian Community, Navarre, Aragon, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, Catalonia, Murcia, Andalusia and Euskadi. We have intervened by providing support to our Iberian neighbour, Portugal, who has also suffered major forest fires this summer. We have had a very important air and ground capacity that has been at the edge of the effort, both by people and by the air support means. We have had 10 high-capacity amphibious aircraft, six medium-capacity aircraft, eight bomber helicopters and nineteen transport and extinguishment aircraft, plus ten other ground cargo aircraft and four coordination and observation aircraft. A total of 7,000 flight hours had been flown until 14 August; 7,000 flight hours, when the average of the last five years had been 1788, had been used to give them a graph of the extent to which this had been a particularly harsh year. We must be prepared that, if they are repeated again in the future, we will have the appropriate means to respond. In terms of land resources, seven analysis and planning units, ten Forest Fire Reinforcement Brigades, four comprehensive fire prevention teams, plus Civil Protection and UME support, along with State security forces and bodies, have been established. In short, we have made a great effort to support the autonomous communities that we think deserve that we all take a step forward in the management of our own competences and in the framework of greater solidarity and coordination among all in order to strengthen the means at our disposal. Instrumental coordination is also improved and clarified in measures such as the adoption of a common protocol for air assets, the quantification and qualification of extinguishing equipment according to its characteristics and minimum safety training conditions, so that there is no worker at risk for not having either individual protective equipment or adequate training for the task requested of him, all of which obviously in coordination with the competent public administrations and without prejudice to the capacity for improvement which many of them have shown, although I would also like to point out that not all of them have demonstrated that effort and commitment. Another of the measures contained in the Royal Decree Law for the improvement of risk prevention and control is that in cases where the State Meteorology Agency - and, together with it, the agencies of the autonomous communities in which there is an equivalent meteorological service - foresees a very high or extreme risk, the limitations and prohibitions of risk activity can be applied... [[Rumors]]"", 'Thank you very much, Mr President. It is not just the time that we are going to use to discuss the issue that has been dominated by news in the last month. I am obviously referring to the catastrophic fires that have hit our country. I believe that the quality of the debate will also be an important aspect, if we are able today to respond frankly to the real questions raised by the citizens, but also by the opposition, and if we are able to reach at least a few axes of agreement on how to deal with forest fires from now on. The great challenge that the climate crisis imposes on us is to launch policies to tackle it. Let me start by saying that, as in our home country the risk of large fires continues, our thoughts and I believe that all of us are thinking about those and those who are still fighting or staying on guard on the front line, civil protection and firefighting, the Armed Forces, Police, Government, and our volunteers everywhere in the country. The thousands of human lives that have been protected in the throat reflect their devotion, their oppression, their sacrifice, and what we have lost, all we have to resurrect and resurrect. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] As I have said to you, I expect today\'s debate to differ from ordinary parliamentary debates and its subject is indeed a problem not just of national but of global dimensions, with an importance that goes beyond party visas and with a common request for answers to four questions that concern citizens. Question One: We prepared, as needed for this year\'s fires? Question two: What went well and what went wrong in the flame fight? Question 3: How will local communities and fire-fighted ones be supported from now on? Question fourth and perhaps more substantial: How will we tackle the effects of the climate crisis in the medium term? I shall therefore try today to answer these four questions frankly. So, first of all, how much were we prepared for this fire season? I believe that the image here is quite clear, with its positives and its negatives. In a fire attack, which the country had to experience many years, we managed not to mourn victims, although we lost Santa, a heroic volunteer. We protected thousands of our fellow citizens. But property was destroyed, fortunately not as much as the size of the fire would make us wait, but a very large piece of forest wealth was destroyed, a little more than a million acres of green. And this is the bitter cost of environmental change, which this year was combined with a painful heat and spread its fires across the Mediterranean. I would remind you that it was not only Greece that was faced with catastrophic fires. Turkey was found, Italy was found, Algeria was found, as in previous years Portugal and Spain had been found. However, it is certain that this summer has become much more difficult to manage, because this prolonged heater, a heater we had to experience in our country since 1987, has actually turned all our forests into reservoirs. That is precisely why, because we had intended to invest in Civil Protection, we managed and converted it, within a relatively short period of time, from an inert service to an abandoned office, into a fundamentally worthy state entity, with infrastructure, staff, budget and project. And those who doubt it, let them just try to remember the name and work of the predecessor of Nikos Chardalia. I do not remember it, however, and I do not think that the majority of Members who are here today are remembered even. So very important things have been done in the area of civil protection. “112” was triggered, which was my personal pre-election commitment - following the traumatic experience that the country experienced in 2018 - and “112” proved its worth. The fire extinguisher before this anti-nuclear period was reinforced with new strains, new vehicles and strengthened, yes, and with air means for which so much discussion took place. In particular, it was strengthened by seventy-four air means, sixty-nine involved, plus five which are the property of the Fire Corps. These are the air means at our disposal this summer and they are more than ever. Whether it was enough or not, I am prepared to discuss it, but it cannot be disputed that the country had provided itself with more airborne means, some of which were, in fact, tested for the first time, for the first time, such as those known to all trawlers, that is, small aircraft, which can carry a significant amount of water for their weight and which have proved extremely useful in the first insult of a forest fire. I will come back to this later. At the same time, we had intended to clean up and intervene in twenty-one, namely, dangerous areas which had characteristics similar to the case of Matti, cases of settlements that were very close to forests, that is, where this very problematic stimulus between the forest environment and the structured environment exists. In fact, I myself participated in a teleconferencing conference with eighteen mayors - this was on 24 May 2021 - where I made it very clear that we must all work together - central state, self-government I and II - so that we can ensure that we can reduce the amount of fuel in these settlements, as much as possible, but also have escaping plans so that in the inappropriate case we need to evacuate such a settlement, we can carry out this complex procedure within a short period of time and with the necessary order. And, indeed, these interventions were made. I mention two cases of settlements: One is the Hippocratic State, where the fire has reached the limits of the Hippocrates State. But it did not actually enter the settlement, precisely because we had intended that the cleansing should take place. And of course, for the first time, there was an escape route in the Hippocrates, a new escape route, so that citizens can get away safely and quickly. The second area, which was threatened by the fire, is an area that is very familiar with you, Mr. Tsipras. And I\'m talking about Sunio. I am referring to Sounio, in particular, because, as you have seen, if you move along the road connecting Sounio to Lavrio, there are two routes of escape with labels to the sea, which suggest to the citizens how they can reach the sea if they need to be removed, in a very difficult area, as it is surrounded by forest and the only way out can be the sea. So this was done and led to the relative destruction of the property in houses that were found either within the forest or around the settlements. The reality is that despite the intensity and size of the lights we were called upon to manage, no settlement was burnt to the ground. We have therefore achieved our goal of protecting human life, we have succeeded in our aim of protecting the settlements, we have achieved our goal of protecting the critical infrastructure. There are very few who are aware of the enormous effort that has been made, especially in the fire of Barumbas, so that we can ensure the electrification of the Lecade. I would also like to thank both the executives of the IPTO and the DADIE, because they have made superhuman efforts so that we do not have losses in the electricity supply of Athens, because at some point the fire has reached very close to extremely critical infrastructure in Krioneri and Agios Stefanos. But this summer, in the first days of August, we were called to manage a thousand two hundred and seventy - nine fires, almost sixty a day, in many different places at the same time. Many, we know that now, it was a product of arson. Most importantly, however, ladies and gentlemen, it is about the fact that these fires this year had some different features from fires that we have been called upon to deal with in the past years. It is explained by the National Meteorological Service and by the scientists. I don\'t want to read complicated technical posts. However, it is certain that what we all saw from television receivers was also being dealt with by firemen in the field. Inner fire turbines reproduced it, so that flames erase much harder even when they accept water ruptures from aircraft. And the best example of this reality was the last fire, which we were called upon to face in Bilia. The entire state mechanism was activated in Vilia. There have been hundreds of water drops from aircraft. All the forces of the Lecade Firehouse were practically mobilised, including the forces that came to support us from abroad. And yet, despite this very great effort, we have had three days to delimit the fire. Is there a mistake? If you think there\'s been a mistake, tell us. Didn\'t the firefighters do their job well? Didn\'t the pilots know where the water was? Wasn\'t there coordination? Come tell us, then, and tell us exactly where the mistake has been made in this particular fire. The reality, however, is that we were called upon to face fires with very different characteristics, within forests, where there was often absolutely no access from any forest road, forests that had been unintentional for decades. And the truth is, these fires when they escape the possibility of intervention of the first insult, become extremely difficult to manage. I would also like to remind you - because I have heard many dreadful comments about the firefighting, comments very unfairly about the people who gave the battle to the field and gave it many times without even being able to rest, without sleeping, have been awake days - that this firefighting has managed and controlled the overwhelming majority of the fires in turn. All the fires, which we hear nothing about, are fires that were erased at the beginning. Unfortunately, however, and this is the reality, some have escaped and been faced with a reality, we must manage four major fires in different parts of the country, a intensity of a phenomenon that went far beyond our fortresses. The phenomenon surpassed the preparation that we had done. I said it very open, very clear. We were prepared better than any other years. This preparation was obviously not enough to be able to cope with the intensity of this phenomenon and the result is what I have spoken about to you, namely that we may have fewer damaged properties in relation to what some may have expected, seeing the extent of fire, but we have lost more than a million acres of forests. And that certainly is something that obliges us to see in detail what went wrong and, above all, what we can do better from now on. As I told you, the sacrifice of our firemen and our volunteers has been repeated, but the mistakes have not been missed. It turns out only nature makes no mistakes. This year\'s fires, as I told you, if they taught us something, are that absolute priority in the management of fire, in the management of the phenomenon - I will then come to the preventive measures to be taken in the forests - is that the first intervention is absolutely crucial. As the Minister for Civil Protection has openly stated, and the Deputy Minister for Civil Protection, if anyone looks at the sequence of events in the difficult days of this August, it will find that the great problem we have been called upon to manage, has unfortunately begun from the revival of the fire in Varube. The competent authorities were confident that this fire had been delimited, that at that time air was headed through to Evia, which was facing a very big problem, and obviously, when this fire was rekindled, for reasons that are still being investigated, we had to return air in the back of Evia and have to fight two very large fires at the same time. Of course, as I have told you, experience has shown that no matter how many cleanings we have, no matter how much air we have in it - and this year we have more than every other year - it is very difficult to prevent the expansion of a fire, especially in conditions such as the ones we have experienced, if it is not possible to erase it at the beginning. And if you see the fire in Barumbas, it proves exactly the truth. For the first time this year, within the royal estates - some are disturbed by this terminology, but that is what all citizens call them - in any case, within the core of Parnitha\'s forest, at least the southern part, there were systematic cleansing. For two months they worked in Tatoi logging from Halkidiki in order to remove branches and logs, which had fallen after ""Medea"", which had unfortunately done a great deal of damage to the ecosystem of Attica. As you may know, there are anti-nuclear zones in the area and even large anti-nuclear areas, which unfortunately have not been enough to stop the fire. Here the fire was unable to stop on the highway, where it was expected to be a hundred firearms, where the highway has a width of almost 100 meters. However, there have also been gaps in the prevention sector. And it is characteristic that, although for it this year, 51 million euros were allocated to municipalities and forests, the results were unfortunately not the expected results. That is why the responsibility now lies with civil protection under the \'DRYADS\' programme. Over a period of EUR 300 million will now be provided for cleaning and fire protection zones. These projects must be carried out in winter and spring, with the cooperation of forestologists and the support of local government. In the field of organisation, it is also noted that although more forest protection funds were provided, their absorption was not checked in the best way possible, as until the recent changes we made, forests and forestry services were subject to different political heads. With the act of legislative content, which we will shortly ratify in the National Parliament, we are making a significant structural change and, at last, I would say, the forests in the Ministry of the Environment under the responsibility of the Secretary-General and the Directorate-General for Forestry, so that there is a single supervisory centre that determines our forestry policy, that is to say that these are not simply and often uncontrolled to decentralised administrations, as has been the case so far. It is an important structural reform, which I believe will enhance the efficiency of the Forest Service as a whole and will enable us to work better with the Civil Protection, so that these two pillars, the Forest Service on the one hand and the Civil Protection on the other hand, can cooperate harmoniously during the fire suppression, but above all during the time when there are no fires, where important preventive intervention is needed in the forests. We have therefore seen that, yes, we need more air means and, in particular, air means, which are provided for by the Civil Protection Programme which has already been approved by the Ministerial Council before the catastrophic fires. We will invest in new aircraft, move quickly to quickly acquire and rent these aircraft in the short term. I referred to the so-called trawlers who were first tested and proved their effectiveness. Of course, we are going to set up a special unit which can now try more efficiently in the forests. This is a need, which has emerged strongly in recent days and has also been confirmed with the cooperation of Greek fire extinguishers, with foreign specialized colleagues, who have speeded up helping the country at this difficult time. This new unit, which will be made up of forestists and forest firefighters, should be better trained to act within the specific conditions of the forest. The truth is that the transfer of the power of forest protection and firefighting from the Forestry Services to the Firefighting became, Mrs Gennamas, in 1998 on PASOK governments. It took years to familiarize the firefighting with this new mission, as the firefighting was designed by its birth to face basic urban fires. Today, however, Greek firefighters are much more experienced, much more trained, much more trained to deal with forest fires. But they have to be even better. And we, too, have seen foreign forces, who have come to assist us, who have used new techniques, which are sometimes exploited by the fire brigade, and we need to learn from these fire brigades, which have the greatest potential and efficiency to attempt within the forest in relation to our own fire brigade. If we do not have to be fully prepared to manage our own House in the light of the next anti-nuclear period, I have no difficulty in coming together with foreign countries, so that for the next one or two years, the Greek forces can be framed with foreign forces, which can support us in the critical months of July and August in which the most forest fires occur in our country. Finally, I believe that we are all called upon to draw conclusions from the coexistence of forests and the built-up environment. Without bureaucracy in these mixed areas, residents will now be able to clean up their plots, their streets, without requiring all this extremely complex process where the Forestry license is needed to cut off any branch outside your plot. The flammable pine trees next to the houses, which have at least burned, in the surrounding areas of the settlements should be replaced by other trees. Obviously, I\'m not talking about all the pine trees, as a large part of the regeneration will be natural regeneration and obviously our pine forests, which are burned will become pine forest again. I am referring to this area of settlements where we need to move forward, and this is the direction I have given the Ministry of the Environment with special reafforestation plans, so that a zone can be created between the pine forest and the settlement in which we will have different kinds of trees much more fire-resistant. Our forests will be regenerated to a very large extent and artificial reafforestation will take place where they need and where experts point us out. Finally, settlements, as well as houses near or within the woodlands, should be subject to special firefighting specifications. And I have already instructed the relevant Secretary of State for the Environment to adopt the relevant ministerial decisions. Of course, we should also be concerned about their insurance policy in the future, as a whole, against natural disasters. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] All this is, of course, just a few initial findings. That is why I will again point out that my public apology was a personal, moral attitude, but before all, it was a political act with a message. Sorry is not only a recognition of responsibility, it is also a motto for action, it is a call to learn from a negative experience so that we can become better. With this starting point, then, a lot will change. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] Ladies and gentlemen, I now come to the third question, which we must answer, what we are doing at the moment to support our fellow citizens who have been hit by the catastrophic fires. A few days after the fire pass, we\'re already healing our wounds. In Attica, Evia, Fthiotida, Fokida, Peloponnese, on the initiative of the Ministry of Infrastructure, the damage has already been recorded. Two thousand four hundred ten three autopsies and rechecked in houses and business spaces. The arogi.gov.gr platform has so far been submitted with a thousand seven hundred thirty-five applications corresponding to 10.5 million euros of compensation. The Greek state has never moved faster in granting substantial compensation to the affected. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] I would like to remind you that for a fellow citizen who saw his home being destroyed, the first aid is up to 20,000 euros. At the same time, I would like to stress that anti-corrosion and flooding projects have already started everywhere, which I attach particular importance to. Already in the regions of Evia, which will be the most prone to flooding, mixed steps have been taken by the Ministry of the Environment, the forests responsible for flooding and anti-corrosion works within forests, the regions and municipalities so that as soon as possible the best possible flooding can be carried out, the many burnt trees can be removed, the corrosion, the corrosion grids with the help of all forest cooperatives so that we can contain the land, the natural regeneration, and at the same time limit the potential flooding phenomena. I would also like to stress that we are giving special attention to compensation for farms, for means of production, for plant and livestock. There will be specific actions in Evia for resin producers - Mr Koutsouba, I saw that you were at the relevant rally in Evia - but also for beekeepers. Especially for the resin producers, we are talking about almost a thousand of our fellow citizens living from the forest. We will also draw up in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour a multi-annual work programme - multiannual I mean up to seven years - so that we can allow these people to work in the woods at first stage in the restoration work, in the second phase in the protection of the forest, as this will begin to be reborn and corresponding forecasts will also be available for beekeepers. Of course, I must say that especially for the Northern Evia region, the measures we have announced concern not only those affected by the fire. There, as you know, a comprehensive plan for relocating from the housing and productive reconstruction to the new employment opportunities of the people is being drawn up so that they can stay in their homes. Also, a corresponding model of development projects to a lesser extent, because the damage is less, will follow Elias, which has been hit for the second time by destructive fires over a period of 15 years. I would like to stress that I attach great importance to the private donations, which will support this effort. For the first time through a transparent and easy process, via the website e-dorees.gov.gr, private, business, institutions will meet with the needs of the public and each donor will be able to monitor where his money is directed. With the new\'refreshing contractor\' institution, an interested private person, an institution, an enterprise will be able to undertake not only the study but also the rehabilitation works of an area, always under the supervision of the relevant forest office, and then assign it to the state. Such work has already begun and it is important that the assistance we have received from large institutions, from large businesses that have been inclined to strengthen this effort, which offers not only the resources but also the speed - I stress it, speedily - to the implementation of the projects concerned, which, obviously, is absolutely essential at this juncture. This afternoon I will have the opportunity to meet with the Commissioner himself responsible for crisis management, Mr Lenartsik, so that we can see how we can obtain additional European assistance. I would like to open up one parentheses and say that the contribution made by our country over the last few weeks has been really unprecedented. Twenty-three countries - twelve through the European Support Mechanism, but also eleven countries bilaterally - rushed to support our country by means of air, with fire extinguishers, with staff. I thank each of these countries separately, the volunteers, the volunteers, the firefighters who came to support us at this extremely difficult time for our country. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] Head of this reconstruction effort will be Mr Christos Triantopoulos, who has a great deal of experience in managing relevant state aid programmes. I would like to present, in the Minutes of the House, the account, from the government\'s actions, of support for the affected areas after the \'January\' disaster and after the catastrophic earthquake in Samos. And I would like to say to all our affected fellow citizens, who today with anger or even suspicion can face these announcements, that as we supported our fellow citizens in Karditsa and Samos and we did not leave them unprotected, we will now do so. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] [[At this point the President of the Government, Mr Kyriakos Mitsotakis, presents for the minutes the above mentioned documents, which are in the archives of the Secretariat Department of the Department of Stenography and Practice of the Parliament.]] Of course, I have commissioned the design of the next day of northern Evia to a man who is known to us, known to all of us, does not come from our own political space. I am referring to Stavros Beno, who has a great deal of experience following the catastrophic earthquakes in Kalamata. He is the man who designed the regeneration of this city, he is an active citizen who has one, I would say, very specific view of what means specifically integrated Special Spatial Plans, so that the challenges of one region can be treated holisticly and all the financial instruments directed towards policy axes which are one that is in harmony with the other. Mr. Benos will obviously be looking for the views of counterpopulation. And I can assure you that every good idea will be welcome to this effort. Especially for the reconstruction of northern Evia, this is a national effort. That is why it will, in fact, be a conquest for our country if all the political forces in these ambitious reconstruction programmes, as I have said, participated in these ambitious reconstruction programmes. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] In order to happen, however, this first and foremost takes into account the priorities and recognition of the truth, the answers to the questions I have been trying sincerely and today and also to all my public interventions to give, the questions that have arisen from the reasonable indignation of those who have been besieged by the fire, but often myths have become in the confusion and the insufficient image of the conditions, but also data which have unfortunately been distorted by the policy of organized excavations of the settlements. I said straight away - I told the interview I had given on 18 May - that our first priority was and remains the protection of human life! [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] I honestly cannot understand why there has been a conscious attempt to challenge this attempt, a challenge which directly affects the memory of victims of previous tragedies. Yes, houses and trees are re-engaging. It\'ll take time, it\'ll take a while, it\'ll take money. But people don\'t come back and it\'s the life that gives life to all! And this criticism does not even have operational power, because other forces are engaged in evacuation - above all the police, a part of the Civil Protection and the municipalities - and other forces - the Firefighting, the volunteers - give the same time the battle with the flames. This is not about rivals, it is about complementary functions. One helps the other. That is why, as I said, almost all the settlements which have been emptyd have been saved. Of course, let us not forget that the organised removal of residents is not limited to the warning of \'112\' at all times. It means specific local plans, which, as I have said, includes planned escape routes, animal care, blocking of roads so that there are no locking and, of course, the police, but also the port. I hope, therefore, and I hope that we will not hear this criticism again today, in this Chamber, because she is petty towards a collective conquest of the country, which, at least in this area, has brought us closer to far richer and organised states. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] \'112\' does not exist today - I imagine you will know it - either in Germany, France or the United Kingdom. In Germany today too, responsibilities are being sought and research is being done because there was no tool to warn citizens to evacuate their homes after the catastrophic floods. This government, like all of them, will at some point be gone and another one will come. But the conquest of 112 and the culture of evacuations is a reserve for the country. And I would sincerely ask you, at least, at this point not to criticise. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] Ladies and gentlemen, I will not speak in detail about the Civil Protection Programme, which has already been approved by the Ministerial Council of EUR 1.76 billion. It is the ""AEGEANIS"" programme. I am presenting only his brief presentation in the Minutes. [[At this point, the President of the Government, Mr Kyriakos Mitsotakis, presents for the minutes the above document, which is in the archives of the Secretariat Department of the Department of Stenography and Practice of the Parliament.]] I will just say that it is a coherent and comprehensive plan with guaranteed funding resources to get the country, at last, the civil protection it needs to have, taking into account the challenges of the climate crisis. This proposal takes into account scientific data and findings drawn up by the previous government. And I am referring, Mr Tsipras, to the Goldenmer conclusion which I have had the opportunity to reread very thoroughly. I must tell you that in many of his conclusions I agree with. Furthermore, I would like to remind you that since 2008 when I was chairman of the Committee on the Environment, following the catastrophic fires in Elias, we have raised some of the important problems with regard to the lack of prevention and the failure to cooperate properly between fire and forest services. I would ask you, however, only and I would like to ask you in general, when it calls for this finding not to be relied upon selectively, but to invoke it as a whole. For example, the finding itself acknowledges that there must be no display of air means. I guess you\'ve read it. But I have not seen your C.E. who has not supported the justified wrath of the inhabitants who, on every fire, want a helicopter over their village! Isn\'t that right? Here, then, we must be consistent with what we say. Yes, we need air means, we need specific air means, we need more air means, we know which air means we need and we will see to it from time to time to have rentals, and we will also launch air-market programmes. But it is wrong to tell citizens that a helicopter or an aeroplane can be available above every house or that the fires erase only from the air. Fires do not only fade out of the air, such as fires are not transmitted in conditions of intense winds. Because I also heard this criticism that the whole of Greece was burned with zero boars. But, do you not know, when exercising this criticism, that these large fires create their own microclimates and do you not read in Mr Goldmer\'s own report that 60% of the large fires develop in conditions of moderate winds? So let us agree, on some basic facts, to isolate good and documented criticism from easy extremisms which are often directed at angry, sad citizens who are afraid of being indignant at that time of tension, sad, angry. And because you\'re going to rush again, I imagine you and Mrs. Gennimata criticising the state, I\'m preventing you. It is the ultimate state of this government that has so far successfully responded to a number of parallel crises in Evros, in vaccination, secured the resources of the Recovery Fund, coordinated the government\'s work, proceeded to strengthen national defence! It is the ultimate state and the successes and failures of this government. [[Applause from the New Democracy wing]] But be careful, Mr Tsipras, ladies and gentlemen of the SYRIZA, the final state has always been. And once there was a state at last, we didn\'t find out. But there were other performances and yes, Mr Tsipras, there were other representatives. For example, today the final state is represented by Mr. Gerapitris, represented by Mr. Scortsos, represented by Mr. Pierracakis, who reminds you that he is a Minister of State with responsibility for digital transformation precisely to demonstrate the horizontal nature of this intervention. Previously, the final state was represented by Mr Flavouraris, Mr Pappas, Mr Vernardakis, and I think this debate is closed.', 'We want today and from this Step forward to express our solidarity and solidarity with all those who have lived through the fire nightmare, to all those who have seen their homes destroyed, their place, their lives. We\'re together in the fight to stand back on their feet, take their lives back. And the crucial thing is to support all those affected and finally to reinstate what the fire has destroyed, but it is so crucial that criminal responsibilities are not forgotten, that the causes be raised, how and why we have come to this point, that all the necessary conclusions are reached. You can ask for any apologies you want, invoke errors, omissions, promise that responsibilities will be attributed. But here we\'re not talking about another summer with big, multi-day fires. We are talking about a huge ecological disaster, the destruction of popular property. Over a million thousands of acres have become ashes along with houses and crops. This huge disaster is not due to some individual mistakes, some individual omissions. Besides, your ministers at the beginning of the anti-nuclear period assured all tons that an extremely pilot job has been supposedly done, a real cut this year, not only in terms of instruments, equipment but also staff. That\'s what they said. But the problem lies in the absence of integrated forest management and protection. In this context, too, there is a lack of a modern comprehensive anti-nuclear protection plan, focusing on prevention, specialising for each forest complex. Such an integrated scientific plan did not have either the Government of New Democracy or any previous government. Unless SYRIZA tells us that by leaving to the government drawers at least no such plan, rather than some fragmentary measures, that are moving on the ground. We have heard the climate crisis, unprecedented nature attack and so on. As if it takes a lot of brains to understand that this is more than always true and will be much more valid in the future. That is why a state, a government, for these negative scenarios, must prepare itself for such crises and problems. Unfortunately, however, your urban state and your government, precisely because they go with the interests of the few, with the interests of the groups and not the many, of the Greek people, do not take measures to protect the life, the property of the Greek people, because they consider them to be cost. Trained proof that not only are you not prepared, but you are already using the climate crisis as an excuse for covering your shortcomings, gaps, huge shortcomings. So tell us, Mr Mitsotakis and all of you who have made candy the climate crisis and you swear to the environment. Is it the climate crisis that gave Attica just 30,000 euros for forest roads this year? Is it the climate crisis that the average age of fire extinguishers is forty-five or fifty years old, depleted by huge movements and constant care? In Gerenia Ores you moved firefighters even from Evros. And then it\'s your fault of the climate crisis? We\'re not ashamed! As far as we are concerned, this year\'s major disasters were thirty years ago. For example, in 1988, thirty - three years ago, a million acres of forest and agricultural land were burned in our country. In 1999, twenty-two years ago, most of the fires have been recorded over the past twenty-five years. In 2000, twenty-one years ago, it was the greatest disaster. Burned 1.6 million acres. Same with the floods. In March 1987, thirty - four years ago, in the great floods, we had ten dead. In August 1990 another great flood drowned five people in central Greece and November 1992 a strong rain leveled Kavala, destroying 70% of its road network and killing four people. Then, of course, no one has yet been talking about climate change as the perfect alibi for all disasters. Even if we accept that these disasters were the first signs of climate change, what prevented you all of you, who have constantly ruled for more than thirty years now, to take measures, to adapt plans, to build up infrastructure to limit damage, to protect the people? The answer is one: the policy of supporting capitalist profits at the expense of people\'s needs and interests. The New Democracy Government has no doubt the first responsibility today, but all those who have ruled are in the bunker of responsibilities and not out of it. You\'ve all got your nest dirty. In time you have committed criminals against the people, against forests and the environment. What government, while forests accounted for 65% of our country\'s territory, gave more than 0.04% of the state budget for forests and their protection? What government has strengthened the forests so that they can meet the enormous needs of forest protection? The New Democracy since the 17.7m euros demanded by forests throughout the country for anti-nuclear armour projects has credited only 1.7m euros, which is only 10% of their needs. Here, too, SYRIZA again cannot be justified, because for his days, during the period 2016-2019, he gave even less. For the protection of the people against fires you do not have, you say, money, but to fund the Greek mission in Afghanistan for so many years you find 300 million a year. In fact, you were not even enough in the second place as Greece for naval spending. You have allocated EUR 6.6 billion to reach the top position. Which government has gone ahead with the abolition of the unscientific division of forest protection with the criminal, the murderous separation of prevention from fire-fighting? Nothin\'. You have all maintained this crime, which the people have been paying for over twenty years with great damage to forest wealth and human life. This unscientific separation, the separation of prevention from fire suppression is a key cause for the negative situation. Indeed, in services which have a different role and direction and are not coordinated in the same Ministry. This whole situation is, of course, dramatically exacerbated by seeing it in conjunction with zero funding and huge shortages in staff and resources. Not only did this scheme lead to a unity of instruments and actions, but it also led to a greater underfunding of all the services involved. The depreciation of total staff and resources. We see you, Mrs. Gennamas, coming out on the tiles. Well, I\'m sure someone\'s right to say. But you don\'t know anything about all this? You and your party, who has been ruling for so many years, have you not got any responsibility? And yet, this unscientific division of forest protection by separating prevention from repression was institutionalised on your day, in 1998, on the PASOK government with the Prime Minister of Simitis. Today many of those who supported this separation make their self-criticism, seeing the tragic results of this choice. You, gentlemen of KINAL, of the past PASOK, have you nothing to say about that? Which government was aiming at integrated forest management and protection? None. All of you are facing the forest as the field of an appalling capitalist development of profitability. All of you, with no exception, were building on each other with the laws for the rapid merchandise of the earth. Thus, the New Democracy has established the so-called \'new forest policy\', recognising the activities of monopolistic groups in forest ecosystems. SYRIZA as a government with a series of laws on grazing land, on settlements, called forest land. In fact, a law passed in 2017 by SYRIZA exempted large groups in the tourism sector from all the prohibitions of an arbitrary system. You have all taken the same dangerous path, overlooking integrated management, forest protection. This means a study of forest management, with interventions in vegetation composition, logging, forestry works, maintenance, improvement of infrastructure and networks. It means a modern study of anti-nuclear protection, including all measures, forestry, management, anti-nuclear, in accordance with the rules of science, which increase the forest\'s ability to face fire before it erupts. It means ensuring the conditions for implementation through brave funding, with recruitment of permanent staff, ensuring all the necessary means. What government has served adequately with the necessary permanent staff, with modern means, with infrastructure, the Fire Corps, which continues to operate with the philosophy and structure of the Security Corps, with what this implies for its own operation and its role? I don\'t want to say much. You\'re saying that yourself, for the seasonal fire extinguisher personnel who\'s old, for the extinguisher media that\'s outdated. I would just like to point out that no one intentionally points out, which relates to the weakening of their operational planning. Who is responsible for the fact that about a thousand firefighters are operating at the airports of FRAPORT, on the private roads, on the ""Eleftherios Venizelos"" from the day it was privatised? Why does none of you say a word about it? Obviously why you do not want so-called ""investors"" and the financial facilities you provide them to be targeted. Well, whatever you do, the center of criminal responsibilities has you all inside. Of course, the Government of New Democracy is causing upwards when it says that its main objective was to protect human life. There is no second thought, of course, that it is very important that we do not mourn human lives. It is a challenge, however, to invoke it by saying, in fact, that \'no whole settlement has been lost.\' What settlement are you talking about? This is where entire areas have been destroyed. An entire area, northern Evia, has disappeared. Have you gotten it? The fact that there were no victims or even that an entire settlement was not burned was due first of all to the self-determination, the self-sacrifice of the inhabitants, who along with the few firemen, fought a body with fires and managed to save their home, their lives, their villages. The hierarchy you\'re doing, and especially in this tragedy, to let the forest burn down in the name of life protection, has failed miserably, because they burned over a million acres of forests, crops, finals and houses, if you wait for the fire by the houses, you don\'t stop it. The forest fire can and must stop in the woods the first ten, fifteen minutes if you don\'t want to take uncontrollable proportions. The problem cannot be solved by air means. The main burden was to prevent and should be given to modern anti-nuclear design in the context of integrated forest management and protection and the organisation of ground forces for the first insult. You, instead of hiring and organising ground forces, instead of implementing them through the forest services - by recruiting staff, scientific, woodworker, to be used for projects in winter and summer in forest fires and others, by carrying out studies, management projects and fire protection - what are you doing? You only go further than that for the air that they need, but they are not the main instrument. These are mainly slowing down, slowing down evolution. The earthly powers, however, erase the forest fires. The scattered ground forces make the first insult to the forest, based on the specific anti-nuclear design. You flagged your evacuations, evacuations without a plan, without education, without a concentration infrastructure, without ensuring that all conditions are met. Where they happened, they became horizontal, without having secured an organised evacuation mechanism. Villages where in some cases you were sending people into flames by mistake, avoiding fatality precisely because people knew their place, villages, detonated the fires and did not die in the wrong orders. I was also a personal witness to such an event, in the course of a fire, which I made an intervention for it, about what he sent and what a message he gave. And yet, if anything you should have ensured after the tragedy in the Eye that was that. And not ""evacuate"", that is, ""Wait to be saved"". The responsibilities are therefore not being ignored. Your perseverance, in fact, before well - well - is extinguished, to have the debate over the next day, do not think it will relieve you of these responsibilities. On the contrary. The more you talk about the so-called green transition imposed by the climate crisis, the more you nail yourself. As you have been ready for some time to show as a unique way out the so-called green business, except that business on the burnt, only green is not. These are also about environmental protection reports for primary schoolchildren. And the so-called \'green\' development, which is naturally a pretext for the environment, is intended to make young children, the aim is to create greater profitability rates for some new investments in the green energy sector and in various other sectors of the economy. Everyone knows that the forest is the only social asset, the only natural resource that, through its operation, encapsulates carbon and produces oxygen, subject to its unique management and protection, in order to improve its supply. How hypocritical is your green sensitivity? How false is your interest in the supposed treatment of any climate change? There, in the large groups of so-called \'green\' development, the resources of the European Union\'s Recovery Fund will also be directed. It is no coincidence that both you of the government and you of the Opposition support the interventions for the Recovery Fund for the most famous green development. But when we talk about a Recovery Fund, we are talking about this new memorial, which the people will constantly pay, and transport and literally. Suffice it to think that, for each disbursement, anti-corruption measures should be introduced, such as your recent legislative monstrous regime that trespasses labour rights. And, as anyone can understand, the billion euro cobbler from the Fund will not go to public health, education, wages, pensions, the improvement of social services, will not go to projects of vital importance for the protection of the people against natural disasters, will not go to support for small businessmen, but to finance green business. We heard you say that your government wants and knows and can rebuild what the fires have broken, that your commitment is to regain what we have lost. This means that all the forest land that has been burnt, but without contractors, as you painted the big businessmen who will run their plans in the burned areas, must be immediately resurrected. It is necessary to ensure integrated forest management and protection. The subjection, in fact, of the Forest Service at the Ministry of Environment and Energy comes to link forests even further with harmful green investments in the energy sector. For the people\'s families who have been destroyed, \'to regain what we have lost and resurrect them\', as Mr Mitsotakis said, do you know what it means? Stay where they are, get back what\'s lost, home, work, income. This was said by the thousands of northern Evia residents on Saturday in the Strofykia hub, you mentioned, at a large gathering, but buried by the media. You are afraid, you are shaking the people\'s initiative, popular mobilisation and action, people\'s control, because you know that the popular wrath of these false words, the big ones will come out of you politically. They want their homes, their jobs, their forests, their jobs, their crops, their livelihoods, their income. This is what the people in Evia, Elias, Arcadia, Messinia, all of Attica and the other regions want. The measures that your Government has announced so far do not guarantee any of this. All that can somehow alleviate firefighting is compensation for 100% of damage, full recovery of the income lost and for as long as the consequences exist. For example, in northern Evia there are many farmers, farmers, retinas. All of these lived in direct or indirect dependence on the forest. Until this returns to the position which contributes to the production and the corresponding amount of resin, honey cannot be covered with the benefits, which have a specific time horizon. Also, how will olive oil yield within two or even four years, on the basis of what you say about the time when oilseed producers have lost olive groves of many years that cannot be replaced in immediate time? The allowance you\'re going to give them what he\'s going to cover in the first place? Is the fixed financial costs, the new costs added to a firefighting family for its survival, or what results in the creation, maintenance, construction of agricultural land, pastures and others? Where will these be covered? The cessation of payments for three years is a drop in the ocean. He cannot give a breath of relief to the firemen, who for the next few years must rebuild their lives from the beginning. What about these properties that have not been proven by your checks are completely destroyed, as you say, or have suffered functional damage? I mean, a farmer who has lost his income, but his home has not suffered any operational damage, will he continue to pay HIS VIA for that and with what income? Small self-employed professionals are on the air. In northern Evia, as in other regions, there are many sections that are active in tourism, foodism, as regions - and especially northern Evia - attracted too many tourists because of their natural wealth. How will these small businesses survive? By not returning the refundable payment? Did you forget that this money was given to support the consequences of the pandemic? Now, even if they manage to build their businesses, they have to deal with the new overall situation in the region, which is now a skull site, while the trade fee and insurance contributions are suspended for six months, as if after six months, companies will stop being affected. Let\'s not talk about the indemnity you have announced. There is no guarantee from anywhere yet who and how they will be taken. So who\'s considered to be firefighting and what are the criteria for how firefighting he is? Are they going into the damages undeclared or uninsured infrastructure, animals, other property? What about the second home disasters? The measure concerning workers, by giving them a suspension for the next period, is tossing them out of a large part of the workforce, since it does not count on those who work uninsured, those who solved the contract as soon as the fires started, those who did not start work on food, tourism because of the coronary pandemic. Do you really bear in mind the difficulties that have arisen in the tabling process and the supporting documents? Many are forced to resort to private accountants who cost enough. Not everyone has access to computers, nor do they know the supporting documents and others, and nothing has been announced about the exemption from excise duty on fuel, the abolition of fares on ferrobots and so on. PPC\'s announcement that gives the right to those affected not to pay the current account is for mocking. The residents, the professionals, the farmers in the region, need to have a guaranteed free electricity for the whole time that the full reconstruction of their homes, their businesses and so on. Many of the families, too, who have been affected, have children studying. It is required that the State receive a monthly student allowance, for example, to ensure free accommodation, food, travel, free internet, consumables, books. In short, nothing less can be tolerated by the rapid, direct and universal -100% - compensation for all pistols. And 100% compensation means that they will be compensated for everything and without any hindrance from the first animal, root, etc., whether it is secured, marked or not. It is the responsibility of the State to cover the cost of logging documents with full debt write-off to the State, to the banks, to the insurance companies of all residents. Especially for the retinas in northern Evia, it is necessary to ensure permanent work with a contract of employment, wages and rights of retinas for the afforestation, preservation of the forest. A total of permanent and adequate income measures are required for farmers, self-employed professionals and workers in each affected region. In all areas affected, extensive anti-corrosion measures of flood protection are needed immediately. We emit a hazard signal in front of autumn and winter, especially for Evia, which is burdened by previous natural disasters and phenomena. Go directly to all the necessary flooding measures so that we do not mourn lives. We are not enough with the general promises from the Step of the House. This cries out all the workers, the people, and Evia and everywhere, who each year burns and drowns, which every time he hears all promises without opposition. They are still waiting for compensation, infrastructure projects from previous disasters. And if you think that with the committees and the commissions you\'re making and suggesting both the Civic Anti-Civilisation and the various majestics, you\'ll fool them again, you\'re wrong. Experiment and knowledge now exist and it must make use of everyone so that the next day they can stand on their feet. Only in the last two years of the New Democracy to take into account will one see the strengthening of the arsenal of repression and authoritarianism towards the people rather than the strengthening of fire-fighting, forestry services and hospitals in the country with permanent staff. But we do not agree with the idea that when a fire takes place, they will be threatened and they will eventually become ashes, property, forests. We do not agree that when it rains we are flooding whole regions, our people will be at risk. We cannot compromise that in 2021 human life will remain unprotected. The huge steps of science can make a decisive contribution to the protection of the environment, to strengthening the integrated management and protection of forests against any danger, especially from forest fires and a whole range of natural wealth. Corresponding science\'s potential with the needs of workers can only be ensured by the JRC\'s realistic proposals. These proposals at the same time lead us to a path of economic and social development in our country, different from that which, at the same time, at its heart will be to ensure the well-being of people, to the protection of the lives of workers and the environment itself. This road opens today\'s claims, the action, the positions of those on the streets of the struggle through collective organisations of the movement with unity, organization, claiming, solidarity, so that no one is alone. On this road together, the JRC is walking, because only the people themselves can finally save the people. Thank you.']","<|system|>

Thank you. The senator's answer. Of course, there are two of the points we discuss today - really all but two. A senator noted in his speech - a problem created by men is caused by man. Poverty is another thing, climate change is the other. When the senator asked two questions together, I listened. I see what you're doing. A senator is saying, Mr. President, but I think we have to face it in our rich community that we have to do both. We need to eliminate poverty, and we too need to fight climate change. I just want to ask you what. A senator, Mr. President, whether I understood it correctly, that there is something other outlining the subject."", ""V.E.G. President. Thank you. A senator's answer is positive. Thank you. Similarly, a senator cooperates with each other in good shape. It's a legal committee. I'm going to draw out here on the increase in scope and government spending, that we're going to have to, looking for sustainable financial resources, to have more priorities for the future. We need to take what is called a reevaluation of expenses, this systematic analysis of expenses, a much closer way. It's right in front of us. I agree with what. A senator about that. Then I'll go somewhere else. Hv. A senator spoke of the carbon bill. It is distributed in different ways to jobs and to the country. Now we are promoting energy exchanges in transport, and there are, of course, positive developments in many ways and part of needed measures to deal with climate change and respect our parts in the Paris Convention. But how do you know? A senator envisions the inevitable changes that must be made at collections or tax collections in order to finance transportation? Hv. A senator spoke of a complete policy on that matter and that we might just fall from the carbon tax. But because of him. A senator speaks of a complete course, how does he picture all this collection? And how do we make transportation to the future?"", ""A respectable president. Thank you. A senator for the speech. True, I must admit that I did not fully understand the meaning. Hv. A senator spoke of the need for money in health matters as if it were just something to add money. Like all nations we compare with ourselves, we are trying to buy as much new drugs as possible, but all the nations we compare to are now limited to them for obvious reasons that I don't have time to go over now. He spoke of the road system, putting more money there, telecommunications, more money on them, the tourism, more money on it, the education, more money on them. Hv. After being held at the council, a senator should know that setting priorities, for example, for health care. This has been done during this terms, in contrast with what was done during the last terms, as all numbers show. All you can do is make a bill to check it out. I don't like to talk like it's only by itself that it's done. It is very difficult to deal with, and hopefully we will continue to do so. A respectable president. Hv. A senator does not want the housing aid we have to help people pay off debts, saying that he opposes them. So, what do you think? A senator says that we have long - term assistance that goes out of paying interest in people? It's just a grappling operation, that's actually helping with financial institutions rather than something else. It would be nice to have a point of view. It's for a senator. Also spoke whiskers. A senator in the debate of the fact that the political party he is in would want to stop with fossil fuels. I was very interested that Iceland should be the first country that wouldn't use it. Perhaps it would be nice to hear how we are going to do that, a respectable president.""]","<|system|>

41,214,41_fracking_gas_environmental_fossil,"['fracking', 'gas', 'environmental', 'fossil', 'water', 'ban', 'methane', 'energy', 'environment', 'emissions']","['fracking', 'gas', 'environmental', 'fossil', 'water', 'ban', 'methane', 'energy', 'environment', 'emissions']","['I want to address most of my remarks to new clause 12 and fracking, but before I turn to that specifically, I want to put on record my concerns about flooding, because we are in a climate and ecological emergency and we are seeing increased instances of flooding. I have certainly witnessed that in my Lancaster and Fleetwood constituency, and it concerns me that at the same time the Environment Agency budget has been cut by a third and the fire and rescue service by a fifth. It is simply not enough to wring our hands while making these cuts, when we cannot respond to the flooding emergency, so I urge the Minister to look again at these cuts and at investing in upland water management The Environment Bill is the Government’s first opportunity to bring in equivalent standards to those in the EU regulations, so, frankly, if we cannot secure strong environmental protections in this Bill, it certainly bodes ill for securing workers’ rights and workplace protections. New clause 12 would revoke current fracking licences and prevent the Oil and Gas Authority from being able to provide future licences for hydraulic fracturing, exploration or acidification. Fracking is a big deal in Lancashire. When Cuadrilla started, in just two months 57 earthquakes were detected. Cuadrilla stopped fracking five times because it triggered earthquakes bigger than the Government rules allowed. Even more disturbingly, a year later, an earthquake measuring 2.9 on the Richter scale led to a review by the Oil and Gas Authority, which, worryingly, concluded that it was not possible to predict the probability or size of the tremors caused by fracking My Lancashire constituents and, indeed, much of the country were relieved when the Government got around to launching a moratorium halting fracking and exploration with immediate effect, but in the past two years the Government have failed to deliver the legislation that is needed to give effect to their promise. If the Minister is not willing to support new clause 12 today, when will that come? It was a relief that the Government got as far as the moratorium almost two years ago, but we need something concrete—something solid—behind that. If the Minister is to assure my constituents that the Bill is not just empty words, will she accept Labour’s new clause and legislate to ban fracking once and for all We know from the Lancashire experiment on fracking that it is a risky way of extracting dirty energy. We have seen that France, Germany, Ireland, Bulgaria, New York state and the Netherlands, as well as Scotland and Wales, all agree, so this is our opportunity to bring England into line. There are so many risks surrounding fracking, and the Government know that or they would not have called the moratorium in the first place. The British Geological Survey is very clear: “Groundwater may be potentially contaminated by extraction of shale gas” In England, groundwater supplies a third of our drinking water. In addition, the assertion that fracking will lead to a jobs boom is simply not true. Cuadrilla’s application in Lancashire talked about starting just 11 jobs, and that is before we start looking at the jobs that would be put at risk by fracking happening on the Lancashire coast, because so many of our jobs on the Fylde coast are in the tourism industry, and people are not keen to holiday next to fracking wells Most importantly, scientists agree that if we are to avoid dangerous levels of global warming, fossil fuels need to stay in the ground. With every application comes huge environmental concern. There is a risk of additional carbon emissions, as well as the understandable anxiety for local people about the impact of earth tremors and water contamination. When will the Minister listen and finally take action? Now is our chance, once and for all, to tell the fracking companies that time’s up, and to put the future of our planet and our communities first.', 'I thank the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, for initiating this debate on fracking. It concerns the important question of the nature of the UK’s future energy mix and whether fracking has an acceptable role to play. The continuing debate and your Lordships’ contributions tonight are serious matters. I commiserate with the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, should he consider that being positioned between stages of the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill does not do justice to the importance of this subject, but tonight’s debate has been excellent. I thank all noble Lords who have contributed at this important juncture in our deliberations on the UK’s future role in Europe. I am disappointed that the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, has been noticeably absent tonight, but I am pleased to see his conversion to a more critical stance in his contribution to the Journal of Energy Security, in which he calls for a change of direction in fracking policy and says that the view coming from Ministers is much too optimistic. I agree, despite some of the contributions tonight Labour recognises the dominance of gas in the UK’s energy supply and the concerns for the nation’s security of supply while the UK transforms into a low-carbon economy. While the Government are coming forward with every assistance to further the role of fracking as a game-changer, we have some critical questions from a different, more realistic perspective. Is it likely to be the game-changer? Is it safe, and are there special places like national parks that need special protection? Is it wanted and recognised as really needed? Is it really a low-carbon bridge to a sustainable future I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Featherstone, for her recognition tonight that maybe this debate does not reflect widely held, less assertive views. The debate has recognised some issues between the competing views on this question. It has been mostly positive towards fracking and, as the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, has said, has largely regretted that progress, even towards the exploratory drilling stage, has been slow, suggesting that speed is certainly to be welcomed. However, Labour has always been sceptical about fracking’s supposed benefits. The geology and geography of the UK are different from those of the United States. Theoretical reserves are not the same as recoverable reserves. At present the evidence points to the likelihood of rather disappointingly low recovery rates of shale gas from wells, with rapid depletion and the need to establish large numbers of wells and pads in concentrated areas of the country that are not largely unpopulated, all to extract even a modest amount of gas for the UK’s energy system. Shale gas is unlikely to be able to replace the returns from conventional natural gas as they diminish. The exploratory evidence has yet to be produced to support the estimates from the British Geological Survey Labour has never believed that the returns on fracking are likely to be so compelling as to allow the overriding of legitimate concerns about the process on safety, environmental and community grounds. This debate has underlined that fracking should only proceed on the basis of clear and rigorous environmental safeguards. Furthermore, there should be an outright ban on fracking in and under areas of environmental sensitivity such as national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, sites of special scientific interest and water protection zones. These areas need better protection even than the added requirement that fracking be limited to depths below 1,200 metres The Government’s environmental conditions do not measure up to Labour’s standards, achieved during the passage of the Infrastructure Act, which were subsequently reduced by the coalition Government in 2015. Environmental tests should include an understanding of the number of well-heads being set up and the cumulative effects to which the numbers might give rise, over and above those of fracking taking place at all I certainly enjoyed the contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Mair, who gave us the perspective of his society’s 2012 report. He emphasised the importance of the integrity of regulatory enforcement. However, having a world-class regulatory regime is not enough. Regulatory bodies need to engage with local communities that are concerned about the potential impact in their area, as they have heard has happened elsewhere. Their legitimate concerns should not be overridden. Local communities need to be convinced that community benefits and the sharing of future revenues are not to be interpreted as a way to buy off objections for particular ulterior motives The position now is that most of the conditions that Labour laid down, and particularly those concerning the cumulative impact of multiple fracking pads on an area, have either been disregarded or weakened to such an extent that they no longer constitute credible environmental safeguards. The development of fracking exploration and production cannot be endorsed under these circumstances. It is not safe or reasonable to proceed without these key safeguards. Labour is now calling for the introduction of a moratorium on fracking in the UK until such time as we can be sure that full environmental safeguards can be observed Finally, there are concerns that shale gas is also a fossil fuel and that fracking is incompatible with our climate targets. The chief scientist at the then Department of Energy and Climate Change, Professor David MacKay, and Dr Timothy Stone concluded in a report that shale gas production would give rise to greenhouse gas emissions. They argued, however, that with the “right safeguards”, these would be “relatively small”—“comparable” to liquefied natural gas and well below the emissions of coal The noble Lord, Lord Smith, gave a thorough assessment of the relativities of the various fuel sources in the UK, but this interpretation is not supported by the Committee on Climate Change, the independent statutory body set up to provide advice and analysis to government and to report to Parliament. It concluded that the implications of shale gas for greenhouse gas emissions are indeed uncertain. By the time any shale gas exploitation would have developed on a significant scale, the UK carbon budget would have reached more advanced and critical levels. Shale gas is only likely to become permissible once tests relating to emissions, gas consumption and carbon reductions elsewhere in the economy have been satisfied. The UK should not be developing shale gas any further at this time.', ""Thank you very much. In Levica, we will, as proponents of the proposed Law on Amendments and Supplements to the Mining Act, which prohibits fracking, of course, support. The first reason is that fracking is by no means in the public interest nor in Prekmurje, nor in the inhabitants of Petišov, nor in the inhabitants of Slovenia. Fracking in Petišovci is in the interest of only and only investors in the British corporation, which would there at the expense of the environment, people, nature make profits with fracking. Throughout the world, as we have already heard in the positions of my predecessors, fracking is banned: in 2011 it was banned in France, in 2016 it was banned in Ireland, in 2019 it was adopted in the United Kingdom by a complete moratorium on the implementation of fracking, in 2016 it was banned in Germany for commercial purposes, and in 2012 it was banned in Bulgaria. Why is that? It's no secret. The most famous disasters, environmental disasters by polluting drinking water and so on, are on the other side of the Atlantic, in the United States of America, where this mainly causes hydraulic fracturing, but also the finding of hydrocarbons in shale, such as in Petisovci, leaves irreparable environmental consequences. The most famous example of this type of cracking on the sandstone, on the same stone basis as we have in Petisocves, is the Groningen gas field in the Netherlands, where fracking has caused more and more frequent earthquakes, which have left serious consequences on the buildings in the field. On the basis of evidence of earthquakes, damage to buildings of the local population and fracking, the Dutch Government, in 2018, ordered more than 200 companies producing gas in the Groningen field to stop pumping within four years. First off, fracking causes earthquakes. It's the other way around. Fracking pollutes local water. During the cracking process, a mixture of water and chemicals is injected into the deep well to release the gas. However, the mixture of chemicals used in this process may contain naphthalene, formaldehyde and a number of other volatile organic compounds, and therefore there is a high risk of contamination of drinking water and surrounding water sources in fracking. Fracking also affects the air. Fracking produces refugee emissions that may contain methane, volatile organic compounds, gasoline, tuloin, H2S, which, of course, means that both the environment and the health of the surrounding population are polluted. After all, fracking has a negative impact on the local environment and the landscape, causes erosion and sedimentation, increased risk to aquatic ecosystems due to potential spillage and spillage of chemicals, fragmentation of habitats, loss of coastal areas and reduction of available surface and water levels due to the reduction of local groundwaters. These are all the reasons why fracking is banned all over the world, and it is quite amazing that Slovenia would become a country in 2021 that would allow proven harmful technology in Petišovci, and this is not in any public interest or in the national interest – as we have heard many times before, to obtain domestic reserves of natural gas and so on. I would like to stress that the cracking in Petišovci will be carried out by the British corporation and the interest to carry out this project is only in the hands of its investors, and we will all remain, at the expense of the local population; those who will be put at risk of water pollution, to degrade the environment, to eventually pollute the thermal water around it. We hope, both in Levica and in the fifth place, that this time in the National Assembly, we will have the sense to ban this situation definitively before the elections.

I welcome the debate to range over the revised draft airports National Policy Statement and the issues it raises I agree with the analysis of the importance of aviation to the UK economy and the need for new airport capacity. Heathrow is the busiest two-runway airport in the world. While declaring my support for Heathrow expansion, subject to safeguards, I am mindful of the perspective of London Luton Airport—a major contributor to aviation provision in the south-east—which is also reaching capacity as currently configured. I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I divert to another airport from time to time. I draw attention to my interest in the register as an advisory member of the board of London Luton Airport, a council company that owns the airport assets By way of history, Luton Airport was originally run as a committee of Luton Borough Council but was required to transfer its undertaking into a separate company by the Airports Act 1986—the handiwork, I believe, of the noble Lord, Lord Spicer. This was at the same time as the British Airports Authority was required to restructure into a main holding company with seven separate operating companies: Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton. Along the way, the Scottish airports were privatised and the BAA, which subsequently had to divest itself of Gatwick, Stansted and Edinburgh, was sold to Ferrovial London Luton—progressively known as Luton International and then London Luton Airport—travelled a different path to ownership and development from most airports when Luton Council entered into a public-private partnership through its wholly owned company with a third-party consortium. The airport has, perhaps unusually, enjoyed considerable support from its local community. Indeed, a local election was lost by the party which sought to privatise the airport, for a derisory sum, and which has never since—at least so far—regained control of the council In common with much else we debate at present, we should be mindful of the impact of Brexit on aviation and therefore airports policy. The liberalisation of air transport, with the ability of carriers to fly wholly within and wholly between other EU states and between a base and any other EU airports, has had a significant beneficial effect, added to by the advent of low-cost, short-haul flights across Europe and the growth of such airlines as easyJet and Ryanair There is clearly an imperative for the Government to negotiate continuing access to this liberalised regime on one basis or another, ranging from staying in the European common aviation area, a UK open skies deal with Europe or a single bilateral agreement with the EU. The issues of access to airspace and the implications for airfares, as well as safety regulation, also need to be resolved. Assuming that Brexit becomes a reality, we would argue strongly for our staying in the European common aviation area and remaining in the European Aviation Safety Agency. My initial questions to the Minister are: what progress is being made on all of this and what are the expected outcomes; and to what extent have these issues—or any of them—been taken into account in passenger number predictions, especially for Heathrow We should recognise that Conservative policy on the expansion of Heathrow has flip-flopped in recent times. Before the 2010 general election the party was opposed to a third runway and a sixth terminal at Heathrow. Its 2010 manifesto referred to stopping the third runway and linking Heathrow directly to the high-speed rail network. The coalition Government talked of cancelling the third runway at Heathrow, and the owners of Heathrow announced that they would abandon plans for a third runway. However, concerned lobbying persuaded the Government to look again, thankfully, hence the long-grass device of the Airports Commission Initially, the Government announced that they accepted the case put by the commission for more capacity in the south-east but had not decided where. Eventually, on 25 October 2016, after being pressed by constant questioning in Parliament—noble Lords will remember those exchanges in this House—the Secretary of State announced that the Government would support a third runway at Heathrow and bring forward a draft NPS. All in all, this is a disgraceful example of how the vital infrastructure needs of our country should not be handled. Political considerations were to the fore, as capacity at our most important airport was squeezed. The commission eventually unanimously recommended a new north-west runway at Heathrow combined with a significant package of measures to address environmental concerns. In making this decision, it gave weight to economic and employment benefits, as we heard: long-haul flights and connections; domestic connectivity; lower fares; surface access links; and support for freight. I support the strength of the position it has taken The consultation process at various stages has become a bit convoluted. In February 2017 the Government produced a draft airport National Policy Statement for a 16-week consultation. However, following their commitment to update their evidence base on airport capacity and their air quality plan, they then produced a revised draft airports National Policy Statement for yet further consultation. This sits along a range of other documents, including the Aviation Policy Framework and UK airspace policy. The Government have also announced the setting up of an Independent Commission on Civil Aviation Noise Can the Minister tell us where these further consultations leave the timetable for expansion at Heathrow and whether they expect any further adjustments to the NPS because of data changes? When might we expect the final airports National Policy Statement to be laid before Parliament, and will it be subject to a vote in both Houses? I think the answer already given to that is yes. Can the Minister summarise for us the key differences in those two consultation outcomes So far as the airports policy framework is concerned, it is important that we recognise that there is no one-size-fits-all and that the unique position of each airport is considered on its merits. Indeed, that is what the NPS does fairly. It is also important that the DfT understands the need to support the growth plans of other airports in the period before a new runway at Heathrow is delivered and that it recognises the contribution that these can make to capacity requirements —I speak particularly of London Luton Airport. I believe we can be reassured that Luton’s plans—which I will outline—are consistent with the development of Heathrow, but is this the view of the DfT and the Government London Luton Airport plays a vital role in the local and sub-regional economies, as well as contributing to the national aviation strategy. It is the fifth-busiest and one of the fastest-growing airports in the UK, and estimated to provide 22,000 jobs and £1.4 billion to local GDP by 2030. It plays a different role and serves different markets from Heathrow in the aviation sector. Its expansion can develop runway capacity and meet the specific needs of its catchment area—which of course includes London—for short-haul, point-to-point journeys. It supports the government aviation strategy in agreeing that more intensive use can be made of existing airport capacity, alongside the provision of a new runway at Heathrow. It looks to the Government to support its ambition At present, its passenger capacity planning permission is set at 18 million passengers per year from 2014, which was expected to be sufficient to meet demand through to 2026-27. There is a £160-million redevelopment programme to create this capacity. However, that capacity is expected to be fully utilised by 2020-21, so the focus is now on looking to maximise use of the existing runway and to maximise the benefit for the local and sub-regional economy, consistent always with managing the environmental impacts in a responsible and sustainable way. The assessment is a possible capacity of 36 to 38 MPPA, or 240,000 aircraft movements per year, with no new runway In their call for evidence on its aviation strategy the Government acknowledged the importance of surface access to airports and the need to link road, rail and air. A new £220-million fixed-rail link between Luton Airport Parkway—funded by Luton Borough Council—and the airport terminal will be a significant improvement on the current bus link. But transport links could be improved if the DfT were to stipulate that four fast trains per hour should call at Luton Airport Parkway as part of the base specification for the new east midlands rail franchise. Consultants have analysed that this would add minimal time to the semi-fast Nottingham services each hour, take some 70,000 car journeys off the road and save some 500 tonnes of CO2. It would create an integrated transport hub as conceived in the NPS and the aviation strategy. I am aware that this matter has been raised before, and perhaps the Minister can tell us whether any progress has been made We readily recognise the importance of the aviation sector in our economy, which directly supports some 230,000 jobs and contributes £20 billion per year. We further recognise that the opportunity to deliver the potential for the sector is being affected by capacity constraints at some airports, and Heathrow is the premier example. The Minister will be aware of the controversy engendered by the Government’s upping of the expected contribution of an expanded Heathrow to £74 billion over the 60-year period, and that the NPS shows this below the contribution which could come from Gatwick expansion over the longer term. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that point Decisions to expand airports properly involve delicate assessments of the environmental and community impacts of new build, especially runways. That is why my party has rightly laid out the four tests to be met for Heathrow, covering: how the increased capacity will be met; the need to reduce CO2 emissions from aircraft to help us meet our legal climate change obligations; the effective management of noise and environmental impacts; and the need for the benefits of expansion to be shared. As part of the appraisal of sustainability for the north-west runway scheme, it is noted that there are a range of mitigating or supporting measures, which the Minister mentioned, to enhance the positives and mitigate the negative impacts of a proposal. There is reference to the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, but there is little detail other than that the promoter has put forward a number of commitments, which the Government expect to be honoured. This is a bit thin. Perhaps the Minister can say more in his reply. He dealt with the issue of a package to address the problems of noise There is a need to make progress at Heathrow as it heads for full capacity. There is also the need to press ahead with expansion at Luton as it approaches the current 18 mppa planning constraint.', 'My Lords, it falls to me as co-pilot to land this debate, which had a smooth take-off with my noble friend Lady Chisholm at the controls. I hope to land on schedule. During the flight, we had in the cockpit two qualified pilots, two former Transport Ministers and a number of aviation experts. All said that they had been on this flight before several times and were used to being stacked for long periods. The journey was smooth, but with some turbulence as we flew over Richmond and Moulsecoomb, and there was a request to divert to Luton This has been an excellent debate, and I welcome the informed scrutiny that this House has, as usual, provided. I will try to answer the many questions raised; if I cannot, I will write. As I said, the speakers have been well qualified. For my part, I was Secretary of State for Transport for two years, with responsibility for airport policy, but my recollection is that I was constrained from articulating it for fear of prejudicing the inquiry into Terminal 5, which was under way at the time. At the time, I was Member of Parliament for Ealing Acton, so the future of Heathrow has always been an interest that has generated concern: concern about noise from some constituents but, I must say, counterbalanced by the employment generated for others, either those directly working at Heathrow or those working for businesses whose success depended on proximity to Heathrow. I suspect that there is that same tension in many other parts of west and south-west London There is a wide range of views on this subject. That is why we have undertaken one of the largest consultations ever and were keen to ensure that all the consultations were full and fair, giving everyone an opportunity to have their say. In response to the final point made by the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, I hope that that engagement with the community will continue as we move to the next stage in the planning process I was asked about consultation by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. I should like to write to him about the timings, but we are carefully considering the responses to the consultations—both the one under way and the separate one undertaken by Heathrow. We do not expect any further contributions to the Government’s consultation, but that is dependent on our analysis of consultation responses. We anticipate a debate in both Houses ahead of the Summer Recess, and the Government are committed to a vote in the other place The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, asked me about the EU safety agencies, which is an important issue. We want to explore with the EU the terms on which the UK could remain part of the EU agencies that he mentions, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency The process of parliamentary review that we are participating in is a vast improvement on the years of public inquiry into the need for schemes that bogged down infrastructure before the Planning Act was introduced, and I shall say a word about that in a moment. My noble friends Lord Spicer and Lord Naseby made it clear at the outset that we have delayed far too long in resolving the calls for additional runway capacity in the south-east. The Government are anxious to bring this decades-long debate to a satisfactory conclusion. The revised aviation passenger demand forecasts show the need for additional capacity in the south-east is even greater than previously thought The opportunities and challenges that Brexit brings only strengthen the need for investment to improve links with the rest of the world. Across the economy our national infrastructure needs modernisation. That is why we are pressing ahead with the delivery of HS2, rail investment, broadband, road schemes, energy infrastructure and this proposal for a 3.5 kilometre additional runway. The noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, asked me whether anything less than that would invalidate the NPS, and the answer is, yes, it would The noble Lord also asked under what powers the Secretary of State could acquire the properties he referred to. The answer is that the Planning Act 2008 enables compulsory purchase, but the draft NPS rightly holds Heathrow to its public commitment to provide 125% of unblighted market value for the homes of those subject to compulsory purchase The Government are clear that they expect the number of domestic airports with connections to Heathrow to increase. Heathrow Airport Limited has set out a number of pledges to help strengthen existing routes and deliver new routes to the regions and nations of the UK. These include discounted charges for domestic passengers. Air routes in the first instance are a commercial decision for airlines and are not in the gift of an airport operator. The aviation strategy—I will say a word about that in a moment—will consider the level of connectivity our nations and regions require to support economic growth, whether the market is able to provide this and what the role is for Government support There was a lot of interest in surface access and who pays for what. Heathrow is already well connected, with links to the M4 and M25, access to the Tube via the Piccadilly Line, and rail services from Paddington. In addition, later in 2018 Crossrail services will start to the airport, replacing the existing two-train-per-hour Heathrow Connect service. From December 2019, six Crossrail trains per hour will run from the airport directly to central London. TfL plans to upgrade the Piccadilly Line with new trains, more capacity and a faster, more frequent service. From 2026, HS2 will connect to the airport via an interchange at Old Oak Common, providing an express route to the Midlands and the north. A western rail link is planned to allow passengers to travel directly to the airport from Reading and Slough. The scheme is currently being designed in detail before seeking its own planning powers. Building is underway to upgrade the M4 to a smart motorway between junctions 3 and 12 to provide additional capacity As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport has said, we can see great potential in a southern rail connection to the airport, which would enable journeys via Woking, Waterloo and Clapham Junction. That would be of great benefit to those coming up from the south-west. We have already had initial approaches from a number of would-be private sector promoters that are interested in developing this On the question of Transport for London, we do not agree that airport expansion would require £15 billion to £20 billion of new infrastructure improvements on top of the billions we are already investing in improved transport. TfL’s number includes a range of other projects in London, which may or may not be needed in the future to deal with general population growth unrelated to airport expansion. The revised draft airports NPS sets out targets for the public transport modal share of journeys made to and from the airport by both passengers and staff HAL has pledged to meet the costs of any surface access proposals that are essential to deliver airport expansion. This would include works on the M25, A4 and A3044, as well as a contribution to the cost of the rail schemes. The plans for the runway to cross the M25 would be subject to the proper planning process and would be designed to minimise disruption to other users during construction On the question of the Government’s contribution, which was raised by a number of noble Lords, the Government would only consider contributing to surface access costs where they were not needed purely for airport expansion and they benefited non-airport users, as may be the case for the proposed western and southern rail access schemes, for example. The CAA will decide how the costs of any capacity-related surface access schemes will be treated as part of the regulatory settlement, including which of these costs would be recoverable from airport users Moving on to some of the other issues, the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, asked about car parking. Heathrow is currently consulting on its proposed plans. Any application for development consent must include details of how the applicant will increase the proportion of journeys made to the airport by public transport, walking and cycling to achieve a public transport modal share of at least 50% by 2030 and at least 55% by 2040 The noble Baroness also raised an issue regarding the Environmental Audit Committee. By ending the sale of conventional new diesel and petrol cars and vans from 2040, the UK is going further than almost every other European nation. Air pollution has improved significantly since 2010, but we recognise that there is more to do, which is why we have a £3.5 billion plan to reduce harmful emissions. We will carefully consider the Joint Committee’s report and respond in due course Environmental and health impacts were again mentioned by a number of noble Lords. The Government take account of the WHO guidelines in developing policy. It is important to note that they refer to noise from all sources, not just aviation. The draft airports NPS makes clear that the Government would expect noise mitigation measures to limit, and where possible reduce, the impact of aircraft noise compared to the 2013 baseline assessed by the Airports Commission. The details around the operation of any scheduled night flight ban, including the exact timings, would be determined at a later stage in consultation with local communities and relevant stakeholders, in line with the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s balanced approach to noise management. I will ensure that they take on board the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, on behalf of those who live in and around Richmond It is the Government’s view, based on expert analysis, that the Heathrow north-west runway scheme can be delivered in compliance with legal air quality obligations, with a suitable package of policy and mitigation measures. To answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, and to be absolutely clear, expansion will be allowed to go ahead at Heathrow only if it can be delivered within air quality obligations I turn to the impact of noise for those living underneath the flight paths. Airspace modernisation will give the opportunity to make the most of quieter modern aircraft, referred to by my noble friend Lord Naseby, and will also provide more predictable periods of relief from noise, as well as reducing the need for stacking. The CAA has introduced a new and more rigorous process from 2 January this year. Looking ahead, the design of new flight paths is technical and can take some time. Again, I will ensure that the comments made in this debate are taken on board On the question of benefits and economics raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, the Heathrow north-west runway is expected to deliver the greatest benefits to the UK economy, because it will deliver the largest increase in connectivity, particularly long-haul flights. This gives UK firms the opportunity to access markets around the world. International transfer passengers make this connectivity increase possible by supplementing local demand to make more flights viable. More flights means more capacity to carry goods to markets around the world. Details around the operation of the night flights ban will, as I said a moment ago, be determined at a later stage in close consultation with local communities. Once a ban is in place, compliance with the rules will be mandatory and not discretionary On the question of costs raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, and the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, the revised draft airports NPS requires the promoter to demonstrate that the scheme is cost efficient and sustainable, and seeks to minimise costs to airlines, passengers and freight owners over its lifetime. The Government have set out a clear expectation for HAL to work with airlines and the CAA to drive down the costs for the benefit of passengers, with the aim of keeping landing charges as close as possible to current levels. Beyond landing charges, the increased competition between airlines operating at the airport is expected to result in lower ticket prices for passengers HAL has already identified options for expansion, which it says have the potential to reduce the overall cost of expansion by £2.5 billion. On deliverability—or whether or not this can be done—Heathrow Airport is privately owned and any expansion will be privately financed and must be delivered without hitting passengers in the pocket. The Airports Commission concluded that the north-west runway scheme at Heathrow was commercially viable and financeable without government support, including where an additional 10% capital expenditure was required. The Government have considered this analysis and are content that the scheme is viable On the other points made by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, we are aware of the alternative proposals for expansion at Heathrow which he mentioned. We would encourage any third parties to engage with the economic regulator, the CAA and HAL with a view to reaching a possible commercial agreement. He also touched on the broader issue of the aviation strategy, looking beyond Heathrow. Our new aviation strategy will indeed look beyond the current debate on a new runway at Heathrow. It will set out an ambitious long-term vision for the sector which will support economic growth across the whole of the UK. It will consider how we can make best use of existing capacity at all airports around the country, including Luton, looking at any future need for new capacity away from Heathrow while tackling environmental impacts Going through the hundreds of pages of briefing that I was generously given, I was struck by one reply from Caroline Low, who gave evidence to the Transport Select Committee on 4 December last year. It concisely explains the reasons for the Government’s preference: “In terms of maintaining a global hub, regional connectivity, the number of flights and destinations, and passenger benefits, where Heathrow sits in the country it comes out every time on top” The Government are still considering the responses they have received and parliamentary scrutiny is ongoing. We will take on board all the comments made during this debate, and I will write to any noble Lord whose queries I have not answered.', 'With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about airport policy Last year, the independent Airports Commission delivered its final report under the chairmanship of Sir Howard Davies. I would like to pay tribute to the quality and professionalism of the commission’s work and express my thanks to all its members. The commission concluded that we need more capacity in the south-east and put forward three viable options for expansion. It unanimously agreed that the proposed north-west runway at Heathrow presented the strongest case. In December, my predecessor came to the House to announce that the Government accepted the commission’s assessment of the need for additional capacity, but made clear that further work was required before a decision could be made on the location of a new runway. That work is now complete This is a momentous step for our country. The decisions taken earlier today, which I shall outline in a moment, are long overdue, but they will serve our country for generations to come. I know that some Members have strong convictions on this issue and that everyone in this House will understand the significance of this announcement for jobs; an economy that works for everyone; passengers; the global importance of our country; the environment; and people affected by expansion. It also sends a very clear message that this country is open for business It is not an easy issue or a simple process. I make no apologies for the fact that we have taken time to get it right, but today also shows that this is a Government who are unafraid to take difficult decisions and get on with the job. Before I outline the decision that the Government have reached, I want to explain how today’s announcement fits within the planning process and the opportunities that Members will have to contribute In the new year, we will bring forward a draft national policy statement, which will include the details of the proposed scheme. As required under legislation, it will be subject to a full and extensive public consultation, followed by a period of parliamentary scrutiny. Only once Members have voted on the final national policy statement and it has been designated will the airport be able to make a detailed planning application Strong connections with global partners and the ability to trade with new and growing markets are vital to securing Britain’s place in the world. The UK currently has the third largest aviation network in the world—second only to the United States and China—contributing more than £22 billion to UK GDP. We have the second largest aerospace manufacturing sector, which generates annual exports of £26 billion. Our aviation industry supports almost 1 million jobs and invests £1.7 billion every year in research and development. Last year, UK airports handled more than 250 million passengers—up 5% on 2014—and 2.3 million tonnes of freight Heathrow is the busiest two-runway airport in the world, and Gatwick the busiest single-runway airport. Indeed, the London system will be almost entirely full by 2030, with the exception of a small amount of capacity at Luton, and that will be taken up soon afterwards. If we do nothing, the cost to our nation will be significant, amounting to more than £20 billion over 60 years through delays, fewer flights and passengers having to fly from airports elsewhere. In addition, the wider impacts on our economy will be in the region of £30 billion to £45 billion. That is why the decision we have reached today is so important to the future of our country, not just to tackle the immediate shortage of airport capacity, but to set our country on a course to even greater prosperity for future generations I have spent a considerable amount of time this summer visiting the different schemes, talking to their promoters, and assessing their strengths and weaknesses. I have been genuinely impressed by the quality of choice available to us and the detailed work that has been put into the three plans. Any one of them would bring benefits to our country. At the end of its work, however, the Airports Commission made a clear and unanimous recommendation to the Government—that we should accept the proposal to build a new north-west runway at Heathrow, subject to a package of measures to make expansion more acceptable to the airport’s local community. Since the publication of that recommendation, my Department has studied in detail not only the report, but new and supplementary information that has emerged about the different options since The commission’s report and the subsequent information formed the basis of the discussion that took place this morning at the Cabinet Sub-Committee. As a result of that discussion, the Government have decided to accept the recommendation. We believe that the expansion of Heathrow airport and the north-west runway scheme, in combination with a significant package of supporting measures on the scale recommended by the Airports Commission, offers the greatest benefit to passengers and business, and will help us to deliver the broadest possible benefit to the whole United Kingdom. That approach will deliver the greatest economic and strategic benefits for our economy. It will strengthen connectivity for passengers right across the United Kingdom. It offers a major boost to freight operators. It can be delivered within carbon and air quality limits and, crucially, it comes with world-leading measures to limit the impacts on those living nearby In addition to the benefits identified by the commission, the scheme will deliver the connectivity and hub capacity that the UK needs to compete with fast-growing European and middle eastern hubs. The airport’s location means it is more accessible to business and the rest of the United Kingdom by both road and rail. Access to Heathrow is more resilient, and it is better placed as the national freight hub. Ultimately, the proposal will bring the largest benefit to passengers and the wider economy: up to £61 billion over 60 years. But we are not alone in this view. UK airlines and businesses are also clear that Heathrow is the right place to expand Before I continue, I would like to pay genuine tribute to the promoters of the other two schemes considered by the Sub-Committee. As I have said, both presented well-developed and compelling cases for new capacity. In particular, I would like to place on record the fact that Gatwick, despite not being selected today, remains a key part of our national transport picture and will continue to do so in the future I want to be clear that expansion will not be at any cost to local people, to passengers or to industry. We have to make three assurances. The first is about making Heathrow a better neighbour. We must tackle air quality and noise, and meet our obligations on carbon both during and after construction. Air quality is a significant national health issue that the Government take immensely seriously. That was why we undertook further work, which confirms the commission’s original conclusion that a new runway at Heathrow is deliverable within air quality limits. We remain committed to ensuring that that remains the case. The airport has already committed to industry-leading measures to mitigate air quality impacts. Furthermore, the Government will grant development consent only if we remain satisfied that a new runway will not impact on the UK’s compliance with its air quality obligations The broader issue of air quality is something that the Government take very seriously, and the updated evidence base shows clearly that the biggest challenge we face is not the expansion of an airport, but the levels of emissions in urban areas more generally. That is the very reason for our national air quality plan. As part of our ongoing work on air quality, my Department has embarked on a joint project with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Treasury to identify further ways in which we can tackle the issue. By the time a new runway opens in the next decade, we intend to have made substantial progress on tackling such air quality challenges across our nation as a whole On the issue of noise, no airport can be silent, but technology is making aircraft quieter. The new generation of aircraft coming into service have a noise footprint that is typically 50% smaller on departure, and at least 30% smaller on arrival, than that of the aircraft they are replacing. Although planes are getting quieter, however, they still have an impact, which is why we will expect a six-and-a-half hour ban on scheduled flights each night to be a requirement for development consent. That would also see the airport held to clear and legally enforceable noise performance targets. Even with expansion, therefore, fewer people will be affected by aircraft noise than is the case today. We also recognise the importance of providing local residents with a clear, predictable timetable of respite from aircraft noise. That is something local communities value, and we will ensure that it continues once a new runway is built I recognise that the decision will have a big impact on people who live close to Heathrow, which is why we have insisted on a world-class package of supporting measures. Communities affected by the decision will be supported by up to £2.6 billion towards compensation, noise insulation for homes and schools, improvements to public facilities and other measures. For those whose homes need to be bought to make way for the new runway, Heathrow plans to pay 25% above the full market value of those homes and to cover all costs, including stamp duty, moving and legal fees. That offer is significantly above the statutory requirement. In addition, I can announce the creation of a community compensation fund. Local authorities will benefit from our policy of local retention of business rates The second assurance is on costs for airlines and passengers. A new runway will bring in new capacity to meet demand and allow for greater levels of competition, which will lower fares relative to no expansion, even after the costs of construction are taken into account. This is an investment in our country’s future. It will deliver major economic and strategic benefits to the UK, but they must be delivered without hitting passengers in the pocket. The Airports Commission has made it clear that that is achievable, as has the Civil Aviation Authority. It is important to send the message that this is not expansion at any cost, but the right scheme at the right price. I expect the industry to work together to drive down costs for the benefit of passengers. As the regulator, the CAA will have a vital part to play in achieving that and ensuring that new capacity fosters competition. Its aim should be to deliver a plan for expansion that keeps landing charges close to current levels, and I have full confidence in its ability to do so The third assurance is about how the expanded airport will benefit the whole of the UK, not just by creating jobs across the airport’s UK-wide supply chain, but by giving even more of the UK access to important international markets by strengthening existing domestic links and developing new connections to regions that are not currently served. The airport expects to add six more domestic routes across the UK by 2030, bringing the total to 14. That will strengthen existing links to nations and regions such as Northern Ireland, Scotland and the north of England, and allow the development of new connections to regions such as the south-west I am determined that Heathrow will meet those pledges and that the Government will hold the airport to account on them. Furthermore, the Government will take all necessary steps, including, where appropriate, ring-fencing a suitable proportion of new slots for domestic routes through public service obligations to enhance connectivity within the United Kingdom. It is important to stress that this is a decision in the national interest; it is not just about the south-east of England A new runway will strengthen the aviation sector across the whole nation, but we need to do even more. Our airspace is out of date. Modernising it will boost the sector and help to further reduce noise and carbon emissions. We will soon introduce proposals to support improvements to the airspace and to manage noise, which will include a consideration of the way in which affected communities can be engaged and whether there is a role for a new independent aviation noise body such as the commission recommended Let me turn to what happens next. There have been recent suggestions in the media that the process has been slowed down or somehow delayed. In fact, the opposite is true. Members will remember the saga of the planning process behind terminal 5, which took years to resolve. Following that, the national policy statement process, which was created by the previous Labour Government in the Planning Act 2008 and improved through the Localism Act 2011, was designed to speed up major projects, but in an open and fair manner. By setting out now why we believe that there is a need for new runway capacity, along with the supporting evidence, we will fulfil our legal obligations to consult the public and allow Members to vote on the proposal before it becomes national policy. That is what the law requires. That means that Heathrow will be able to submit a planning application safe in the knowledge that the high-level arguments have been settled and will not be reopened Today, the Government have reached a view on their preferred scheme, and the national policy statement that we will publish in the new year will set out in more detail why we believe it is the right one for the UK. It will also set out in more detail the conditions we wish to place on the development, including the supporting measures I outlined. We want to make sure that we have considered all the evidence and heard the voices of all those who might be affected and, of course, of those who will benefit. The consultation will start in the new year, and I can announce today that I have appointed Sir Jeremy Sullivan, the former Senior President of Tribunals, to oversee the consultation process. This is an independent role, and Sir Jeremy will be responsible for holding the Government to account and for ensuring that best practice is upheld The issue of runway capacity in the south-east has challenged successive Administrations for decades. There are strong feelings both for and against a third runway at Heathrow. This is not the scheme that was previously promoted in 2009. It does much more to mitigate environmental impacts, to compensate communities and to distribute benefits across the nation. This is an issue of vital national interest that touches every part of our United Kingdom. It is vital to the economic prosperity and global status of our nation, and I commend this statement to the House.']","<|system|>

It is disappointing that we heard very little that was new, or that was not pre-announced. It is frustrating that Parliament seems to be a sideshow when it comes to the Government making important decisions Moving on to the content of the Budget, a test for the Budget is whether it makes life easier or harder for businesses and families across the UK, and whether it takes the steps necessary to tackle the increase in the cost of living which we all know families in our constituencies face. The Chancellor’s choices today will shape how well children can learn; who goes to bed hungry; and how our businesses, which have been on the frontline, can not just survive but can be equipped and prepared for the future It is a shame that the Chancellor seems to have chosen a tax cut for bankers that is bigger than the extra funding that he is providing for children to catch up. Even that as a total is a third of what was recommended by the Government tsar. That was not a random figure of £15 billion picked out from a hat; it was based on research and evidence, and on understanding what children across the country needed to get through and catch up because of what they faced and how they were held back during the pandemic. They must continue to be at the front of our minds in this House This winter, the country faces a cost of living crisis of historic proportions. Fuel shortages, rising energy prices, the Government’s supply chain crisis and price inflation have hit families across the UK. A recent survey by 38 Degrees in Feltham and Heston found that 90% of respondents were concerned about their current supply of critical food and goods. Sixty-four per cent. of respondents had observed insufficient stock in their supermarket. The price of fruit and vegetables is up, and half of respondents had seen a rise in their energy bills. In the past few weeks, the Office for National Statistics has reported that 8 million Britons have been unable to buy essential food items, while grocery prices are reported to be 1.7% higher than last year These changes cannot be denied, and they have been compounded by the Government’s cruel decision—and it was cruel—to cut universal credit for six million families this winter, taking £20 a week from the pockets of families at time when prices are rising. In Feltham and Heston, 18,000 households are worse off as a result of the cut. £18 million has been cut from our local economy. Where was the £20 for universal credit going? It was not going into offshore tax havens; it was being spent by families, on families, in our businesses, in our communities and on our high streets. Returning what appears to be £2 billion through changes to the tapering of universal credit is welcome, and is an important step, but it does not go far enough. It will support some people, but not all, and there will still be millions of families who, just by trying to get through, will end up going into debt, with all the consequent problems that that brings. The Chancellor knows that, food banks know it, and the citizens advice bureau knows it. Everyone who looks at families’ income and the impact of the universal credit cut knows it I am glad that the Government have at least taken the advice of the Low Pay Commission to increase the minimum wage. I welcome this, but it needs to go further, and to a minimum of £10; good employers such as Morrisons have already increased wages to a minimum of £10 for all their employees. Many families are still going to struggle, however, even before taking into account the likely rise in gas and electricity prices next year, but there are no measures today to assist householders with rising domestic gas and electricity bills Meanwhile, many businesses are approaching what should be their most profitable period of the year yet are in great danger of insolvency, faced with huge debts from the pandemic, soaring energy bills, rising prices, empty shelves and growing shortages. Analysis based on the Office for National Statistics business survey suggests that over 300,000 new businesses, employing some 800,000 people, are at risk of closure in the next few months, yet the Government’s response has been to hit businesses with a new jobs tax as well as weakening their industrial strategy, and to take little more than piecemeal steps to resolve a supply chain crisis made worse by inaction and the lack of forward planning This crisis has hit British businesses and families harder than those in other countries. Almost 50 high street shops per day closed in the first six months of this year. Without further targeted action the face of our high streets and communities will be changed beyond recognition. Although today’s changes to business rates are welcome and a step in the right direction, as the Chancellor knows these reforms are in part a response to the stand Labour has taken The current business rate system in England is not fit for purpose. It punishes investment and entrepreneurship and hits the high street. Some of the incremental changes announced today, adopting calls for change from the British Retail Consortium, the CBI and others, are the steps that we need to incentivise rather than disincentivise investment, but there is no proper plan for sustained reform and rebuilding our high streets and economy. UK Hospitality has previously said that the biggest cost danger in sight for the sector was the reintroduction of business rates from 2022 Today’s moves are welcome but also highlight why Labour called on the Government to freeze the business rates multiplier and extend the threshold for small business rates relief. This can be paid for by increasing the sales tax, levelling the playing field between online and bricks and mortar businesses, but this is an area where the Government have inexplicably been dragging their feet. Why, on page 144 of the Red Book, do they say they will “continue to explore the arguments for and against a UK-wide OST” and “publish a consultation shortly”? This has been going on for a long time; this is not a new issue. The inequity between online and bricks and mortar businesses is impacting on the prosperity of those on the frontline in our communities, who have served our communities and who have served our country through the pandemic. They are being penalised for being in our communities rather than moving their services online. Reducing the cost burdens so many of our businesses face is essential if they are to survive and grow that necessary employment for the future If this Government were genuinely supporting entrepreneurship, I would have liked to see more about that in the Budget, and it would be helpful for the Government to be clear about whether they are still targeting the new enterprise allowance for cuts. Latest statistics show that since its launch in 2011, 268,000 start-ups have been initiated by 249,000 individuals. Those businesses reportedly range from plastering, gardening and removal services to website design, film making and architecture enterprises; they are businesses that are at the heart of our communities and that go on to employ others. This scheme has been supported by the Prince’s Trust and others that do amazing and important work in supporting enterprise and entrepreneurial skills for young people. This is the kind of culture and opportunity we should be looking to enhance; it should be integral, not an add-on. In the work we have been doing in Hounslow, I have consistently been surprised—positively and pleasantly surprised—by how many young people want the skills and opportunities to start their own businesses, and how many people who may lose their jobs want support to do something different and to achieve a dream or grow a passion. Yet we seem to make it harder, not easier I grew up in a small business in our community in Hounslow. I have been self-employed. I have an MBA. I have worked in the private sector and the public sector. I know what innovation and entrepreneurship is. I know what it takes; I know the sacrifices that those who are self-employed—those who start up and bear the risk —make. I know what they do In the last year, I have co-chaired the development of the west London innovation district, looking to use innovation and create opportunities for research and investment to enable our local aviation hub to become a worldwide Silicon Valley for aviation, working with all parts of our national and international aviation supply chains to take advantage of opportunities in technology and to drive jet zero outcomes. We are working with West London Business and our research institutions— Brunel University, Imperial College and others—because we recognise that a place-based response to innovation is what drives sustainable growth. Part of that is bringing entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs into the overall growth programme and having an integrated strategy that helps to deliver that I want the UK to be the best place to start and grow a business. We should be improving and upgrading measures such as the new enterprise allowance, as opposed to pulling the rug out from under the feet of new community-based entrepreneurs—not just those in the City but those in the heart of our communities, who deserve opportunities at grassroots level With a week to go until COP26, the Government have also failed to match their climate change rhetoric with action, as shown by the Climate Change Committee predictions that the Government are on course to miss future carbon budgets. A recent British Chambers of Commerce survey found that just 11% of small and medium-sized enterprises are aware of how to measure their carbon footprint How much of the increased R&D investment, which is so critical to supporting innovative businesses at the cutting edge of the new economy, is going to support small businesses on their transition to net zero, and how is that going to be enabled? How are these announcements going to be delivered and translated to outcomes on the ground that make a difference in the recovery of local communities such as Hounslow—being an aviation community, we were hit very hard by the covid slowdown—with tremendous green growth ambitions I cannot see in this Budget the step change in vocational and technical skills that we need, or the less bureaucratic apprenticeship system. I am sure that hon. Members across the House will have seen this in their constituencies, but in north-west London, for example, millions in apprenticeship levy money has gone unspent. It is a scandal that that has been carrying on for years. The Government have been told about it, but we need structural reform to the apprenticeship levy to make it easier to create opportunities for skills to be grown for the future. We need businesses to be able to find the skilled workers that they need, and we need our local communities to have access to those opportunities so that they are equipped for the jobs of the future I, too, want an optimistic Budget—we all want an optimistic view for our country—but why did today’s Budget not make a clear, unequivocal commitment, with clear messages about our direction, such as Labour’s call to invest £28 billion every year until 2030 to tackle the climate crisis so that we can protect the planet and secure jobs in the UK? Businesses want to be certain about our vision and direction. They want a clear view of where they should invest. They want to know that if they make an investment today, they will get a return on it in five years’ time, and that there will not be another sudden change of strategy. The Chancellor has been talking to businesses; he will have heard the same message that I have Let me mention a few other areas of concern before I close. As co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on mortgage prisoners, I find it disappointing that there is nothing in the Budget to help the 250,000 mortgage prisoners trapped paying high interest rates. The Government sold many of them off to mortgage loan sharks, which are charging them hundreds of thousands of pounds extra a year. That is more than seven months after the Chancellor promised Martin Lewis that the Government were looking for workable solutions. Markets are now expecting rises in interest rates, which will have a devastating impact on the finances of mortgage prisoners. The Government need to make sure that all mortgage prisoners can access reasonable fixed rates, so they get a fair deal and are protected against interest rates rises On building safety and cladding, I want to make just a brief mention of the challenges leaseholders are facing in blocks below 18 metres. I am not the only MP who is hearing about this from their constituents and the anxiety it is causing families week after week, day after day, with the uncertainty of how the safety measures and remediations will be funded. There needed to be more on that in the Budget and the Government need to tackle the issue urgently On children and youth facilities, I must say that I take issue with the portrait of Sure Start centres painted by right hon. Member for South Northamptonshire (Dame Andrea Leadsom). Her experience was not the same as mine. Our Sure Start centres did exactly what she described: they were family hubs, they gave advice and they supported early education. They supported language and literacy for those who were one or two years old. They supported new parents and they brought families together. I pay tribute to Noveen Phillips and others who ran the Bedfont Sure Start centre, which was forced to close as funding ran out. Those cuts affected over 500 Sure Start centres across the country, with children paying the price. On youth services—', 'This is a Budget that puts security first. It is a Budget that recognises the hard work and the sacrifice of the British people over the past five years and says that we will not put that at risk; we have a job to do and we are here to get on with it. This will be a Budget for working people—a Budget that sets out a plan for Britain for the next five years to keep moving us from a low wage, high tax, high welfare economy to the higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare country we intend to create This is the new settlement. From a one nation Government, this is a one nation Budget that takes the necessary steps and follows a sensible path for the benefit of the whole of the United Kingdom. This is a Conservative Budget that can be delivered only because the British people trusted us to finish the job, because they know that the only way to have a strong NHS, strong schools and a strong defence is to build a strong economy. That is how we were elected, and that is exactly what we are now going to do The British economy that I report on today is fundamentally stronger than it was five years ago. We are growing faster than any other major advanced economy. Our businesses have created 2 million more jobs. Living standards are rising strongly. Our long-term economic plan is working. But the greatest mistake this country could make would be to think all our problems are solved. We have only to look at the crisis unfolding in Greece as I speak to realise that, if a country is not in control of its borrowing, the borrowing takes control of the country. Britain still spends too much; it borrows too much, and our weak productivity shows that we do not train enough, build enough or invest enough. This we are determined to change. We will be bold in transforming education, bold in reforming welfare, bold in delivering infrastructure and bold in building the northern powerhouse. We will be bold in backing the aspirations of working people. This is a big Budget for a country with big ambitions. It is a Budget that sets the way to secure Britain’s future Let me turn to the latest forecasts from our independent Office for Budget Responsibility. We thank Robert Chote and his colleagues for their hard work. We now have Budgets that fit the economic forecasts, instead of economic forecasts that were fixed to fit the Budget. At the March Budget, it was thought that the British economy had grown by 2.6% last year. We now know that it grew by 3%. But the global economic risks are rising. The US economy has slowed, so too has China, and even before the Greek crisis intensified this week, the forecasts for global growth had been revised down this year to 3.2%. It is all the more reason to get our own house in order For 2015, the OBR forecasts growth at 2.4%. That is faster than America, faster than Germany and twice as fast as France. For the second year in a row, Britain is expected to have the strongest economic growth of any major advanced economy in the world. In 2016, the OBR has growth unchanged at 2.3%, and then it is revised up to 2.4% in the following year—a level of strong, steady growth that it predicts for the rest of the decade. This growth is driven by stronger private consumption, and by stronger private investment, too. Indeed, business investment is now 31.9% higher than it was in 2010, and is revised up again this year. Now we need to see investment at home matched by exports abroad. Our decision to become a founder member of the new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is driven by our determination to connect Britain to the fastest-growing parts of the world, and our decision to seek reform to the EU is driven by our determination that this part of the world shall not price itself out of a prosperous future Higher investment leads to more jobs, which brings me to the OBR forecasts for employment. Over 2 million more people have the security of work as a result of this Government’s long-term economic plan. The OBR forecasts that under the current economic conditions, almost 1 million more jobs will be created over the next five years. Our ambition is to go further, and create 2 million more jobs on the road to full employment. To help achieve that progressive goal, we set out today how we will make work pay Jobs are not created by accident. They are created when businesses have confidence—the confidence to invest, to grow and to hire; confidence that comes because Britain is getting its house in order. So we seek to create a country that can truly pay its way. The budget deficit is now less than half the 10% we inherited, and economic security is returning, but all that progress is at risk if we do not finish the job. That means more than just eliminating the deficit; it means running a surplus to get our dangerously high levels of debt down That brings me to the first of the key judgments in this Budget—how fast do we cut the deficit? My answer is this: we should cut the deficit at the same pace as we did in the last Parliament. We should not go faster; we should not go slower. At this pace, the national debt is lower as a share of our national income in every future year than when I presented the Budget in March, and it is achieved without a rollercoaster ride in public spending This is why: first, our tax receipts are stronger than forecast, showing that the recovery is firmly entrenched; secondly, as a strong majority Government, we have been able to get on with making extra savings in this financial year; and thirdly, we can make faster progress in returning our banks, including RBS, to where they belong—the private sector. Indeed, the sale of Government assets this year will deliver the largest privatisation proceeds of all time, higher than the previous record in 1987. With stronger tax receipts, more asset sales and a strong Government who are getting on with the job, we can achieve a smoother path to the same destination, with a surplus a year later in 2019-20, but the national debt lower and that same surplus higher. For this is a Budget that puts economic security first. Many difficult but necessary decisions are required to save money, and this will be done with moderation but determination. This is a one nation Government who do the best thing for the economy and the right thing for the country. This plan is reflected in the forecasts for debt and deficit produced today by the Office for Budget Responsibility. The deficit was 10.2% of national income in 2010. This year, it is forecast to fall to 3.7%—one third of the deficit we inherited. It then falls again to 2.2% in 2016-17, down to 1.2% the year after, and then to just 0.3% in 2018-19. The following year, 2019-20, we move into a budget surplus at 0.4%, which is then maintained the year after at 0.5% of GDP. In structural terms, the OBR judges that this will be the largest surplus in at least 40 years—Britain back in the black, and in its strongest position for almost half a century This is, of course, all reflected in the amount of cash Britain has to borrow each year. In 2010, Britain was borrowing a staggering and unsustainable £153 billion a year. In March, the OBR forecast that we would borrow less than half of that, or £75.3 billion, this year. In this Budget, it has revised borrowing down this year to £69.5 billion. Borrowing then falls to £43.1 billion next year, £24.3 billion in 2017-18, and down to just £6.4 billion the year after. In 2019-20, we move into a surplus higher than previously forecast of £10 billion, which rises to £11.6 billion the year after—Britain finally doing the responsible thing and raising more money than it spends Five years ago, we inherited a situation in which our national debt as a share of our national income was soaring. This year, that national debt share is falling, bringing to an end the longest continued rise in our national debt since the 17th century. It is falling now, and it continues to fall in every year of the forecast, down from 80.3% this year to 79.1% next year, then down again to 77.2% in 2017-18, 74.7% the year after, and 71.5% the year after that, before falling again to 68.5% in 2020-21. Britain has turned a corner and left the age of irresponsibility behind Having come this far, there can be no turning back. We should aim for a new settlement across the political spectrum where it is accepted that, without sound public finances, there is no economic security for working people; those who suffer when Governments run unsustainable deficits are not the richest, but the poorest; and therefore in normal economic times Governments should run an overall budget surplus, so that our country is better prepared for whatever storms lie ahead. In short, we should always fix the roof while the sun is shining Today, I publish the new fiscal charter that commits our country to that path of budget responsibility. While we move from deficit to surplus, this charter commits us to keeping debt falling as a share of GDP each and every year and to achieving that budget surplus by 2019-20. Thereafter, Governments will be required to maintain that surplus in normal times—in other words, when there is not a recession or a marked slowdown Only when the OBR judges that we have real GDP growth of less than 1% a year, as measured on a rolling four-quarter basis, will that surplus no longer be required. The Chancellor of the day will have to set out their plan with clear targets to restore the nation’s finances to health and the House of Commons will test the credibility of that plan and vote on those targets. This is sensible, pragmatic and keeps Britain secure. We will put the new fiscal charter to a vote in this House this autumn, and I invite broad cross-party support for it To meet the new charter, further difficult decisions need to be taken to live within our means. We will take these decisions in a balanced and fair way. I can confirm that the analysis produced today shows that the richest are paying a greater share of tax than they were at the start of the last Parliament. And more than that, we are continuing to devote a greater share of state support to the most vulnerable. As I said they would, those with the broadest shoulders are bearing the greatest burden, for we are all in this together. And in the last fortnight we have seen independent statistics showing that since 2010 child poverty is down, and so is inequality. That comes on top of a record number of women in work, and the gender pay gap at an all-time low—all good news that should be welcomed on both sides of the House The fiscal plan set out in the Budget requires around £37 billion of further consolidation over the Parliament. Today, I set out how we will find just under half of that—£17 billion. We have found annual savings of £12 billion from welfare and £5 billion from tackling tax evasion, avoidance and planning and imbalances in the tax system. The other half will largely come from Government Departments through savings and cuts and will be set out at the spending review that the Chief Secretary and I will conduct this autumn. However, no year will see cuts as deep as those required in 2011-12 and 2012-13 Of course, I am conscious that a huge amount has already been done to increase efficiency across Whitehall, with administrative budgets down by more than 40% in real terms, but there is still much more we can do. There is also a simple trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services. I know that there has already been a period of pay restraint, but we said last autumn that we would need to find commensurate savings in this Parliament, so to ensure that we have public services we can afford, and to protect more jobs, we will continue recent public sector pay awards with a rise of 1% per year for the next four years Public spending should reflect public priorities and we have to make choices. Our priority is the national health service. We will fund fully the plan the NHS has itself produced for its future, the Stevens plan. That plan requires very challenging efficiency savings across the health service, which must be found, but it also requires additional Government funding. Our balanced approach means that I can today confirm that the NHS will receive, in addition to the £2 billion we have already provided this year, a further £8 billion. That is £10 billion more a year in real terms by 2020. It is proof that you can only have a strong seven-day NHS if you have a strong economy, and it is proof that the NHS is only truly safe in Conservative hands I have set out the difficult choices we are going to face on Government spending and the priority we will accord to our national health service. I turn now to combating tax evasion, avoidance and aggressive tax planning. In Budget after Budget, we have done more to combat that than any Government before us. We inherited a system where bankers boasted of paying lower tax rates than their cleaners and some multinationals shifted all their profits offshore. We have stopped these blatant abuses that were allowed to flourish, and many others, but we promised the British people we would do more and find a further £5 billion a year, and I can confirm we have done so We are boosting HMRC’s capacity, with three quarters of a billion pounds of investment to go after tax fraud, offshore trusts and the businesses of the hidden economy, tripling the number of wealthy evaders it pursues for prosecution and raising £7.2 billion in extra tax We are going to change the law to stop the use of losses that abuse our controlled foreign companies regime, and make sure investment fund managers pay the full capital gains tax rate on their carried interest We will stop corporates artificially increasing the value of stock for tax purposes, and to focus the employment allowance on employment we are restricting it so that companies where the director is the sole employee will no longer be able to claim We are consulting today on how to deal with the increasing abuse of the rules around disguised employment when working through a personal service company, and we are going to add tough new penalties to our general anti-abuse rule and name and shame serial users of failed avoidance schemes. These people should have nowhere to hide The non-domicile tax status is a long-standing feature of the UK tax system—in place since 1914—that plays an important role in allowing those from abroad to contribute to our economy before returning to their permanent home, and many countries have some version of this tax status Simply abolishing it altogether would, as Ed Balls correctly noted, probably cost the country money. Many of these people make a considerable contribution to our public life and to tax revenues, but there are some fundamental unfairnesses in the non-dom regime that I am putting a stop to today It is not fair that people who are born in the UK to parents who are domiciled here can later in life claim to be non-doms and live here. It is not fair that non-doms with residential property here in the UK can put it in an offshore company and avoid inheritance tax. From now on they will pay the same tax as everyone else. Most fundamentally, it is not fair that people live in this country for very long periods of their lives benefit from our public services and yet operate under different tax rules from everyone else Non-dom status was meant to be temporary, but it became permanent for some people. Not any longer. I am today abolishing permanent non-dom tax status. Anyone resident in the UK for more than 15 of the past 20 years will now pay full British taxes on all worldwide income and gains. We will consult to get the detail right. All these non-dom measures will come into effect in April 2017 and they will raise £1.5 billion in extra tax for the Exchequer over this Parliament. British people should pay British taxes in Britain, and now they will Turning to corporate tax rules, we will also broaden the base for corporation tax by removing, for future transactions only, the annual deduction for acquired reputational value. For big companies with profits over £20 million a year, we will bring forward corporation tax payment dates so that tax is paid closer to the point at which profits are earned. That is fair and more in line with what we are doing in personal tax, and it is what almost all other G7 nations do. Banks make a key contribution to our economy, but they also need to make a fair contribution. It is important that they help pay down the debts built up during the banking crisis, but equally important that they go on creating jobs, not just in London but in Edinburgh, Leeds, Birmingham, Bournemouth and across the country. The new remit I am issuing today for the Financial Policy Committee highlights the importance of productive investment, innovation and competition in finance Our bank levy was introduced to raise revenue and increase the stability of balance sheets, and it has worked, but now it risks doing harm unless we change it. So I will, over the next six years, gradually reduce the bank levy rate, and after that make sure it no longer applies to worldwide balance sheets. But to maintain a fair contribution from the banks, I will introduce a new 8% surcharge on bank profits from 1 January next year. By getting this balance right, it means we will actually raise more money from the banks this Parliament, but at the same time make our country a more competitive place to do business We have also taken action to make sure that consumers get a better deal from another important industry: insurance. The costs of premiums are down for families, and today we are announcing a major review of the regulation of claims management companies and we will cap the charges they can apply to their customers Britain’s insurance premium tax is well below tax rates in many other countries. I am therefore today raising insurance premium tax, which applies to only one fifth of all premiums, to 9.5%, effective from this November. With these measures I am putting in place an approach for taxing banks and insurers over this Parliament which is sustainable, stable and fair In each year, we have been able to use money from the banking fines paid by those who represent the worst of values to support those in uniform who demonstrate the best of British values. Today we announce funding for the Defence Medical Welfare Service and the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League. We are supporting the incredibly courageous members of our special forces who are injured, and, in the 75th anniversary of the Victoria Cross and George Cross Association, quadrupling the annual annuity we pay to those who demonstrated the highest valour and whom I had the honour of meeting yesterday In the week of the poignant anniversary of the 7/7 attacks, we should recognise, too, that our victims of terrorism overseas have no permanent memorial. We will now fund one, as well as a specific memorial to those murdered in Tunisia. We are committing £50 million to expand the number of cadet units in our state schools to 500, prioritising schools in less affluent areas, and we are going to support the Children’s Air Ambulance by funding an extra helicopter In every Budget, I also find an opportunity to fund the commemoration of famous events from our history and the buildings that symbolise them. This Budget is no exception. The RAF’s group fighter command centre in west London was the place where the battle of Britain was directed from and it badly needs repair. I want to thank the new Member my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson) for bringing to my attention the dilapidated state of his campaign bunker. Let its renovation stand as a monument to the heroes of the battle of Britain and the days when aeroplanes flew freely over the skies of west London I turn now to the great economic challenge we face on productivity, for this is the key to delivering the financial security that families see when living standards rise. And it will ensure that Britain becomes what we want it to be—the most prosperous major economy in the world by the 2030s. That is within the grasp of our generation, provided we take the big decisions. On Friday we will set out our plan for productivity, to help realise this ambition. I want to thank my new Treasury colleague Jim O’Neill for his work as a world-leading economist in putting it together. Major British businesses, led by Sir Charlie Mayfield, have told me that they want to be part of the solution to this great challenge and we very much welcome that Let me today set out the key parts of that plan. First, on transport, four fifths of all journeys in this country are by road, yet we rank behind Puerto Rico and Namibia in the quality of our network. In the past 25 years, France has built more than 2,500 miles of motorway and we have built just 300. In the last Parliament I increased road spending, even in difficult times, and set out a plan for £15 billion of new roads for the rest of this decade, but we need a long-term solution if we are going to fix Britain’s poor roads Vehicle excise duty was used to fund our roads, but not any more. And because so many new cars now fall into the low carbon emission bands, by 2017 over three quarters of new cars will pay no VED at all in the first year. That is not sustainable and it is not fair. If someone can afford a brand new car, including some of the most expensive models available, they can pay no VED. If they can afford only an older, second-hand car, they have to pay more tax. Only a Labour Government could have designed something so regressive So this is what we will do. From 2017, for brand-new cars only, we will introduce new VED bands. The duty in the first year will be set according to emissions, like today, but updated for new technology. Thereafter there will be three duty bands: zero emission, standard and premium. For standard cars—that covers 95% of all cars sold in the UK—the charge will be £140 a year. That is less than the average £166 that motorists pay today. There will be no change to VED for existing cars: no one will pay more in tax than they do today for the car they already own. In total, we will only raise the same amount of revenue from VED in the future as we do today, but that revenue will be secure for the long term And I will return this tax to the use for which it was originally intended. I am creating a new roads fund. From the end of this decade, every single penny raised in vehicle excise duty in England will go into that fund to pay for the sustained investment our roads so badly need. We will engage with the devolved Administrations on how the money is allocated there. Tax paid on people’s cars will be used to improve the roads that they drive on. It is a major reform to improve the infrastructure and productivity of our economy, and deliver a fairer tax system for the motorist We will also consult on extending the deadline for new cars and motorbikes to have their first MOT test from three years to four years, which would save motorists over £100 million a year. I can also confirm that there will be no changes to the plans for fuel duty I set out in March: fuel duty will remain frozen this year Productivity means building more roads. It also means giving people the skills they need to secure a better job. It is to our national shame that we are almost the only advanced country in the world where the skills of our 16 to 24-year-olds are no better than those of our 55 to 64-year-olds. The education reforms we started in the last Parliament have begun to address this problem, and we are going further in this Parliament by tackling the coasting schools that simply are not good enough We have already doubled the number of apprenticeships to 2 million; now we are committed to 3 million more. To fund these apprenticeships and make sure they are of high quality we have to confront this truth: while many firms do a brilliant job training their workforces, too many large companies leave the training to others and take a free ride on the system, so we are going to take a radical and, frankly, long overdue approach We are going to introduce an apprenticeship levy on all large firms. Firms that offer apprenticeships can get more back than they put in. Britain’s great businesses will train up the next generation—3 million more apprenticeships with the security that will bring. The money will be directly controlled by employers, and we will work with business on how to do this. It is exactly the sort of bold step we need to take if Britain is going to raise its game Next, we have got to secure the success of our university sector, which is one of the jewels in the crown of the British economy. When we reformed student funding in the last Parliament, we were told by those who so opportunistically opposed us that it would put people from low-income backgrounds off going to university. Instead, we now see a record number of these students applying and succeeding. It is a triumph of progressive reform Now we are removing the artificial cap on student numbers, so we do not have to turn away from our universities people who want to go and who have the right grades. But we cannot afford to do this unless we tackle the cost of student maintenance grants, which is set to almost double to £3 billion over this decade. There is also a basic unfairness in asking taxpayers to fund the grants of people who are likely to earn a lot more than them The previous Labour Government actually abolished these grants, before reintroducing them. These grants have now become unaffordable. If we do not tackle this problem, our universities will become underfunded and our students will not get places. I am not prepared to let that happen, so from the 2016-17 academic year we will replace maintenance grants with loans for new students. The loans only have to be paid back once they earn over £21,000 a year. To ensure university is affordable to all students from all backgrounds, we will increase the maintenance loan available to £8,200, the highest amount of support ever provided To ensure our university system is sustainable, we will consult on freezing the loan repayment threshold for five years, and we will link the student fee cap to inflation for those institutions that can show they offer high-quality teaching. We will open the whole sector to new entrants who can deliver the highest standards. It is a major set of reforms to make sure Britain continues to have the best universities in the world. It is fair to students, fair to taxpayers and vital to secure our long-term economic future Britain’s weak productivity is also driven by the fact that too much of our economic strength is concentrated in this capital city. This is unhealthy and unproductive, and we must achieve a better settlement for the future, but not by pulling London down. One of the first pieces of advice I received in the Treasury was to cancel the plan for the Crick Institute, the Tate Modern extension and Crossrail, but I rejected that advice, because I have always believed it is to our nation’s great advantage that we have one of the world’s great capitals. Now we are working with the Mayor on what this city will need in the future, with projects such as Crossrail 2 and the exciting development of the Olympic village What really drives this Government is building up other parts of the United Kingdom as a balance to London’s strength. For Scotland, we are now delivering, as promised, major devolution of tax and welfare powers. Instead of complaining endlessly about process in Westminster, the SNP Scottish Government will soon have to answer the question, “You’ve got the powers, when are you going to use them? ” In Wales, we are honouring our commitments to a funding floor and to more devolution there, and investing in important new infrastructure such as the M4 and the Great Western line. In Northern Ireland, we are working with all parties to deliver the Stormont House agreement and sustainable public finances there Devolution to the nations of the United Kingdom is well established. In my view, devolution within England has only just begun. Today, we go further in building the northern powerhouse. I can today announce that I have reached agreement with the leaders of the 10 councils of Greater Manchester to devolve further powers to that city. These include putting fire services under the control of the new Mayor, establishing a land commission in the city and further collaboration on children’s services and employment programmes The historic devolution that we have agreed with Greater Manchester in return for a directly elected Mayor is available to other cities that want to go down a similar path. I can also tell the House that we are now working towards deals with the Sheffield and Liverpool city regions and with Leeds, West Yorkshire and partner authorities on far-reaching devolution of power in return for the creation of directly elected Mayors. We have created Transport for the North, and I am now putting it on a statutory footing. I can announce £30 million of funding to this new body as it connects northern England together, with seamless Oyster-style ticketing across the region Next, with the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromsgrove (Sajid Javid), we are pushing for more powers and responsibility to be devolved to the midlands—that engine of growth. The massive £7.2 billion investment in transport in the south-west is under way, and in the first of our new county deals, we are making progress on a major plan to give Cornwall a greater say over local decisions Across England, we are launching a new round of enterprise zones for smaller towns. To celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday, a new set of prestigious regius professorships will be created in universities right across the country. To give more power to counties and to our new Mayors, we are going to give them the power to set the Sunday trading hours in their areas. Let us invest across our country, let people decide and let us put the power into the northern powerhouse Another key to raising the productivity of our country is building more homes and creating a fairer property market. This is a Government that are unwavering in their support for home ownership. That is why we are introducing the new Help to Buy ISA this autumn, that is why we are giving housing association tenants the right to buy and that is why we will set out further planning reforms on Friday Today, I will set out three important changes that will address unfairnesses in our taxation of property and put the security of home ownership first. First, we will create a more level playing field between those buying a home to let and those buying a home to live in. Buy-to-let landlords have a huge advantage in the market as they can offset their mortgage interest payments against their income whereas homebuyers cannot, and the better off the landlord, the more tax relief they get. For the wealthiest, for every pound of mortgage interest costs they incur, they get 45p back from the taxpayer. All this has contributed to the rapid growth in buy-to-let properties, which now account for over 15% of new mortgages, something the Bank of England warned us last week could pose a risk to our financial stability So we will act, but we will act in a proportionate and gradual way, because I know that many hard-working people who have saved and invested in property depend on the rental income they get. We will retain mortgage interest relief on residential property, but we will now restrict it to the basic rate of income tax. To help people to adjust, we will phase in the withdrawal of the higher rate reliefs over a four-year period, and only start withdrawal in April 2017 Secondly, the rent-a-room relief is designed to help homeowners who rent out a room in their home. It is a good scheme, particularly in a world where more and more people are renting out rooms online, but the relief has been frozen at £4,250 for 18 years. Next year, we will raise it to £7,500 The third change fulfils a long-standing promise that I made, and one that I was unable to fulfil in coalition. The left will never understand this, but we on the Conservative Benches know that the wish to pass something on to your children is about the most basic, human and natural aspiration there is. Inheritance tax was designed to be paid by the very rich, yet today more families are pulled into the inheritance tax net than ever before, and the number is set to double over the next five years. It is not fair and we will act From 2017, we will phase in a new £175,000 allowance for someone’s home when they leave it to their children or grandchildren. That sits on top of the existing £325,000 threshold, which will be fixed until the end of 2020-21. Both allowances can be transferred to a spouse or partner. From today, we will make sure that those who choose to downsize do not lose any of the allowance from the property that they used to own, but we will taper the relief away for estates worth more than £2 million The result for families is this: they can pass up to £1 million on to their children free of inheritance tax. No more inheritance tax on family homes: aspiration supported, the tax paid only by the rich, the security of home ownership restored—promise made; promise delivered The cut in inheritance tax will be more than paid for by changes which we have set out to the pensions tax relief that we give to the highest earners. From next year, their annual allowance will be tapered away to a minimum of £10,000 Our pension reforms have given huge freedom to people who have worked hard and saved hard all their lives. Many thousands of people are, with the free guidance service we offer, making use of those freedoms to access their savings instead of buying annuities. Now it is time that we looked at the other end of the age scale—at those who are starting to save for a pension. For the truth is that Britain is not saving enough, and that is something we need to fix in our economy too While we have taken important steps with our new single-tier pension and generous new ISA, I am open to further radical change. Pensions could be treated like ISAs: people pay in from taxed income, it is tax free when they take it out and in between it receives a top-up from the Government. That idea, and others like it, need careful and public consideration before we take any steps, so I am today publishing a Green Paper that asks questions, invites views and takes care not to prejudge the answer. Our goal is clear: we want to move from an economy built on debt to an economy built on the more secure and productive foundations of saving and long-term investment If Britain wants to produce more, it needs to invest more. Many small and medium-sized businesses have benefited from our enhanced annual investment allowance. The allowance was set at £100,000 when we came to office. It is higher now, but without action it will fall to just £25,000 at the end of the year. That would especially hit middle-sized companies in areas such as manufacturing and agriculture, which we want to do more to build up in Britain, so I can confirm that the annual investment allowance will not fall to £25,000, but will be set at £200,000 this year and in every single year. That is a major, permanent boost to the incentives for long-term investment by small and medium-sized firms in Britain The large reductions in tax on North sea oil and gas that I announced in March are going ahead, and today we broaden the types of investment that qualify for allowances. Now that we have a long-term framework for investment in renewable energy in place, we will remove the outdated climate change levy exemption for renewable electricity that has seen taxpayer money benefiting electricity generation abroad We cut corporation tax from 28% to 20% over the last Parliament—one of the biggest boosts British business has ever seen. We cannot take it lower than that while such strong incentives are created for people to self-incorporate and pay the lower rates of tax due on dividends. The dividend tax system was designed partly to offset double taxation on profits, but the system has not changed despite sharp reductions in corporation tax. Lower rates are rapidly creating opportunities for tax planning. Irreparable damage was done when a previous Chancellor abolished the payable credit and deprived pension funds of billions of pounds. We have inherited a complex and archaic system, so I am today undertaking a major and long-overdue reform to simplify the taxation of dividends. The dividend tax credit will be replaced with a new tax-free allowance of £5,000 of dividend income for all taxpayers. The rates of dividend tax will be set at 7.5%, 32.5% and 38.1%—an increase of 7.5% where dividend income exceeds £5,000. Dividends paid within pensions and ISAs will remain tax free and unaffected by these changes. Those who either pay themselves in dividends or have large shareholdings worth typically over £140,000 will pay more tax; 85% of those who receive dividends will see no change or will be better off; and over a million people will see their tax cut That is an important reform. It comes into operation next year, and with our personal allowance and our new personal savings allowance, it means that from April, on top of the new ISA, people will be able to receive up to £17,000 of income a year tax free. The reforms that I have announced to dividend taxation also allow us to do something more, and go further in creating a Britain that is one of the most competitive economies in the world There are those in this House who said we were wrong to cut corporation tax in the last Parliament, but it created millions more jobs, brought businesses back to Britain and increased much-needed investment, so I profoundly disagree with them. Now at 20% for large and small businesses alike, we have the joint lowest rate of corporation tax in the G20, so there are those who say we do not need to do more. I profoundly disagree with them too. This country cannot afford to stand still while others rush ahead. I am not prepared to see that happen Today, I announce that I am cutting it again. Britain’s corporation tax rate will fall to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020. We are giving businesses lower taxes that they can count on, so that they can grow with confidence, invest with confidence and create jobs with confidence. A new 18% rate of corporation tax—sending out loud and clear the message around the world that Britain is open for business If we are to build a more productive economy, and our country is to live within its means, we have to make this fundamental change: we have to move Britain from a low-wage, high-tax, high-welfare society to a higher-wage, lower-tax, lower-welfare economy. For Britain is home to 1% of the world’s population, generates 4% of the world’s income, and yet pays out 7% of the world’s welfare spending. It is not fair to the taxpayers who are paying for it, and it needs to change Welfare spending is not sustainable and it crowds out spending on things such as education and infrastructure that are vital to securing the real welfare of the people. We legislated for savings of over £21 billion in the last Parliament, capped benefits for out-of-work families and started to introduce universal credit. Universal credit will transform the lives of those trapped in welfare dependency and deliver real social justice. It is the result of the Herculean efforts of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions However, to live within our means as a country and better protect spending on public services, we need to find at least a further £12 billion of welfare savings. Let me set out the principles that we will follow and how they will be applied. First, the welfare system should always support the elderly, the vulnerable and disabled people. We will honour the commitments that we made to uprate the state pension by the triple lock and protect the other pensioner benefits. The BBC has agreed to take on responsibility for funding free TV licences for the over-75s. In return, we are able to give our valued public broadcaster a sustainable income for the long term In the last Parliament, we increased payments to the most disabled people, and we will not tax or means-test disability benefits. We will increase funding for domestic abuse victims and women’s refuge centres. We are also going to use the remaining funds available in our Equitable Life payment scheme, as it closes, to double the support that we give to those policyholders on pension credit who need this extra help most The second principle we will apply is that those who can work will be expected to look for work and take it when it is offered. The best route out of poverty is work. Our economic plan has created a record number of jobs, and now a third of a million fewer children are being brought up in workless families It is not acceptable that in an economy moving towards full employment, some young people leave school and go straight on to a life on benefits, so for those aged 18 to 21 we are introducing a new youth obligation that says that they must either earn or learn. We are also abolishing the automatic entitlement to housing benefit for 18 to 21-year-olds. Exceptions will be made for vulnerable people and other hard cases, but young people in the benefits system should face the same choices as other young people who go out to work and cannot yet afford to leave home To make sure that work pays for parents, I confirm that from September 2017 all working parents of three and four year-olds will receive free childcare of up to 30 hours a week. Once again: a promise made; a promise delivered. As a result, we now expect parents—including lone parents—with a youngest child aged three to look for work if they want to claim universal credit. That is all part of our progressive goal of securing full employment in Britain We also want to increase employment among those who have health challenges but are capable of taking steps back to work. The employment and support allowance, introduced by the last Labour Government, was supposed to end some of the perverse incentives in the old incapacity benefit, but instead it has introduced new ones. One of those is that those who are placed in the work-related activity group receive more money a week than those on jobseeker’s allowance, but get nothing like the help to find suitable employment. The number of JSA claimants has fallen by 700,000 since 2010, while the number of incapacity benefits claimants has fallen by just 90,000. That is despite 61% of claimants on the ESA WRAG benefit saying that they want to work. Therefore, for future claimants only, we will align the ESA WRAG rate with the rate of jobseeker’s allowance. No current claimants will be affected by that change, and we will provide new funding for additional support to help claimants return to work The third principle that we apply to welfare is this: the whole working-age benefit system has to be put on a more sustainable footing. In 1980, working-age welfare accounted for 8% of all public spending. Today it is 13%. The original tax credit system, introduced by the last Labour Government, cost £1.1 billion in its first year. This year, that cost has reached £30 billion. We in Britain spend more on family benefits than Germany, France or Sweden—[Interruption. ]', 'Madam Deputy Speaker, I have heard your words and those of Mr Speaker. I have the greatest respect for you both and want to assure you that I have listened very carefully to what you have said. May I also send my best wishes to the Leader of the Opposition? I know that the whole House will join me in doing that With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, let me turn to today’s Budget. Employment is up, investment is growing, public services are improving, the public finances are stabilising and wages are rising. Today’s Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors; stronger public finances, with our debt under control; and stronger employment, with fewer people out of work and more people in work. Growth is up, jobs are up and debt is down. Let there be no doubt: our plan is working This Budget is about what this Government are about: investment in a more innovative, high-skilled economy, because that is the only sustainable path to individual prosperity; world-class public services, because they are the common goods from which we all benefit; backing business, because our future cannot be built by the Government alone but must come from the imagination and drive of our entrepreneurs; help for working families with the cost of living, because we will always give people the support they need and the tools to build a better life for themselves; and levelling up, because for too long—far too long—the location of your birth has determined too much of your future, and because the awesome power of opportunity should not be available only to a wealthy few but be the birthright of every child in an independent and prosperous United Kingdom Today’s Budget does not draw a line under covid; we have challenging months ahead, and I encourage everyone eligible to get their booster jabs as soon as possible. But today’s Budget does begin the work of preparing for a new economy post covid: the Prime Minister’s economy of higher wages, higher skills and rising productivity, and of strong public services, vibrant communities and safer streets—an economy fit for a new age of optimism, where the only limit to our potential is the effort we are prepared to put in and the sacrifices we are prepared to make. That is the stronger economy of the future, and this Budget is the foundation The House will recognise the challenging backdrop of rising inflation. Let me begin by carefully explaining what is happening in our economy and why. Inflation in September was 3.1% and is likely to rise further, with the Office for Budget Responsibility expecting the consumer prices index to average 4% over the next year. The majority of this rise in inflation can be explained by two global forces. First, as economies around the world reopen, demand for goods has increased more quickly than supply chains can meet. Having been shut down for almost a year, it takes time for factories to scale up production, for container ships to move goods to where demand is and for businesses to hire the people they need Secondly, global demand for energy has surged at a time when supplies have already been disrupted, putting a strain on prices. In the year to September, the global wholesale price of oil, coal and gas combined has more than doubled The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease. It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight. I am in regular communication with Finance Ministers around the world and it is clear that these are shared global problems, neither unique to the UK nor possible for us to address on our own. But where the Government can ease these pressures, we will act. To address the driver shortage, the Transport Secretary is introducing temporary visas, tackling testing backlogs and changing cabotage requirements, and is today announcing new funding to improve lorry park facilities. We have already suspended the HGV levy until August, and I can do more today, extending it for a further year until 2023 and freezing vehicle excise duty for heavy goods vehicles To help with the cost of living, we have introduced a new £500 million household support fund, and today’s Budget will support working families further On our fiscal policy, we will meet our commitments on public services and capital investment, but we will do so keeping in mind the need to control inflation Finally, I have written to the Governor of the Bank of England today to reaffirm the Bank’s remit to achieve low and stable inflation. People should be reassured: it has a strong track record in doing so I understand that people are concerned about global inflation, but they have a Government here at home ready and willing to act. In a period of global uncertainty, we need to work hard to maintain a strong economy and be responsible with the public finances, and that is what we are doing. I am grateful to the OBR for its work, and I am pleased to say that it now expects our recovery to be quicker. Thanks to this Government’s actions, it forecasts the economy to return to its pre-covid level at the turn of the year—earlier than it thought in March Growth this year is revised up from 4% to 6.5%. The OBR then expects the economy to grow by 6% in 2022, and 2.1 %, 1.3% and 1.6% over the next three years. In July last year, at the height of the pandemic, unemployment was expected to peak at 12% Today, the OBR expects unemployment to peak at just 5.2%. That means more than 2 million fewer people out of work than previously feared. Wages are rising: compared with those in February 2020, they have grown in real terms by almost 3.5%. I can confirm for the House that the OBR’s forecast for business investment has been revised up over the next five years Because of the actions that we took to support our economy, we have been more successful than previously feared in preventing the long-term economic damage of covid The OBR has today revised down its scarring assumption from 3% to 2%. In the depths of the worst economic crisis on record, we set out a plan for jobs. It is a plan that was backed by business groups and trade bodies; a plan that has helped millions of people and saved millions of jobs; and a plan that the OBR has today described as “remarkably successful”. Today’s forecasts confirm beyond doubt that our plan for jobs is working Disruption in the global economy highlights the importance of strong public finances. Coronavirus left us with borrowing higher than at any time since the second world war. As the Prime Minister reminded us in his conference speech: higher borrowing today is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes tomorrow. We need to strengthen our public finances so that when the next crisis comes, we have the fiscal space to act. Today I am publishing a new charter for budget responsibility. The charter sets out two fiscal rules that will keep this Government on the path of discipline and responsibility. First, underlying public sector net debt, excluding the impact of the Bank of England, must, as a percentage of GDP, be falling. Secondly, in normal times the state should only borrow to invest in our future growth and prosperity. Everyday spending must be paid for through taxation. Both rules must be met by the third year of every forecast period, giving us the flexibility to respond to crises while credibly keeping the public finances under control. These rules are supplemented by targets to spend up to 3% of GDP on capital investment and to keep welfare spending on a sustainable path The House will be asked to vote on our charter, giving Members a simple choice—to abandon our fiscal anchor and leave our economy adrift with reckless unfunded pledges, or to vote for what we on the Government side of the House know is the right course: sound public finances and a stronger economy for the British people Important as the charter is, our credibility comes as much from what we do as what we say, so I am pleased to tell the House that, because our plan is delivering a stronger economy and because we have taken tough but responsible decisions on the public finances, the OBR reports today that all our fiscal rules have been met. Underlying debt is forecast to be 85.2% of GDP this year, then 85.4% in 2022-23, before peaking at 85.7% in 2023-24. It then falls in the final three years of the forecast, from 85.1% to 83.3%. Borrowing as a percentage of GDP is forecast to fall in every single year, from 7.9% this year to 3.3% next year, then 2.4%, 1.7%, 1.7% and 1.5% in the following years. Borrowing down, debt down: proving once again it is the Conservatives, and only the Conservatives, who can be trusted with taxpayers’ money I have made four fiscal judgements in this Budget. First, we will meet our fiscal rules with a margin to protect ourselves against economic risks. That is the responsible decision at a time of increasing global economic uncertainty, when our public finances are twice as sensitive to changes in interest rates as they were before the pandemic and six times as sensitive as they were before the financial crisis. Just a one percentage point increase in inflation and interest rates would cost us around £23 billion. My second judgment today is to continue to support working families Thirdly, as well as helping people at home, our improving fiscal position means that we will meet our obligations to the world’s poorest. I told the House that when we met our fiscal tests, we would return to spending 0.7% of our national income on overseas aid. Some people said this was a trick or a device. I told this House that it was no such thing, and based on the tests that I set out, today’s forecasts show that we are, in fact, scheduled to return to 0.7% in 2024-25—before the end of this Parliament My fourth fiscal judgment is this: today’s Budget increases total departmental spending over this Parliament by £150 billion. That is the largest increase this century, with spending growing by 3.8% a year in real terms. As a result of this spending review, and contrary to speculation, there will be a real-terms rise in overall spending for every single Department, and public sector net investment as a share of GDP will be at the highest sustained level for nearly half a century. If anyone still doubts it, today’s Budget confirms it: the Conservatives are the real party of public services Our stronger economy lays the foundation for everything that we want to achieve in today’s Budget: world class public services and more investment in our future growth. Before I turn to the details, I would like to thank the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, my right hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Mr Clarke). Completing the spending review in such challenging circumstances was a tall order—and thankfully we had just the man for the job At the start of this Parliament, resource spending on healthcare was £133 billion. Today’s spending review confirms that by the end of this Parliament it will increase by £44 billion to over £177 billion; and the extra revenue we are forecast to raise from the health and social care levy is going direct to the NHS and social care as promised. The health capital budget will be the largest since 2010: record investment in health R&D, including better newborn screening, as campaigned for by my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Nickie Aiken); 40 new hospitals; 70 hospital upgrades; more operating theatres to tackle the backlog; and 100 community diagnostic centres, all staffed by a bigger, better-trained workforce, with 50,000 more nurses and 50 million more primary care appointments. As well as funding to deliver the Prime Minister’s historic reforms to social care, we are providing local government with new grant funding over the next three years of £4.8 billion—the largest increase in core funding for over a decade We are investing more in housing and home ownership too, with a multi-year housing settlement totalling nearly £24 billion—£11.5 billion to build up to 180,000 new affordable homes, the largest cash investment in a decade, 20% more than the previous programme. We are investing an extra £1.8 billion—enough to bring 1,500 hectares of brownfield land into use, meet our commitment to invest £10 billion in new housing, and unlock 1 million new homes. We are also confirming £5 billion to remove unsafe cladding from the highest risk buildings, partly funded by the residential property developers tax, which I can confirm will be levied on developers with profits over £25 million at a rate of 4%. We have already reduced rough sleeping by over a third, but we will go further, with £640 million a year for rough sleeping and homelessness—an 85% increase in funding compared to 2019 Today’s Budget funds our ambition to recruit 20,000 new police officers; provides an extra £2.2 billion for courts, prisons and probation services, including £0.5 billion to reduce the courts backlog; pays for programmes to tackle neighbourhood crime, reoffending, county lines, violence against women and girls, victims’ services and improved responses to rape cases; and, over the next three years, commits £3.8 billion to the largest prison-building programme in a generation All Governments should aspire to provide greater life chances for future generations, but few Governments can match our ambition. So let me now turn to what this Budget does to support children. The evidence is compelling that the first 1,001 days of a child’s life are the most important. My right hon. Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire (Dame Andrea Leadsom) has recognised this with her inspirational report. We are responding today with £300 million for a start for life offer for families; high-quality parenting programmes; tailored services to help with perinatal mental health; and, I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce), funding to create a network of family hubs around the country too. To improve the quality of childcare, we are going to pay providers more, with today’s spending review providing an extra £170 million by 2024-25. We are confirming £150 million to support training and development for the entire early years workforce. To help up to 300,000 more families facing multiple needs, we are investing an extra £200 million in the supporting families programme, and we will provide over £200 million a year to continue the holiday activities and food programme Today’s spending review also delivers our commitment to schools, with an extra £4.7 billion by 2024-25, which, combined with the ambitious plans we announced at spending review 2019, will restore per-pupil funding to 2010 levels in real terms, equivalent to a cash increase for every pupil of more than £1,500. For children with special educational needs and disabilities, we are more than tripling the amount we invest to create 30,000 new school places. We know that the pandemic caused significant disruption to children’s learning. We have already announced £3.1 billion to help education recovery. Today, as promised by the Prime Minister and the Education Secretary, we will go further, with just under £2 billion of new funding to help schools and colleges, bringing this Government’s total support for education recovery to almost £5 billion As we level up public services, we are also levelling up communities, restoring the pride people feel in the places they call home. To do that, we are providing £560 million for youth services, enough to fund up to 300 youth clubs in England; over £200 million to build or transform up to 8,000 state-of-the-art community football pitches across the UK; and funding to turn over 100 areas of derelict land into new “pocket parks” I am allocating the first round of bids from the levelling up fund—£1.7 billion to invest in the infrastructure of everyday life in over 100 local areas. With £170 million in Scotland, £120 million in Wales, and £50 million in Northern Ireland—more than their Barnett shares—this will benefit the whole United Kingdom. We are backing projects in Aberdeen, Bury, Burnley, Lewes, Clwyd South, and not one, not two, but three successful projects for the great city of Stoke-on-Trent. But that is not all. We are also going to fund projects in Ashton-under-Lyne, Doncaster, South Leicester, Sunderland and West Leeds. We are so committed to levelling up, we are even levelling up the Opposition Front Bench Levelling up is also about protecting our unique culture and heritage. The British Museum; Tate Liverpool; the York Railway Museum: we are investing £850 million to protect museums, galleries, libraries, and local culture. Thanks to the Culture Secretary, over 100 regional museums and libraries will be renovated, restored and revived; and she has secured up to £2 million to start work on a new Beatles attraction on the Liverpool waterfront. We are also going to review our museum freedoms and make our creative tax reliefs more generous. On current plans, the tax relief for museums and galleries is due to end in March next year, just as exhibitions are starting to tour again, so I have decided to extend it for two years to March 2024. To support theatres, orchestras, museums and galleries to recover from covid, the tax reliefs for all those sectors, from today until April 2023, will be doubled, and they will not return to the normal rate until April 2024. That is a tax relief for culture worth almost a quarter of a billion pounds. This is a Budget for the whole United Kingdom. Through the Barnett formula, today’s decisions increase Scottish Government funding, in each year, by an average of £4.6 billion, Welsh Government funding by £2.5 billion, and £1.6 billion for the Northern Ireland Executive. This delivers, in real terms, the largest block grants for the devolved Administrations since the devolution settlements of 1998. The whole of the United Kingdom will benefit from the UK shared prosperity fund, and over time we will ramp up funding so that total domestic UK-wide funding will match EU receipts, averaging around £1.5 billion a year. We will fund projects across the UK, including funding for the Extreme E race in Scotland—the 2022 Hebrides X-Prix—accelerating funding for the Cardiff city region deal in Wales, and funding in Northern Ireland for community cohesion. While today demonstrates the indisputable fiscal benefit of being part of the United Kingdom, this is and always will be secondary to the simple truth that we are bound together by more than transactional benefit. It is our collective history, our culture and our security. We are, and always will be, one family and one United Kingdom While today’s Budget delivers historically high levels of public spending, its success will be measured not by the billions we spend, but by the outcomes we achieve and the difference we make to people’s lives. The budgets are set; the plans are in place; the task is clear. Now we must deliver because this is not the Government’s money—it is taxpayer’s money Our stronger economy allows us to fund world-class public services—the people’s priority—but over the long-term, the only way to pay for higher spending is economic growth. If we want to see higher growth, we have to tackle the problem that has been holding back this country for far too long: our uneven economic geography. As we come out of the worst economic shock we have ever seen, we have a choice—to retrench, or to invest. This Government choose to invest: to invest in our economic infrastructure, to invest in innovation, to invest in skills and to invest in a plan for growth that builds a stronger economy for the future. That is what this Budget is about and that is what this Government are about Infrastructure connects our country, drives productivity and levels up. That is why our national infrastructure strategy invests in economic infrastructure such as roads, railways, broadband and mobile—over £130 billion. To connect our towns and cities, we are investing £21 billion on roads and £46 billion on railways. Our integrated rail plan will be published soon, dramatically improving journey times between our towns and cities. Today, we are providing £5.7 billion for London-style transport settlements in Greater Manchester, the Liverpool city region, the Tees Valley, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, the west midlands and the west of England. We are helping local transport everywhere with £2.6 billion for a long-term pipeline of more than 50 local roads upgrades, over £5 billion for local roads maintenance—enough to fill 1 million more potholes a year—and funding for buses, cycling and walking totalling more than £5 billion. The Prime Minister promised an infrastructure revolution. This Budget delivers an infrastructure revolution Investment in our infrastructure is just the first step. We need to do what the people of this country have always done: invent, discover, and create the ideas and technologies that will change the world. So we will also invest more in innovation. The UK is already a world leader. With less than 1% of the world’s population, we have four of the world’s top 20 universities, 14% of the world’s most impactful research and the second most Nobel laureates. We want to go further. I can confirm we will maintain our target to increase research and development investment to £22 billion. But in order to get there, and deliver on our other priorities, we will reach the target in 2026-27, spending, by the end of this Parliament, £20 billion a year on R&D. That is a cash increase of 50%—the fastest increase ever. I can confirm for the House that this £20 billion is in addition to the cost of our R&D tax reliefs. Combined with those tax reliefs, total public investment in R&D is increasing from 0.7% of GDP in 2018 to 1.1% of GDP by the end of the Parliament How does 1.1% compare internationally? Well, the latest available data shows an OECD average of just 0.7%. Germany is investing 0.9%, France 1% and the United States just 0.7%. This unprecedented funding will: increase core science funding to £5.9 billion a year by 2024-25, a cash increase of 37%; meet the full costs of associating with Horizon Europe; establish the new Advanced Research and Invention Agency with £800 million by 2025-26; and strengthen our focus on late-stage innovation, increasing Innovate UK’s annual core budget to £1 billion, double what it was at the start of the Parliament There is more to becoming a science superpower than just what the Government spend on R&D. Our ambitious net zero strategy is also an innovation strategy, investing £30 billion to create the new green industries of the future. We have just issued our second green bond, making us the third-largest issuer of sovereign green bonds anywhere in the world. London last week was named the best place in the world for green finance. On Monday, the new UK Infrastructure Bank announced its first ever investment: £107 million to support offshore wind in Teesside. To build on this work, one week today I will be hosting global finance ministers and businesses at COP26 Innovation comes from the imagination, drive and risk-taking of business. That is why we have launched Help to Grow to turbocharge SME productivity and started a new co-investment venture capital fund, Future Fund: Breakthrough. It is why I am announcing today that we will consult on further changes to the regulatory charge cap for pensions schemes, unlocking institutional investment while protecting savers. It is why we are introducing a new £1.4 billion global Britain investment fund, supporting transformative economic activity in our world-leading sectors, such as life sciences. It is why today’s Budget increases the British Business Bank’s regional financing programmes to £1.6 billion, expanding their coverage and helping innovative businesses get access to the finance they need, across the whole United Kingdom A third of our science Nobel laureates have been immigrants. Half of our fastest growing companies have a foreign-born founder. So an economy built on innovation must be open and attractive to the best and brightest minds. Thanks to our brilliant Home Secretary, today’s Budget confirms the eligibility criteria for our new scale-up visa, making it quicker and easier for fast-growing businesses to bring in highly skilled individuals. The Trade Secretary’s new global talent network, launching initially in the Bay Area, Boston and Bangalore, will identify, attract and relocate the best global talent in science and tech sectors. It is all part of our plan to make our visa system for international talent the most competitive in the world If we want greater private sector innovation, we need to make our research and development tax reliefs fit for purpose. The latest figures show the UK has the second highest spending on R&D tax reliefs in the OECD. Yet it is not working as well as it should; UK business investment in R&D is less than half the OECD average. We have reviewed the reliefs and identified two issues we are solving today. First, the reliefs need to reflect how businesses conduct research in the modern world. So, as many companies have called for, I am expanding the scope of the reliefs to include cloud computing and data costs The second problem is this: companies claimed UK tax relief on £48 billion of R&D spending, yet UK business investment was around half of that, at just £26 billion. We are subsidising billions of pounds of R&D that is not even happening here in the United Kingdom. That is unfair on British taxpayers and it puts us out of step with places like Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Switzerland and the USA, which have all focused their R&D tax reliefs on domestic activity. So from April 2023, we are going to do the same, and incentivise greater investment here at home. So a £22-billion investment in R&D, the net zero strategy, the future fund, Help to Grow, more regional finance, unlocking institutional capital, a more competitive visa system and a modernised R&D tax credits regime—enough action to prove the hypothesis that we are making this country a science and technology superpower As well as investing in infrastructure and innovation, there is one further part of our plan for growth that is crucial: providing a world-class education to all our people. Higher skills lead to higher regional productivity and higher productivity leads to higher wages. With 80% of the UK’s 2030 workforce already in work, our future success depends on not just the schooling we give our children but the lifelong learning we offer to adults We have already done a lot. Our plan for jobs invested in apprenticeships, traineeships and the kickstart scheme, but we need to go further. Today’s Budget invests in the most wide-ranging skills agenda this country has seen in decades. We are increasing skills spending over the Parliament by £3.8 billion—an increase of 42%. We are expanding T-levels, building institutes of technology, rolling out the Prime Minister’s lifetime skills guarantee, upgrading our further education college estate, quadrupling the number of places on skills bootcamps and significantly increasing funding for apprenticeships We are also going to tackle a tragic fact: millions of adults in our country have numeracy skills lower than those expected of a nine-year-old. According to the leading charity National Numeracy, this costs individuals with poor numeracy up to £1,600 a year in lost earnings. People with poor numeracy skills are more than twice as likely to be unemployed as their peers. So today, I can announce a new UK-wide numeracy programme: Multiply. With £560 million, Multiply will improve basic maths skills and help to change people’s lives across the whole United Kingdom. So we are building our infrastructure with new roads, railways and broadband; cementing our status as a science and technology superpower; and strengthening the skills of our people, the country’s greatest asset. That is a real plan for growth and that is how this Government are building a stronger economy for the British people World class public services are the people’s priority. Investment in infrastructure, innovation and skills will create the growth that we need to pay for them. But as Conservatives, we know that Government action alone will not be enough to create a stronger economy. We want this country to be the most exciting and dynamic place in the world for business. Now that we have left the EU, we have the freedom to do things differently and deliver a simpler, fairer tax system I want to begin with one of our smallest taxes, but a tax that plays an important role in one of our pre-eminent industries: shipping. Now that we have left the EU, today we start reforming our tonnage tax regime to make it simpler and more competitive. And we are also making it fairer for UK taxpayers When we were in the old EU system, ships in the tonnage tax regime were required to fly the flag of an EU state, but that does not make sense for an independent nation. So I can announce today that our tonnage tax will, for the first time ever, reward companies for adopting the UK’s merchant shipping flag, the red ensign. That is entirely fitting for a country with such a proud maritime history as ours. I am sure that the Opposition will be delighted that red flags are still flying somewhere in this country, even if they are all at sea Let me turn now to air passenger duty. Right now, people pay more for return flights within and between the four nations of the United Kingdom than they do when flying home from abroad. We used to have a return-leg exemption for domestic flights, but we were required to remove it in 2001. But today I can announce that flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will, from April 2023, be subject to a new lower rate of air passenger duty. This will help to cut the cost of living, with 9 million passengers seeing their duty cut by half; it will bring people together across the United Kingdom; and because they tend to have a greater proportion of domestic passengers, it is a boost to regional airports like Aberdeen, Belfast, Inverness and Southampton Airports are major regional employers, so to help them get through the winter I am also extending our support for English airports for a further six months. We are also making changes to reduce carbon emissions from aviation. Most emissions come from international rather than domestic aviation, so we are introducing, from April 2023, a new ultra-long-haul band in air passenger duty covering flights of over 5,500 miles, with an economy rate of £91. Less than 5% of passengers will pay more, but those who fly furthest will pay the most Our approach to corporate taxation strikes a responsible balance between funding public services and encouraging the investment we need for a stronger economy. At the March Budget, we took the difficult but necessary decision to increase the rate of corporation tax to 25% from 2023, which is still the lowest rate in the G7 and the fifth lowest rate in the G20. Alongside, I introduced the new super deduction—the biggest business tax cut in modern British history—and extended, to the end of this year, the annual investment allowance at its higher level of £1 million. Now is not the time to remove tax breaks on investment, so I can confirm today that the £1 million annual investment allowance will not end in December as planned. It will be extended all the way to March 2023 I also said in March that I would review the bank surcharge within corporation tax to maintain the competitiveness of our financial services industry. We will retain a surcharge of 3%. The overall rate for corporation tax on banks will, in 2023, increase from 27% to 28% and will remain higher than the rate paid by other companies. Small challenger banks are improving banking competition, which is good for the sector and good for consumers, so to help them, I will also raise the annual allowance to £100 million Our manifesto promised to review business rates. We are publishing our conclusions today. Before I set out our plans, let me say this: we on the Conservative Benches are clear that reckless, unfunded promises to abolish a tax that raises £25 billion every year are completely irresponsible. It would be wrong to find £25 billion a year in extra borrowing, cuts to public services or tax rises elsewhere, so we will retain business rates, but with key reforms to ease the burden and create stronger high streets First, we will make the business rates system fairer and timelier with more frequent revaluations every three years. The new revaluation cycle will be delivered from 2023. Secondly, as called for by the Federation of Small Businesses and the British Property Federation, we are introducing a new investment relief to encourage businesses to adopt green technologies such as solar panels I am announcing today that we will accept the CBI and the British Retail Consortium’s recommendation to introduce a new business rates improvement relief. From 2023, every single business will be able to make property improvements and, for 12 months, pay no extra business rates. That means that a hotel adding extra rooms, a manufacturer expanding their factory, and an office adding new air conditioning, CCTV or bike shelters will all pay no extra rates Together with the new green investment relief, we are introducing investment incentives totalling £750 million. This will make a difference, but without action, millions of businesses would see their tax bills going up next year because of inflation. I want to help those businesses right now, so our third step is that next year’s planned increase in the multiplier will be cancelled. That is a tax cut for businesses worth, over the next five years, £4.6 billion I have one final measure to help those businesses hardest hit by the pandemic. I am announcing today, for one year, a new 50% business rates discount for businesses in the retail, hospitality, and leisure sectors: pubs, music venues, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, theatres and gyms. Any eligible business can claim a discount on their bills of 50%, up to a maximum of £110,000. That is a business tax cut worth almost £1.7 billion. Together with small business rates relief, this means that over 90% of all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses will see a discount of at least 50%. Apart from the covid reliefs, this is the biggest single-year cut to business rates in over 30 years. Taken together, today’s Budget cuts business rates by £7 billion. We are unleashing the dynamism and creativity of British businesses with a simpler, fairer and more competitive tax system: the biggest business tax cut in modern British history; the biggest single-year cut to business rates for 30 years; a £1 million investment allowance; tonnage tax reformed; air passenger duty cut. That is the way to back business and build a stronger economy Let me turn now to alcohol duties. First introduced in 1643 to help pay for the civil war, our alcohol duty system is outdated, complex and full of historical anomalies. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has called it “a mess”; the Institute of Economic Affairs said that it “defies common sense”; and the World Health Organisation has warned that countries such as the UK which follow the EU rules are: “unable to implement tax systems that are optimal from the perspective of public health. ” So today, we are taking advantage of leaving the EU to announce the most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years. We are taking five steps today to create a system that is simpler, fairer, and healthier First, to radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six. Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines and high-strength white ciders will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed, given their strength. That is the right thing to do, and it will help to end the era of cheap, high-strength drinks which can harm public health and enable problem drinking. Because this is a more rational system, the converse is also true: many lower-alcohol drinks are currently overtaxed—and have been for many decades. Rosé, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines—today’s changes mean that they will pay less The second step I am taking today will encourage small, innovative craft producers: I am announcing proposals for a new small producer relief. This will extend the principle of the small brewers relief to include for the first time ever small cider makers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less strength than 8.5% Thirdly, I am going to modernise the system to reflect the way people drink today. Over the last decade, consumption of sparkling wines like prosecco has doubled. English sparkling wine alone has increased almost tenfold. It is clear they are no longer the preserve of wealthy elites, and they are no stronger than still wines. So I am going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines, wherever they are produced, will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength. Because growing conditions in the UK typically favour lower-strength and sparkling wines, this means English and Welsh wines, compared with stronger imported wines, will now pay less. Sales of fruit cider have increased from one in a thousand ciders sold in 2005 to one in four today, but they can pay two or three times as much duty as cider made with apples or pears, so we are cutting the duty on them too The fourth step I am taking today would directly support the home of British community life for centuries: our pubs. Even before the pandemic, pubs were struggling: between 2000 and 2019, consumption in the on-trade fell by 40%. Many public health bodies recognise that pubs are often safer drinking environments than being at home. As my hon. Friends the Members for Dudley South (Mike Wood) and for North West Durham (Mr Holden) will agree, a fairer, healthier system supports pubs, so I can announce today draught relief Draught relief will apply a new lower rate of duty on draught beer and cider. It will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres. It will particularly benefit community pubs that do 75% of their trade on draught. Let me tell the House the new rate: draught relief will cut duty by 5%. That is the biggest cut to cider duty since 1923; the biggest cut to fruit ciders in a generation; the biggest cut to beer duty for 50 years. This is not temporary. It is a long-term investment in British pubs of £100 million a year and a permanent cut in the cost of a pint of 3p. I cannot wait for the Opposition to accuse me tomorrow of beer-barrel politics These much needed reforms will come into effect in February 2023, but I want to help the hospitality industry right now, so for my final announcement on alcohol duties today, I can confirm that the planned increases in duty on spirits like Scotch whisky, wine, cider and beer will all, from midnight tonight, be cancelled. That is a tax cut worth £3 billion Our reforms make the alcohol duty system simpler, fairer and healthier; they help with the cost of living while tackling problem drinking; they support innovative entrepreneurs and craft producers; they back pubs and public health; and they are only possible because we have left the European Union World-class public services; investment in infrastructure, innovation, and skills; simpler, fairer taxes to support businesses and consumers: all built on the foundation of a stronger economy and responsible public finances. That is our vision for the future and that is what this Budget delivers This Budget also supports working families. With fuel prices at the highest level in eight years, I am not prepared to add to the squeeze on families and small businesses, so I can confirm today that the planned rise in fuel duty will be cancelled. That is a saving over the next five years of almost £8 billion. Compared to pre-2010 plans, today’s freeze means the average tank of fuel will cost around £15 less per car; £30 less for vans; and £130 less for HGVs. After 12 consecutive years of frozen rates, the average car driver will now save a total of £1,900 I can also announce today that public sector workers will see fair and affordable pay rises across the whole spending review period as we return to the normal, independent pay-setting process, and I can take action to help the lowest paid as well. It was a Conservative Government who introduced the national living wage in 2016, a Conservative Government who, according to statistics published just yesterday, have overseen the proportion of people in low-paid work falling to its lowest level since 1997, and it is a Conservative Government who are increasing the wage floor again today. The independent Low Pay Commission brings together economists, business groups and trade unions. The Government are accepting its recommendation to increase the national living wage next year by 6.6%, to £9.50 an hour. For a full-time worker that is a pay rise worth over £1,000. It will benefit over 2 million of the lowest paid workers in the country, it is broadly consistent with previous increases, it keeps us on track for our target of two thirds of median earnings by 2024, and it is a major commitment to the high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy of the future As we build this stronger economy, we are doing so at the end of an extraordinary 18 months. Covid was not just a public health challenge and an economic challenge—it was a moral challenge, too. We had to show we could pull together as a country, and we did. We had to put aside questions of ideology and orthodoxy to do whatever it took to care for our people and each other, and we did There is a different moral dimension to the economic challenge we face now. Last year, the state grew to be over half the size of the total economy, and taxes are rising to their highest level as a percentage of GDP since the 1950s. I do not like it, but I cannot apologise for it: it is the result of the unprecedented crisis we faced and the extraordinary action we took in response. But now we have a choice: do we want to live in a country where the response to every question is “What are the Government going to do about it? ” , where every time prices rise, every time a company gets in trouble, every time some new challenge emerges, the answer is always that the taxpayer must pay? Or do we choose to recognise that Government has limits Government should have limits. If this seems a controversial statement to make, then I am all the more glad for saying it because that means it needed saying. And it is what we believe. There is a reason we talk about the importance of family, community and personal responsibility. We do so not because these are an alternative to the market or the state, but because they are more important than the market or the state. The moments that make life worth living are not created by Government, are not announced by Government, are not granted by Government: they come from us as people—our choices, our sacrifices, our efforts—and we believe people should keep more of the rewards of those efforts. Yes, we have taken some corrective action to fund the NHS and get our debt under control, but as we look towards the future I want to say this simple thing to the House and the British people: my goal is to reduce taxes. By the end of this Parliament, I want taxes to be going down, not up. I want this to be a society that rewards energy, ingenuity and inventiveness, a society that rewards work. That is what we believe on this side of the House. That is my mission over the remainder of this Parliament The final announcement in today’s Budget takes a first step. For many of the lowest paid in society there is a hidden tax on work: the universal credit taper withdraws support as people work more hours. The rate is currently 63%, so for every £1 someone earns, their universal credit is reduced by 63p. Let us be in no doubt: this is a tax on work—and a high rate of tax at that. Organisations as varied as the Trades Union Congress, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Resolution Foundation, the Centre for Policy Studies, and the Centre for Social Justice have all said it is too high. So, to make sure work pays and help some of the lowest-income families in our country to keep more of their hard-earned money, I have decided to cut this rate, not by 1%, not by 2%, but by 8%. This—[Hon. Members: “Hear, hear. ”] This is a tax on working people and we are cutting it from 63% to 55%, the rate originally envisaged by my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Sir Iain Duncan Smith). And because I am also increasing the work allowances by £500, this is a tax cut next year worth over £2 billion. Nearly 2 million families will keep on average an extra £1,000 a year. Changes like this normally take effect at the start of the new tax year in April, but we want to help people right now, so we will introduce this within weeks and no later than 1 December Let me tell the House what these changes mean. A single mother of two renting and working full-time on the national living wage will be better off by around £1,200. A couple renting a home with their two children, one parent working full-time, the other working part-time, will be better off every single year by £1,800. This is a £2 billion tax cut for the lowest paid workers in our country. It supports working families, it helps with the cost of living and it rewards work So, fuel duty cut, air passenger duty cut, alcohol duty cut, the biggest cut to business rates in 30 years, growth up, jobs up, wages up, public finances back in a better place, more investment in infrastructure, innovation and skills, a pay rise for over 2 million people, and a £2 billion tax cut for the lowest paid.

I recommend a greater part of the employment board on bill for hunting fees. The committee has discussed the matter and has been contacted by a number of visitors listed in the Committee. We\'ve had 11 meetings on this matter that came in at the end of September and had a guest from 25 parties. Since more than a few people came from each side, there have been extensive and well - discussed on the job committee and on a number of accounts. The bill suggests that a new total fishing fee will be established. In 2012, there have been several changes, and more methods than one have been used to determine the price of fishing. The bill of this suggests that each year\'s currency of hunting costs is based on the elation of the fishing industry on each of its crops. It is suggested that the price rate of cohesion will be 33%, which is the same currency as the current law. It is suggested that fishing be set at the end of each year for the next calendar wound, rather than be determined in August before the coming fishing year. Changes are made to simplify the management of a hunting fee, consisting of largely the work of the Fishing Committee, to the office of the governor of the tax, and also to a special Council Committee on Fishing Costs. The bill also suggests that the so-called holiday target will remain unchanged, i.e. It should be noted that each subject pays 20% of the first 4.5 million. K. The stress of fishing costs and 15% of the next 4.5 million. K. Stress. A greater proportion of them contributes to an adjustment of 6. in order to meet the differences between small and medium-sized companies in the seas, as well as the urban areas. On the basis of current legislation, the calculus of the fishing fee is determined on the basis of tax (EBT) profits in the marine industry, according to the Icelandic Habitat fishing and processing report, calculated for bottom fish and for seawater. Due to the time frame at the publication of the report, this is based on at least two-year-old information. The bill\'s method for the scheme-based decision is designed to facilitate abnormal fluctuations, but the procedure of the current law includes largely dependent on gang swings. According to 3 mg. Section 5. The bill shall be the owners, the managers, and the operators to give a report on income and the costs of fishing ships and their extensions, as detailed in the directive. Codes 90 and 92,◯94. par. the management of income taxes apply to the collection and output of information as appropriate. If information is not submitted, it is insufficient or disgruntled, or it is considered necessary for further information, the local taxpayer should challenge it to replace it. Disregarding the challenge, he calculates income and cost. A fish lab is permitted to provide information to the head of the state tax from financial and tax reports and reports and to be the Office for Ministry on the data provided by the Agency. 5 mg. The same article states that if the calculation of the algorithm was found to be a significant error, it would be permitted to reassign the currency according to Article 4. about the sum of fishing fees to the last two fishing years, although it has been found to be too low. The majority suggest a 3 mg word change. Section 5. and that there is also a requirement for a special fee made by the head of the state tax if income is underestimated or the cost is often reported later on in view. The value of each stock for each fishing vessel is based on information that will be listed in the report on the cost of fish costs and the cost of operating with the tax payer in the marine road. To make this easier for the owner of fishing vessels, the report will be signed when it is opened by tax returns. A specific decision is required to manage the processing of marine ships through the implementation of marine resources and, on the basis of loose comparison to the production of unsuspecting fish in unscheduled fields, to indicate that the storage of frozen fish catchs are reduced by 10%. In addition, the value of all sources of information is suggested to be increased by 10% in these accounts, as available data on bottom-water resources and up-to-date resources are not entirely comparable to those of different species living under both the fishing and the implementation of the target species. This is in effect similar to an arrangement that is in accordance with the current law, which allows for the fishing fees in marine species to be any more abundant than on bottom-fish species, where a larger part of the profit of production of marine resources is contained in the strain. In March 2018, Deloitte\'s accounting agency published a report on the management of marine soil companies according to the joint petition of the marine rights and agricultural ministers and the head of the industry. The report stated that the income in the fishing road has grown to about 25 billion in 2016 or about 9%. Because the loss of income has been partly reduced, especially in larger communities, and if the EBITDA dropped by 15 billion dollars, by 22%. In part, this is due to significant reductions in labor in 2016, less than 19% of the previous year, mainly due to hairy failure. In addition, Deloitte\'s report stated that it was for EBITDA to get quite worse in the management year 2017, including Because of adverse external economic development. In this way, the price of marine products has dropped substantially in the United States and the pay number has increased. The reduction in oil prices has had a positive effect on the survival of 2016, but by 2017, oil prices have refurbished. Thus, the EBITDA repertoire of 2017 may have fallen by 203/437% since the previous year. In recent years, the number of independent fishing drivers in the fishing industry has declined rapidly. According to Fish Room figures, the number of fishing projects with the power of the labor departments has decreased from 946 to 382 from the beginning of the fishing year 2005-03/2006 to the beginning of the current fishing year, i.e. The number of patients that have decreased to less than 60% in 12 years has been reduced. To date, both fishing targets and hook - forces are listed, but the bigst part of this change lies in the small boat structure. At the beginning of the season of the fishing season, the hook - mark boats were 354; at the beginning of the current fishing season, they had reached 258. So it has decreased by a quarter in four years. At the same time, a growing share of 50 of the largest hook - power teams has become 83%. In fact, many hook - bearing subs seem to have little means or no means to operate. In addition to internal and external circumstances, there is likely to be a 2013 law change here, at which point the boat\'s size was lifted from 15 bridges to 15 meters maximum and 30 grosstons, increasing demand for a hook - up point. A building agency has examined changes in the survival of some marine export companies involved in the implementation of the Agency. Their income dropped substantially between 2016 and 2017. This is in line with the statistics from Iceland\'s Habitats, which believe that the export of marine products between 2016 and 2017 has decreased by more than 15%. This information can likely be applied to other similar size enterprises. Seafood companies vary in size, and their operating conditions vary greatly. In cases where fishing costs become very taxing, and it even adds to difficult business conditions, business needs to respond and adjust. In some cases it can mean sales of fishing warrants, which can cause great difficulties, especially in small TVs where small and medium - sized companies are the weight of a vulnerable sea area that depends largely on the sea streets. At the same time, it is likely to lead to an increase in fishing resources. This is shown in a memo published by the Compulsion Institute. Commenting on the case of the committee, the situation was considered when fishing and production of seafood are being practiced by fishing companies. The trade of such parties, according to the Commission, is a high priority for the price of the stock market, which is generally lower than market prices. Thus, the construction of such a fishing business may be more efficient in competition with unpublished fish farming, as well as by nonfishing fish - producing fishing companies that sell markets have fewer opportunities for business ventures in integrated activities. The Committee discussed the decision of the price of sea forces in cases such as these and questions about price formation and the prognostication of the so - called cover-up, discussed in 57th chapter. a law on income taxes. There was no doubt about options that the government tax manager\'s office has legal requirements, as well as those that the office has access to data to add a price comparison. However, it was also noted to the Commission that the cover is a difficult task, that it may be difficult to find out the right price, especially when it is not too difficult, and that it takes time to go through such a government case. No later than December 1, each year, the national tax manager according to the bill shall make a suggestion for a minister for the sum of the fish for crops. With the bill, the government tax manager\'s office is authorized to take a special look if there is evidence of an abnormal cover-up in an integrated fishing industry or in an integrated marine export company. The majority feel that this is a proper way of dealing with the discussion of these issues on the committee as elsewhere. The majority of these points point out that the prices of a guards at the seamen\'s catch - up market and contributes to the proper and normal production of the seafood market and the work of the seamen according to the law of No. 13/1998, as to the price of the price of the prices and the seamen\'s decision. The majority of them consider it important that the work of a plant be strengthened, pointing to some of the factors involved in the management of the situation, e.g. the need to revise Article 3 paragraph 3 law on sizes and quality categories as well as on expounding authority clearances in Article 6. The law. The committee also noted, first of all, that it was more reasonable to say that the decision of the Guard\'s Office was time again, second, that the Price Room could not prevent the sale of certain fish, even though lower prices had been used as a reference to exposé, and third, that the gross size of all boats and ships should be publicly recorded. A comment on the matter was made on the fact that those who earn a brace and there should be paid a bounty to the state by the bill. A major factor points out that only a part of innovation is at sea or on the grid. Also, the majority of the items point out that with a sentence of law No. 49/2017, on the change of various laws because of the amendment of marine eco-efficiency, increased responsibilities on the state\'s institutions were put in charge and researched the thongs and the seawaters. In the treatment of that matter at the council, the Committee called a major part of the current employment committee was called on to say that the purpose of hunting costs was, among other things, meeting the costs of research, monitoring, etc. It was also repeated that studies were important, including where the fish and the sea were important to the environment. For example, a marine - growing ecosystem research agency was assigned to study the laws of the marine environment. The majority suggest the following changes to the bill: It is suggested that crops with less value than 100 million are used. K. In a year on the average of the three - year - olds, the root of a fishing fee would not be set. The majority believe that fishing costs can influence the motivation to pick up such species. The types that can fall below are e.g. blues, sandwashes, and tattoos, and possibly the scallop. The wording of a 3 mgr is rendered. Section 5. and that there is a new paragraph that will require a specific price to be paid to an employee if he has an understatement or an overdose. This price should be paid regardless of whether an undercalculable income and/or a frequent cost will lead to correction of the price of fishing costs. The adjustment of the 3rd mg regimen is implemented. Section 6. In the event that the first 40% of the first 6 million are off-graded. K. stress for each year. In view of the greater part, the cut-off target needs to be strengthened further, with this adjustment specifically responding to the difficult situation of SMEs, which do not enjoy the size of the big enterprise, but which is creating a large structure in their community. Reduced emissions are much more dependent on exacerbations and have resulted in compression and loss of function and convergence. The change is also proposed to 1st. 7. if referred to the government taxpayer\'s office, but from the end of the year, office collects public pay. The more part suggests that the bill will be agreed with the above proposals made in a special Senate document that I will explain, but under this opinion, the printed page as follows, Lilja Rafney Magnúsdóttir, head of the professional committee and producer, Halla Kristjánsdóttir Kristjándðursson, Ásmundur Friðriksson, Kolbeinn Óttarsson Proppé and Njáll Traust Friðbertsson. The adjustment proposal reads to a bill for more part of the labour board on fishing fees: 1st At Section 3. Add a new paragraph, as follows: Necessary stocks with a value value of less than 100 billion. K. In a year on the average of the three - year - olds, the root of a fishing fee is not made up of them. 2. Five o\'clock. a. Instead of that word, at 3 mg, the word ""politicals "" was used in the first century B.C.E. Come on, let\'s go. b. Add a new paragraph as price four. mgr., as follows: If you experience a review of an article that can be found in 3 mg. that it is incorrectly filled out so that income is seriously underestimated, or the cost frequently often is often high, the head of the Treaty should add a special price to 5% of the underdeveloped income level and/or the above costs. This should be paid regardless of whether an undercalculable income and/or a number of costs will lead to correction of the base of the fishing fee. It does not matter that correction is made later than the proposal for a minister on Article 4. The decision by the head of the head of the tax on the stress of this fee is charged to the head tax Committee, as is the law of No. 30/1992. c. Instead of the word ""shutstourgs "" at 4 mg. come: it is required. 3. 1st matter of 3 mg. Section 6. Puts it this way: During the pressures of hunting fees, only 40% of the first 6 billion should be used. K. each year\'s stress for each currency. 4. Instead of the word \'tollman,\'1st mg. 7. Come on, state tax manager. 5. Instead of the reference, ◯7.How\'s it going to be? three-mgr. Section 8. Come on, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all, y\'all. 6th The abbreviation ""Environous"" of the 10th paragraph. ... goout. This is the way it sounds a word--not a holy word but--I know it. [[The Claus of the Assembly Hall.]] [[The Holy Word?]] [[Laughter at the Hall of Congress.]] [[Up front.]] I know this is very important and almost sacred, but there are some things that can\'t be changed when it\'s good. [[The point is, it just can\'t be changed.]] However, much work has been done, and much consultation has taken place within the committee at this point since our discussion. I believe that there were views that were made clear about the concern of men of high fishing fees for these small and medium-sized enterprises that developed 200%, even a 30% increase in fish fishing year, 2017,2018. This has led to an even greater compression, and many men are trying to dry up their thirst in the hope that this part of their management spending will reflect their well - being. In this bill, we also extend our hunting expenses in a very sensitive way. We are achieving what has actually been accomplished since 2012 when the fishing fees were applied, which were more extensive than the fishing costs set in 2004, which were primarily aimed at the research of the Marine Research Institute in the ocean and marine life. In 2012 the fishing fees were revised, the total fishing fees were tried, and the article sought to get more out of the way. But what was missing was to obtain information as far as time is concerned and then to place food - related fishing costs, that hunting costs could swing, rise or fall, according to the survival of the article each time. Information on valuables came from Fish Labs, and the government tax manager receives specific information on the interests of the seafood companies and products. This can be set up and found algorithms for the recovery of any species, which, in turn, means whole over; 33% of this algorithm strain will then be applied to the application of the alpha wound afterwards. The government tax manager will then contribute it to the late part of the year to the minister compared with the information that has been prepared for the so called. I think all classes have spoken of extending the maximum demand in real time and we have arrived there. Then it is a political decision each time whether we have 33% of the calculus or more. It will always be a political decision. But the methodology that such as that, I believe, I have arrived at a place where we should, wherever we stand, be able to write on it. If we want to keep the cost of living, we will have reached it as far as possible in real time as possible with the outcome of this article. It is then another arm that this small and medium-sized enterprise is elsewhere than this largest company with a lot of resources on its own. Therefore, we have suggested that they be met by a greater proportion of the employment authorities with these extra payoffs, and we press them at the bottom of which they most benefit from these small and medium-sized enterprises, benefit them, and will make a big difference to them. The committee learned on Thursday was with the U.S. subboat owners who were very comfortable with this methodology that they were pressing support for those who really needed it and would relieve many of the concerns that were not seen in the operating field compared to the same fishing fee. Since this has been done very well in my opinion, I am amazed that here is a suggestion to dismiss the case, dismiss the case, and suggest that the same fishing fee be done next year, that we live the same law that we have seen to be maligned, based on two or three years of information. As if that were to be dismissed, we are talking about the next year\'s Almanac River, the fishing fees may be 12.5 billion. Then I think it will be useful to a number of communities that will depend on that fishing fee, this small and medium-sized company, so the next year, the fishing rate could fall to 2.5 billion or less, based on reimbursement of two, three years back in time. Is this what they want? Or is it making some kind of change in plans to change the fishing system, changing plans for hunting costs? You can\'t tell what\'s going on. Council members who have spoken about the importance of making consultation and building on good preparation with all relevant parties and consultations within the council. If the program proposal is not accepted, to dismiss the case, I assume those who made the adjustment would agree to accept this bill with these changes. Where, then, will the discussion take place? Where do you get all the work done there? Where\'s the good work there? What are they talking about there? Is this poopulism into one thing or what responsibility is behind such a project that in hunting fees people are going to change the laws about the government of fish fishing? I\'m just gonna do it between 2 and 3. ... awrong.? I don\'t understand this kind of work and language done by people I thought should be responsible, people who talk about and call for responsibility in this case to others who have tried to win this case very well, and called in everyone who\'s been asked to cover this case, they work with a number of parties, and they\'ve got lots of references, but now, without being called after consultation, reviews, or whatever, to go after the wet dreams wet dreams we built, and the Coalgains to offer up all the resources in the next 20 years. [[Take it up and Pirata.]] And Pizza. They are now the liberal groups assembled in a chorus. It\'s amazing. If this is not being the case, the large structure of the so - called left Party, the United States, and the Piranium is about to go to this auction, which will only result in further compression in a few years, groups that don\'t want to be on the right or the left - but the restoration always goes forward without a mask and makes others join them. [[The president calls.]] [[Hairsick at the Senate Hall.]] [[Let\'s go, let\'s go, let\'s go, let\'s go, let\'s go, let\'s go, let\'s go, let\'s ……]] [[Laughter at the Hall of Congress.]]', ""A respectable president. The bill on this subject is Pirata's idea of a free hand hunt and I'm going to review the report. The objective of this bill is to improve the situation of coastal fishing not only by taking into account economic and safety issues. Coastal fishing has proved its value to support smaller settlements, to create innovation in the fishing grounds, and to contribute to the diversity of marine resources. The bill suggests that there is a more extended period of time than has previously been done for longboats to reduce the risk of hunting in the weather. Coastal fishing is now equipped with some 650 boats. The different conditions of the country and its application have led to considerable division within the system, yet there has been great interest in fishing. The Hook Summing System is under attack because of changes in the length and volume of small boats, resulting in a large compression within that system. On it. Three years later, the number of boats has decreased by 77 and is now 227, not because of poor fishing boats but because of fishing costs just higher than a small boatman can carry. With a bill this, the plan is to strengthen the platform of small boats for those who do not have a catch mark, as well as economics for small boat sailors. The benefits of the coastal fishing system today are three: First, they match the state of a country that does not follow specific boats. Second, the coastal fishing system contributes to innovation in fishing waters, where the cost of sharing in coastal fishing is less than in the fishing sector. Third, coastal fishing boats burn well within one third of the oil that tugboats to burn by fishing at the same level of fish, nor do they harm the bottom of the ocean by any means. According to a 2009 report, which promises to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in Iceland, more than three times as much fuel as local fishing equipment is reported. So much community and environmental interests are concealed in extending and supporting this system. These changes will reduce demand for markets with increased freedom to commercial sea attendance. It affects the types of projections that hire from source to output that need to meet the local government's demand for contribution to the mobilization of municipal resources. This bill assumes that the change in the treatment schedule and the provision of the resources derived from the source is 5.3% at 3 mg. Section 8. legal about the control of fishing. Such increases do not conflict with discussions about various other systems of 8 grm. is to some extent out - of - date and must be removed. In 1st. are provided for several changes in Article 6. legal about the control of fishing. The length of a beach fishing period is suggested to be extended from four months to eight months. The period is so limited to every boat in a new 8th. 5 mg. Because the period covers the limit of the fishing year, beginning on September 1, each year, this may be interpreted as being two, one from September 1 to October 31, and the other from August 1 to August 31. It is suggested that a minister of advisers, not merely authority, but the amount of money needed to catch the beach. This adjustment enables the wording of the paragraph to measure up to the requirement set out in paragraphs 3 and 5. Section 8. The law. At present, the articles disagree slightly, possibly causing a misunderstanding or opening up to a variety of interpretations. It is suggested that Sunday fishing be authorized. Much has been discussed with the need to allow fishing five days a week. Given the original objective of the coastal fishing system for land management within 24 hours, it is unwise to allow hunting on Fridays that usually do not take place on weekends, even if markets are open. By allowing hunting on Sundays, market sales and management are moving on Monday. It is also suggested that the 5th mg. I'll add five new numbers. New number 7. face to reduce an attack by force. In this case, countries with a range of species other than the one available to fish, or up to 100 kg cod water, will be allowed to exceed the 650 kg allowed according to the 5th count. Same paragraphs. Then there is a tablet that shows the difference in coastal fishing. As you can see from species exchange, the last three lengths of shore fishing usually take place at a direct application of cod. The application of only cod should come to the land of the hunters of some areas allows other species to remain on the outside because of the dose. Thus, an endogenous trigger for evaporation is present. The bill presents a license to take 100 kg by force in other species that are normally ufs. It has more espionage to land, but there are currently evasions used as exchanges in the target system and are not really new. Thus, at the end of a fishing year, it is estimated that this rule does not put sea stocks at risk to any extent. Rather, it contributes to the better use of marine crops and the more efficient markets. New 8. limits the number of days per boat at 50 days across the entire period. This is somewhat comparable to what is permitted to every boat in the present system, where four days a week for 12 weeks last 48 days. However, the number of days in which hunting sites and their offensives have been far fewer than they have already been. 99911. a number. it is intended to generate a fishing vessel but at the same time make it possible to switch from beach fishing to mackerel or gray-free fishing. However, it is not possible to obtain hook-set clearance along with coastal fishing. Two. The bill is suggested to go from 20% to 22% of the fish stock of cod. The target system is determined to remain unchanged and to receive 20% of the total stock of motors, as suggested by the Agency's adviser, but 2% will pass to meet coastal fishing requirements. However, this increase is not expected to be fully replaced for the time being. A report on the use of major crops from June 2011 speaks of an amendment that 22% of the crops stocks under advice of the ICES (International Council for the Exploding of the Sea) and therefore should not be affected by the marketing of Iceland. In the accompanying box, you will find a table that explains the size of our numbers in relation to the previous fishing year. In a new labour policy, cod fishing is expected to increase by 2% of the total stock of cods to a maximum. I emphasize that it is to a climax, for the 9 yous. tons that are in the coastal fishing system do nothing initially, and the real need for boats today is about 21 ys. a ton, i.e. if everyone hunts the peak, which doesn't happen in fishing because fish are fishing, and fish tend to move, and sometimes we don't find it. In such cases, the plan is that, although the number of boats may be increasing, each boat always reaches its limit, but in the early years of coastal fishing, the boats were 700. This seems to be about the maximum number of boats compared to the boats that could be sead in the years to come. The new boat is an expensive vote for fishing, so there are several years before new boats are added to the pots of potential sailors. Where the budget has been applied, both the National Protection Agency and the Marine Research Institute are in Article 4. created a change in the fish price law. It is suggested that a special fishing fee be placed on coastal fishing boats at 10 k. on each land of codskiskis. This provision is aimed at trusting the management base of the Marine Research Agency by supporting the research of bottom-fish populations around the country and new research factors towards the temperature, sale, motion patterns, and separation of different cod populations around the country. For decades these teams have been financed, so the research of the Agency is a child of their time. Marine research agencies have had to be more cautious about their advice on the lack of data and error in studies that could be partially adapted to further data collection and research. Also, the special fishing fee is designed to increase contributions to the DLA, which are also under attack for financial resources. A respectable president. Dear Senator's World. Icelandic people. Today, we are at a critical time. We need to have a positive influence on the development of the country's rights to fish. If that bill is adopted, which I recommend today, of the change in fish control law, it will completely turn people's living conditions into villages and towns all over the country. The present fishing system, the eater system, has been very difficult for many, especially for small TVs. If this bill succeeds, huge steps will be taken to halt the migration from the coastal region and improve the living conditions and employment of the region. By making this bill legalized, we add access to both new and small - boat outputs to the use of the ocean's resources. We're here to put an end to the sale of markets of the largest parties and to promote the competitiveness and employment of rural communities across the country. We're supposed to rebuild our nation's ports. We're supposed to promote fish markets and add raw materials. We're here to meet the settlements of Curfjörður, Stykisholm, Souththing, Florence, Painfrefjord, Patrefrefjord, Chefjordur, Northfjordur, Kopask, Hakvik, Dalvik, Gímíney, Rausfarley, Thorves, Hornfjörður, Vestan Islands, Deserts, and Sandmaker. Farmers who developed and thrived because of their support of commercial fishing grounds, rural areas that have suffered from reduced access to fishing grounds, rural societies that have become the food system, with reduced population size, and decadence. With the bill as it is today, individuals will be enabled to pursue eco-friendly development and fishing without disrupting the lives of the sea. We add access to the raw materials for commercial fishing, a company that was badly affected during a recent fishing strike. There will no longer be a shepherd of Gullveig fishing, who will be able to hunt for a living. The system as it is installed in the bill is a modest approach to what is being done. The Norwegians have similar devices, and the deliveries go a long way. One thing is certain, though, that our human approach to the control of fish that is common in everyday speech depends on the term peddler system for human activity. Laws are human work. So I propose this bill in hopes that, contrary to political parties, we can agree that improvement is needed. Today, these changes are ideal conditions. Fish prices are low at this time, so concern is that half the Icelandic people are caught for fishing. At the same time, active men and women have long fled the country with their small boats made to Norway and the Faeroe Islands. A number of Icelanders have visited in North Noregi and have it really so good that they're expected to return. The knowledge of the waste resources went with them, adding Norway's competitive attitude to Iceland. Dear Senator's World. Here we have the opportunity to undo the damage done to the country's country's construction project. Although that harm will never be satisfied, we have an acceptable solution that serves the interests of innovation and then inhabited in the country. This will put an end to the systematic risk of fishing by those who engage in coastal fishing. It all rhymes with 1st pars. legal about the control of fishing."", 'My Lords, as we are an island nation, our seas are integral to our history, economy and culture, so it is a great privilege to open this debate. A rich diversity of fish and shellfish provides us with nutritious, valuable food and employment. I recognise at the outset the dangers of this harvest: seven lives were lost in 2019, and I pay tribute to the bravery of those at sea and their families Together with the Agriculture Bill and the Environment Bill, this Bill creates a strong and legally binding framework to deliver this Government’s ambition to leave the natural environment in a better state than we inherited it. It is crucial that we are successful. The Government’s vision is to build a sustainable fishing industry, with healthy seas and a fair deal for UK fishing interests. This Bill is a key step towards delivering that vision Fisheries management is complex and requires responsive, science-based policy-making. Data on fish stocks must be gathered and analysed. The safe levels of exploitation of those stocks must be considered, as well as the allocation of those resources and the granting of rights to use them. On top of this are technical rules on matters ranging from the use of types of fishing gear to minimum landing sizes of species—all required to allow the harvest of our fish while avoiding damage to stocks and the environment The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ensures that the existing legislative framework to manage our fisheries remains in place after the transition period. Along with earlier pieces of fisheries legislation, this Bill gives us the powers needed to manage our fisheries more effectively in future, ensuring that we can meet our international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—UNCLOS—and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement—UNFSA—and become a global leader in fisheries management as befits our island nation The Bill’s objectives for sustainable fisheries management ensure a UK-wide framework to manage the fish that live in UK waters. We have worked closely with the devolved Administrations in developing this framework to ensure that our approach fully respects the devolution settlements, while recognising that we have a shared responsibility to protect our marine environment and to support a thriving industry across the UK. The Bill provides the powers to manage and support the recreational sea fishing community too, as well as the commercial sector First and foremost, this Bill confirms in law our commitment to environmentally, economically and socially sustainable fishing. Healthy fish stocks are the basis of a thriving and profitable fishing industry. We must therefore ensure that we apply science-based management approaches both to the benefit of the environment but also, crucially, to the long-term profitability of our fishing industry This Bill takes and reforms the EU’s sustainable fishing objectives and commits to a new, ambitious set of UK objectives, which are in the Bill. These include a climate change objective, to ensure that the impacts of the fishing industry on climate change are minimised while ensuring that fisheries management adapts to a changing climate; objectives to further the collection of scientific evidence across the Administrations and to take the precautionary approach to fisheries management in the absence of such evidence; and the national benefit objective, which seeks to ensure that a benefit to the UK is felt as a result of UK boats fishing stocks from UK waters—the first time such a requirement has been included in our legislation The Bill requires the Government and devolved Administrations to set out in a joint fisheries statement how we will together contribute to the achievement of the objectives. Our intention is for all policies that achieve the objectives to be included in the joint fisheries statement. There is, however, a provision in the Bill to allow the Secretary of State to set out reserved or non-devolved policy in a Secretary of State fisheries statement The Bill includes the requirement to produce fisheries management plans, alongside the devolved Administrations where appropriate, delivering on our manifesto commitment. These plans will set out on a stock-by-stock or fisheries basis our plans for achieving the sustainability of those stocks. The plans go further than we have gone before in relation to stocks, for which assessing sustainability is much harder. Many of these are valuable shellfish stocks. The plans commit us, in those circumstances where we do not have the scientific data to assess their health, to develop the scientific evidence base on which we will then be able to do so. The fisheries statements and the fisheries management plans will be legally binding The Bill also extends the powers of the Marine Management Organisation and the devolved Administrations to protect the marine environment, strengthening them so that they can be used to restore and enhance, as well as conserve, the marine environment. Secondly, the Bill creates the powers that the UK needs to operate as an independent coastal state and fulfil our international obligations. From 2021, the UK will be an independent coastal state, able to control who can fish in our waters. We will be responsible for setting annual total allowable catches of fish species within our waters. For stocks that are shared with other coastal states such as the EU and Norway, we will negotiate to agree fishing quotas. Currently, the EU distributes quotas between its member states using a principle called relative stability, which provides a fixed percentage of quota based on fishing patterns from the 1970s. This gives an unfair share of quota to UK fishers, not reflective of what is found in UK waters, and so we will negotiate to move towards a fairer, more scientific method for the allocation of shared stocks The Bill will put in place the powers we need to operate as an independent coastal state by allowing us to set fishing opportunities and to determine which vessels may enter our waters. Any decisions about giving vessels from the EU and any other coastal states access to our waters will be a matter for negotiation. This Bill provides the framework to enable us to implement whatever is agreed internationally. For example, it ensures that should we negotiate access to our waters, vessels from other coastal states will have to hold a licence. This is equitable and ensures a level playing field between UK and foreign boats Enforcement in UK waters is a devolved matter, and each fisheries administration is responsible for control and enforcement in their waters. In England, the Marine Management Organisation has assessed, and continues to assess, the levels of enforcement capacity required for fisheries protection and the options for best delivering this. It is undertaking a significant increase in the number of personnel and surveillance assets relating to fisheries protection, with a sizeable increase in support, much of which is already in place. We are committed to continuing to work closely with our neighbours to ensure the sustainable management of shared fish stocks Thirdly, the Bill introduces powers to make reforms to our fishing industries across the Administrations, while respecting the devolution settlements. Many of the regulations that form the common fisheries policy will be retained as part of UK law, providing legal certainty to fishers at the end of the transition period. It is right that while the Bill gives us the powers to move away from this law, we make evidence-based changes The management of fisheries is devolved and this Bill respects that. Officials from the devolved Administrations have been closely involved in the development of the provisions in the Bill. I am pleased to say that the Bill reflects this joint working by legislating on behalf of the devolved Administrations in some areas, at their request. In most cases, the powers provided are equivalent to those provided for the Secretary of State in the Bill, within the devolved Administrations’ competence The dynamic nature of our fisheries, and the importance of keeping pace with scientific developments, mean that both the Government and the devolved Administrations, at their requests, need powers to amend the highly technical regulations governing rules such as the size of fishing nets or the grading of fish, and to amend measures so that we can control aquatic animal disease Beyond this, the Bill creates new schemes to help fishing fleets thrive across the UK. These include broadening grant-making powers, creating powers for England and Wales to tender some of the additional quota received after we become an independent coastal state, and establishing a new scheme to help the fishing industry comply with the landing obligation in England The Bill also makes a technical correction to the Welsh devolution settlement by extending the competence of the National Assembly for Wales in relation to fisheries in the Welsh offshore zone, from 12 nautical miles to 30 nautical miles at its greatest extent. The Welsh Government previously devolved Executive responsibilities in this area These new powers for the four fisheries administrations ensure that the fishing industry across the UK can be supported appropriately. However, in some areas, it makes sense to continue having a common approach. The Bill creates common approaches where the Government and the devolved Administrations have agreed this is necessary—for example, a joint approach to managing the access of foreign vessels through licences given by the single issuing authority I am pleased to say that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee published an exceptional and highly positive report relating to the powers contained in the previous Bill. We await its report into this Bill with considerable interest. It should be noted that there are no additional delegated powers contained in this Bill, beyond the extension of some powers to the devolved Administrations, at their request. It is important that we are clear to your Lordships and the other place on precisely what these powers are about, why some of them are extremely technical and why it is important that we take advantage of them as we have more technological advances. Where we have legislated within devolved competence, we have sought legislative consent from the devolved legislatures. Our objective is to ensure that the fishing industry across the UK is supported and can thrive under the governance of the relevant fisheries administration The Bill puts sustainability at the front and centre of our future fisheries management policy. It sets us on a path to building a sustainable and profitable fishing industry, with healthy seas and a fair deal for UK fishing interests. Importantly, it respects and enhances the devolution settlements, giving the devolved legislatures more powers and responsibilities than they have ever had. It will allow us to control access to our waters by foreign fishing boats, and, for the first time in 45 years, to place equitable rules on them while they are in our waters A sustainable harvest of our waters is our objective. The objectives in the Bill make the direction of our future policy abundantly clear. The future of our fishing fleet is intrinsically bound up with the vitality of the marine ecosystem. There are noble Lords here who have considerable experiences of fisheries, some as former Fisheries Ministers. Seafaring and fishing the seas have a very long history, and many in the fishing fleets feel that they have not been cared for. This is an opportunity for us all to ensure prosperity for this important British industry. I emphasise that this will be possible only if we are, above all, wise custodians I beg to move.']","<|system|>

45,189,45_women_violence_police_sexual,"['women', 'violence', 'police', 'sexual', 'gender', 'children', 'equality', 'hate', 'rights', 'media']","['women', 'violence', 'police', 'sexual', 'gender', 'children', 'equality', 'hate', 'rights', 'media']","[""Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, last Sunday was the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, established in 1999 by the UN General Assembly. It was chosen on November 25, because on that date, in 1960, three of the four Dominican sisters Mirabal were killed, because they were guilty of rebelling against the dictatorship of Trujillo. Their code name was mariposas (butterflies) and they were beaten to death. Since then much has been done in Italy and around the world to overcome the culture of prevailing masculinism that pervades our society. I will mention here the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women adopted in 1979 by the UN Assembly, which entered into force in 1981 and ratified in Italy in 1985, which, among other things, set up a committee to monitor the state of application of the rules for the protection of women's rights. I would also like to mention the 2011 Istanbul Convention, which for the first time created a comprehensive framework for women's protection, which is legally binding at international level. This Convention, which was ratified in the last parliamentary term (in 2013), introduced amendments to the penal code and the criminal procedure code, invoking penalties - among other things - for crimes against women. Despite this, despite the preparation of the Action Plan against Gender Sexual Violence, foreseen by the Convention last mentioned, and despite the Extraordinary Action Plan adopted by decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of 7 July 2015, the data on crimes against women in our country are terrifying. Over the last ten years 1,750 feminicides have been committed, more than 150 per year, almost one every two days; and the vast majority of these have occurred in family contexts. In 2017 alone there were more than 2,000 final sentences for sexual violence and more than 1,800 for stalking. Innumerable then are the complaints for ill-treatment and injury; and this is only the tip of the iceberg, since the statistic attests that in nine out of ten cases the victim does not press charges. It is clear that these figures are the result of a culture that has not yet fully reckoned with the tendency of us men to prevaricate over women. Violence is only the most serious and most evident expression of the phenomenon: sexist insults or the tendency to entrust women with less important and less paid jobs are also part of this same problem. Yet women are the pillar of our society, if only because they are still mainly devoted to the education and growth of our children; we must take care of them. Our country is certainly obliged to take all the necessary measures to prevent all acts of violence against women's rights and to guarantee an effective gender equality - I would say absolute - that are expressed in a total equality of rights, in an equal opportunity to choose the type of life that a woman decides to live, in the most total autonomy and independence, despite her children. It is not fair for a woman to be constantly fought and blackmailed between seeking her place in society and being a mother. The choice to make only the mother or not to do only that must be a free choice; every disparity of economic treatment must be contrasted and fought, because it affects the independence of the woman and thus exposes her to the risk of abusive behavior. In order to do this, it is necessary first of all to change our mentality, which is still decidedly masculinistic. To understand at what point our society is poorly prepared to reject episodes of gender abuse, just remember that even in this House, in the last legislature, some senators have turned to colleagues with vulgar sexist gestures or epithets as vaiassa, which in Neapolitan means servant, squire. In this parliamentary term, I listened to a colleague shout in this Chamber to one of our senators: Back to the kitchen. Unfortunately these insults are transversal, no Group is exempt, they all involve: it is a cultural issue. It is clear that such a climate is indicative of an unsolved problem, as the latest report submitted to the Government in July 2017 by the Committee constituted by the 1979 UN Convention mentioned earlier, which indicated some of the shortcomings of our system. This report made it clear that, first and foremost, women's awareness of their rights and remedies should be strengthened to denounce violations. This report also shows that there is a lack of coordination between regional and local components and a clear definition of mandates and responsibilities. More, and above all, there is a need for decisive action on school, in order to eliminate discrimination through gender equality education from early childhood. This government, since its establishment, has begun to act to overcome such problems. I would like to remind you that yesterday the Council of Ministers, with the idea of strengthening Law No 119 of 2013, approved the so-called red code against violence against women. This is a rule that will shorten the time taken to respond to women's complaints about ill-treatment, sexual violence, persecutors and injuries related to family contexts or cohabitation. The preferential channel already provided for in Law No 119 will be strengthened: the complaint will have to be immediately brought to the attention of the prosecutor, who will have very close time (only three days) to hear the complainant. In addition, the judicial police will have to give priority to their investigations. However, the Movimento 5 Stars, which - let us remember with pride - has the highest percentage of female members compared to any political force ever [[Applause from the M5S Group]] , asks that it be done even more on this front. That is why, with our motion, we call for the Government to ensure that the funds currently allocated are paid out regularly, without delay, and that they are bound to assume precise commitments, giving priority and evaluating the results. We also call for indicators to be provided for assessing the impact of appropriations. We ask that a section be prepared, within the website of the Department for Equal Opportunities, to make the reporting of funded activities accessible: not a single euro must be wasted. We also call for the mapping of anti-violence centres to be updated, including to estimate needs and adjust their allocation. And more: we call for initiatives to be taken in the field of school, educating on equality and defining guidelines that provide guidance to include in school curricula the issues of education on legality and the fight against violence against women. We ask, again, that a path be taken that leads to initiatives of formation of the operators of the justice, the Forces of the order and the social services in order to face the phenomenon; that specific routes be provided in prison for the perpetrators of sexual violence and the exploitation of the prostitution, including the destination of part of the income in favor of the compensation of the victim, and that the victims of crimes such as the exploitation of the prostitution can be inserted in paths, in order to definitively break the bond with the exploiters. We therefore call on colleagues to approve this motion and on the Government to commit themselves to these objectives, so that all Italian mariposas, all butterflies that rebel against injustices, no longer suffer violence or discrimination. [[Applause from the M5S Group and Senator Rufa]]"", 'Mrs. President, the members of the table, the lords and ladies of the government who are in action, the members of the legislature, all of you who have come here as guests to-day, my audiences, good morning. I am a woman, like the majority of this legislature, more than half of humanity. But that\'s not the point. I\'m a feminist. We\'re feminist. That\'s the main thing. Our government will be a feminist, the guarantee of a vital project, the permanence of life being placed in the centre of public politics in order to arrange a new pattern. A culture of another government, because there is no social cohesion, no justice, no democracy, if we cannot attain a new administration which is not founded on equality. Because there is no democracy in a country where half the people are dissected. Equality must be the basis of development, peace, and security, as the Union calls it. And our government will be a left-handed government, a government of liberty and equality, of all the citizens, without leaving any one behind it. The union of the people will be an axis, especially that of the weakest, and that of generation which we shall emphasise. It will be the government of hope and courage, XXI. the government of the century, and not of fear or despair. They tried to frighten us and make us desperate, but we won\'t give up. It will be a government that will work for peace and mutual life, a government that will continue to assist the present age to end, and who will proclaim truth, justice, and rebellion to all who have suffered violence. Besides, the Government will be favorable to the independence of this people. The Basque Country has assembled today-the only force which aims to begin with independence at once. And we will do all we can to bring this people into the path of independence. We want independence, and we need it, because it\'s the only chance we can live in a decent and just country, because we have to be free to live better. It will be an eucalycan government that unites us all because we\'re in Basque Country. It will be a government that will establish the rights of the Basque tongue, and which will give real opportunities to the people who have not yet come near the Basque Sea, because our language will open to them new universes, and they will discover that those new universes will be wonderful. We ought to be citizens of the community, citizens of euscal, healthy and healthy people, who live in a healthy and healthy environment, because justice and solidarity are the right to live happily, happy and free for that reason. This is the great goal of EH Bildu: a cultured and prepared society, a just and supportive country of free men and women, a healthy and healthy citizenship that takes care of its environment to bequeath it to future generations. In short, a people of solidarity and free people, because only by being free can we aspire to be happy and conquer the future we deserve. You know that during the election campaign, before citizens voted, we did put all the cards face to face, we offered the Basque Nationalist Party and Elkarrekin We can form a government around three major axes of action: social justice; peace and coexistence; and the democratic right to decide our future. Now it couldn\'t have been, but our offer is still standing. Our hand continues to stretch out because we think it\'s possible and the future will show that it\'s the only way out. Because a very large majority of citizens wants to have an agreement with three of those three ideas or main axes. If we only play the small one, we\'ll have a chance to win a few drops, but we\'ll have to play the big one if we want to win the tournament. It\'s a great honor and a great responsibility that the men and women of the Basque Country have entrusted me to the presidential president of Eusk0. And I wouldn\'t want to miss the opportunity right now to mention the Oral. The Spanish Government wrote a script without any shame, because the Spanish Justice had not allowed him to run for it. He is the victim of an injustice this important day among us. And I would like to remind you of all the citizens of Esscals, who have been the victim of injustice, before they go on. We can\'t forget them and we won\'t forget them. All except for one. Today\'s session has also been conducted in a special way. And when I say this, I want to remember, too, the women who are constantly attacked by the malxist violence, the men who have rejected this economic crisis and plunged them into unworthy conditions of life, the thousands of people who die daily in the Mediterranean, and who are at their end in shameful conditions of life, and who compose false discourses about them. Gogoan izan behar genuke gu ere egon gaile haien tokian. Polixene Trabudua ekintzaile jeltzaleak, ""Articles of Amama"" Liburuan said: ""The exiles are not from anywhere, since when they are in their land they yearn for their exile, and when they are in this, they want to return to the first."" So my first words today, both on one side and on the other, are directed to people who are having a bad time in this crisis of civilization. In any part of the world, or in the Basque Country, all the people who are oppressing human rights, the oppressed, the forsaken, the prisoners, all the people who can feel that no one is. A feminist government, so I told you. A government which can protect and guarantee the rights of the social and economic majority of our people, and which will render them superfluous. It is necessary that the public power should encourage the integrated policies which ought to be effected in the midst of the crowd, in order to build a cult, a critarian, and a fairer one. Government will be favorable to all women and men, which will be founded on real affinities. That\'s why it\'s got to be shared, really shared. It\'s true, right now, that we\'re women in our goal, but not alone. They\'re on the edge of all the dynamics that cause differences, and we have to look at them, all the workers of oppression. Ladies, girls, more prepared than ever, but we\'ve been born to be guardians, and recently. And this, when we are full of labour in worthy employments, leaves the way of preparation and wisdom, in many cases at least so. That\'s why we have to place the surveillance policy in the center of public politics, in order to organize a people-based economic system. The formal equality in the political institution is still questionable, and we must conclude that personal equality is political, because this is the only way we reach higher associations. In the ideological cult, we must encourage the presence of women in all areas, by special strength in creation, by breaking images which are identified as objects in the media, by more steps in education as to the equality of rights and opportunitys between sexes, by breaking stereotypes, and in the expressions of culture we meet in the everyday, by preventing the continual violation of woman\'s rights rights. We\'re a secondary citizen, and we\'re not secondary citizens. It follows from this, that every day we suffer the most violent, most visible violence, and almost universal censure, but which every day sustains. We all work out the measure, and I think that we all agree in it is urgent. We\'ll go out, we\'ll go out the streets the day after tomorrow, but ladies and women, as the final investigations of the results, we\'ll still get scared. The data in general is to be truly feared. On a terrible examination made by the European Union in 2014, one of three women is exposed to physical violence or sexual violence in Europe. At work, at home, at every age, on every social level, and on 97% men are made. These women are our daughters, they are our sisters, they are our sisters, they are our friends, they are our women, they are our lovers. ""First of all, the female of the world, the capitalists, the native women who smell of land, white, yellow, black, black, black, black, I\'ve got them all, I love them all."" Those are the words of the writer who has just won the Basque Literature. Let\'s all be an accomplice to change this horrible situation. Fear is over, the women have become powerful, for we must now acquire a change. For this reason, we see the necessity of making an integral law against the machista of violence, which we propose to do, in order to give a quick answer to the most urgent. But we do not wish to forget the everyday, as I have said, and to place the feminist policy in the presidency with all that it contains: education, health, media, culture and economic point of view. We need to promote an association between the results, the feminists, the administration, and the social unions, and the necessary direct measures, and the measures which this legislature has taken. The Government must be the guarantee against all kinds of inequality and discrimination, also to which thousands of people suffer every day for their sexual orientation: homophobia, lesbians and transphobia. We will present both bills to guarantee freedom and sexual diversity in an integral way, in addition to recognizing gender self-determination. This determined attitude towards equality will be of great help to advance also as a society, to make a developed country, a peaceful country, a country that believes in social justice. By eliminating inequalities, we can continue to take steps to ensure the necessary intergenerational solidarity and to understand that the problems of others are also our problems. For, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that the situation is not easy, it is not in the Basque Country or in the world. Globalization, right Liberals, and neoliberai, which sought to sell as a remedy for humanity, has entered the crisis before its end is attained. He wanted to be a new way of managing capitalism and left millions of men in misery, not only in the peripherys of the system, but in Africa, Asia, or South America. Globation has damaged the domestic houses, the workers who live in the centre of the system, who persuaded them that they were middle classes, all over the world and here in the Basque Country, bending their conditions from top to bottom, and above all increasing their differences, making richer and poorer. And today the young people, even though they\'re the most prepared generation ever, are working for the poor sodal. It\'s impossible or very difficult to get a place. If they decide to have children, they can even get back to 40 years. They have a dark future for when they grow old, and they do not know that they will be able to collect a pension, and, seeing their wages, they can even see that this pension will be very limited. And in general all this has stolen their hopes, in general all this has stolen from us hope, the right to be happy. And people are angry and angry, and seeing that the economic-finites do not endure such a thing, that the differences grow larger and larger. And this anger is boiling and beginning to overflow. If we look into the world, we can see it everywhere, and we will need to consider the causes, understand and try to solve them; but we can see everywhere that the situation has begun to swell and rise. Here in Europe we have elections in a few days in Austria, where the far right can reach the presidency of the Republic. In Hungary already governs the – let\'s call it that – authoritarian right. In Spain... then we\'ll talk about Spain later. Italy votes next week in a referendum, which will show people\'s tiredness. And Europe, some cry, Europe! Europe. But what Europe? The Europe that distills xenophobic dyes, advancing the vote to the Brexit and adding the vote to the Brexit? The one who has condemned generations of men and women in Greece to misery? The one that throws people out of their homes, while injecting billions and millions of euros into their banks, like in Spain? The one that deals with Turkey and closes her eyes to human rights violations? Europe with banks and electrics? Europe, actually, we like it too, but we\'re beginning to see signs in Europe too. Next year in France, Marine Le Pen is supposed to be at the Elisha, or Fillon, and I\'d say, ""What a pair of caracolas and slugs."" Anger swells and we\'re watching the results. The absolute priority for Euskal Herria Bildu is that Basque citizens live better, live as they deserve, and that among all of us we are able to transform this society socially and economically, so that we reach greater levels of well-being. We are faced with great challenges and also with great difficulties, among other things because we do not have in our hands all the instruments necessary to move forward. We cannot legislate freely, we cannot make sovereign decisions, and the push of this people is again and again colliding with measures that are imposed on us, which we have not decided here. And we believe that this situation must be brought to an end. To begin with, however, it is necessary that we do not go down the slope, we must turn round, and there must be so many measures which have come to us from Spain, and which have here been taken. That\'s why we\'re proclaiming a country without a murmur. We\'re trying to guarantee the right of worthy and secure office, 52 people have died in the Basque Country this year. Pentium, a society that will guarantee social welfare, we wish to secure it by providing to all the citizens a decent life, and avoiding society with a gradual increase. And it\'s going to be a job for the Basque Country to be one of the prioritys and obsessions of the United States. To a person who wants to work and cannot work, the same dignity is denied, and that cannot be accepted. As it is not possible to do the work, but to collect poor wages and live under the level of poverty thousands of people who are working. In this sense, we think it inevitable that the stage in which the law of the Spanish Land Reformation proposes should be removed. We must face it, we must make our own laws to this people. Administrations can do much for employment, of course much more than they do. In Europe, every hundred people who work, twenty-one do so in the public sector. If we were to reach that level, we could create 40,000 new jobs in the public administration; 40,000 new jobs between firefighters, nurses, forest guards, engineers, electricians, administrative... For example, we could recover the 3,000 jobs lost in Osakidetza during the years of the crisis. And besides placing people working in public areas on European level, we can see that for the next four years we can create 20,000 jobs in private, bringing the rate of unemployment around 7% for 20 years. In order to do this, the entire and integrated manufacturing plan must be started, founded on investigation, and aided by politics must be modified from top to bottom. Indeed, recruitment in the private sector should be encouraged, but with criteria of social effectiveness. The Administration can help private companies with money, but it must demand guarantees that such aid will be reversed in society. But I say that it is not just having a job; it is also that they pay you decently for it: 1,200 euros, 1,200 euros per month should be the minimum wage. 1200 euros a month. This is our proposal, a proposition which ought to be least in public, and even the most uncontradicted. 1,200 euros, to ensure a decent life for the workers. And doing 35 hours a week, we\'d win something. The action of private armies will be more difficult, but the administration has some levers in its hands which can produce the results of it, and the least of them is not the contraction of the public. Because it is possible to act upon me by public opposition, because it is possible to influence the equality of men, because it is possible to promote employment, and to encourage it, as well as the use of euphora, or even to direct the attention of environment. We must especially protect our youth, and older people as well, but we certainly cannot have pensioners who cover EUR 400 a month. And we have about 25,000. And you know perfectly well what the light company charges a month, or what the gas company charges, or what the phone charges, or what you have to pay in the contribution or the scale fee. And it turns out that pensioners have to get dressed, they even have to eat, and they often want to give their grandchildren a five-euro pay. Summon, and tell them then that 400 euros is not bad either, and that less is nothing. That must end, and it must end now: EUR 1,080 as a minimum pension, which is 60% of our country\'s average salary, that is Euskal Herria Bildu\'s proposal; a feasible proposal that would affect about 160,000 of our compatriots, who are those who do not come to that amount right now. We see in 1 080 euros that pensioners can live a decent life. To reach that road, and beyond that. That\'s why we want to make an agreement to ensure decent pensions to be able to do it on the table. On the other hand, we will take steps to create a system of our own Euscalis, on the other hand, and attempt to enable us to continue our work until we have all been in our power to take possession of our own social security. The differences are getting more and more distinct here in the Basque Country. He\'s resurviving economics, but he\'s not coming back the same way for everyone. As I have said, there are people who can live in a decent way, but there are people who live in misery, there are people who have neither work nor money, and there are people who can\'t light the stove. That\'s the reality of our town. And in front of this we could do two things: try to ignore it or fix the situation. We have a society that is about to go at two speeds, with people living more or less dignifiedly, and people living with great difficulties. And it\'s very easy, too easy to get into trouble overnight because of some unforeseen situation, or even to run out of absolutely nothing. Talking about social emergency is not an alarmist expression; it is a reality. We can close our eyes and think that elsewhere they are worse, or we can take action. Measures for Euskal Herria Bildu to go through reforming the Income Guarantee Act, so that it can reach all those in need, leaving behind the cuts of the administration of the Socialist Party that then maintained the administration of the Basque Nationalist Party. The word RGI must necessarily speak of Professions. It must be a necessary public instrument to promote employment, but it has wandered and wandered from beginning to first, and has not been effective, and you have admitted that even in this Parliament before now. He has spent the largest of his work and the orientation and range of labour which he needs priority, in order to ensure his incomes, has not been made by form. Moreover, the model for jobs system that we want is not defined. The work, then, is better and indispensable to do so as soon as possible. And this income must be completed with the creation of the basic income for childhood and adolescence. We cannot pretend to have young entrepreneurs and preparers if they have been living in misery during childhood. As it will be difficult to count on the talent and know-how of thousands and thousands of people who are forced to leave their jobs to care for someone in their home, thousands of caregivers, who are also mostly caregivers. Caretakers of children, elderly people, people with problems; caregivers for whom the greatest reward is a smile or a hug from the person they care for. That work, perhaps the most worthy of work, and of course the most selfless, deserves and needs greater recognition than it has so far. Sooner or later, all of us will need someone to take care of us, and our administration must not, of course, forget these people. All this requires deep changes: changes in the administration, change in the budget, but above all, it requires cultural changes, cultural changes. The goal is to leave behind the social state of emigence and transition to a new model of social protection, which will not forget the change of culture based on conversation and association, and the solidarity of generations. Solidarity, that\'s the value of the left. We don\'t like charity in public politics. Solidarity is something else. Each gives the people what they can, whether in money or in his talent, or in knowledge or learning, share together, knowing that one day he himself will receive the protection and satisfaction of the people. The neighbourhood is our old institution, and let\'s not lose sight of it. The neighborhood and solidarity will be the main way we do it. Especially to the people of age, to women, to young, to old people... It is impossible to govern, without listening to the necessity of the public, or paying any attention to them. And in this respect, socially, it is absolutely necessary that we should arrive at honest interviews and negotiations for everyone\'s sake. This conversation will be voluntary to develop the Basque frame for working purposes. It is necessary that the unions and corporations should speak to each other, and it is necessary that the Administration should speak to all of them and find some settlements. The least representative of the majority is not forgotten, but the majority is particularly attentive to those who represent it. In that sense, the Basque Country is absolutely incomprehensible to the United States, and will try to revolutionize this situation with the protection of the Unification of the peace of the peace and the agreement obtained by the Confebasss and UGT and Comissions when there is no restricted agreement. It\'s a good instrument to break unionism, and it\'s a very long-term struggle with the workers. It can\'t be that you pay different wages for the same job. It can\'t be an attitude applauded by the administration, and we have to start with a serious social conversation, which, apart from cortoplatisms, will be workers with companies, which will bring scientific, technical, and cultural innovations of this country. It will, indeed, be the principal guarantee of the future of this people, for it will be the study of eupscal high education. An investigation will make us live healthy, and we will succeed in obtaining an inquiry to leave the Basque People worthy of our descendants. This is a great cultural change, but it is necessary. The most advanced people in the world have understood it well, but here we have not understood it so well. In the last four years the investments of development and development have been continually down. 2,6%; 13%; 14th of 1,92, 15th, is in Exodustic if I am not mistaken, 1884. The same way Spain has done. And in the meantime we must mention that things have changed and risen in the European Union: it has grown up there, and if you look at the most advanced countries, it is more than 4% in many places. It is therefore urgent that as a society we assume that it is essential to investigate and innovate, and that resources must be devoted to this. It is not possible that, over the last four years, year after year, we have seen the money devoted to research and development reduced. We must live up to Europe: we are playing with the future. That\'s why, in four years, at least 3% of the money that leads to it. We\'re proposing a deal to do that here today. The new industrial policy, which EH Collect considers as necessary, will therefore have this foundation: the inquiry, the basis, the inquiry. More and more production, better and better products, better and better services every day. We aspire to be leaders in the industrial sector in Europe, and that is why our industrial policy must first change its mindset, then come up with ambitious challenges for the future. And industrial policy, of course, will be the one that defines our country in the next twenty or thirty years. If we look back, we will see that in this too we look more and more like Spain, and that in the years of crisis we have been looking more and more like each other. Our industrial sector needs a great turnaround, and also a push to open up to new productive and business models. Our factories cannot simply make parts designed abroad at a good price, at the cost of lowering the wages of our workers. Nor do we want to be a country of services that do not bring value. That is why, as I said before, it is essential to invest in research and innovation, but we also propose to set up a EUR 800 million fund to develop an industrial regeneration shock plan. We won\'t be able to leave the Basque Country on the world map, and that\'s the way to work that\'s done so much fruit in the Basque Country. Therefore we think it necessary to prepare the law of the Copoperatives. And we can\'t forget the culture of working with so much fruit that we can\'t forget: We can\'t abandon the model of creating and planning our own business, and there\'s been a lot of this in the Basque Country. In a word, the Esscal economy must be based on its industrial sector, one of the strongest bases, and there must be a variety of various and new methods of service and organization around the industrial sector. In every respect, things can be done better, things can be done more valuable, even in the first sector that has been forgotten for years: I was a cattleman, farming. Our peasants, fishermen can\'t have patterns until now. Some have taken great strides, that is true, but others are in danger of disappearing. And agriculture, ranching and fishing, are manufactures too, as culture is an industry. These are our goals, and if we want to see the Basque Country as leader, we need the same land for us and those who follow us, the land, the land, the water, and the wind. Perhaps, except for those who represent Donald Trump and neoliberalism, no one in the world has any doubt that climateal change already occurs, and that we are persons in a great degree responsible for this change; rather, that our social model is responsible for it. The planet is warming up and there\'s going to be some serious change. It will lead deep changes upon economics, bring them upon health, and bring deep changes upon our life. And temptation is often to think that we\'re small and that we\'ll do one thing or the other won\'t be of special importance. How many COs 2 Does the Basque Country, compared to America, Russia or China? It can\'t be an excuse. We must also be world leaders in this Euskal Country area. And this is necessarily the source of strong steps to change our neurotic frame from top to bottom, to start a transition. It\'s impossible to keep up with a frame that directly works against clean and retal energy. And we\'re in that frame again and again, in the frame that Spain imposes on us. The climate crisis is a systems crisis. I have already said that Globation has failed, spreading misery and increasing the difference between rich and poor, and climateal crisis is the result of this. In this case, the citizens of the Basques must restore the means of deciding the policy of energy, and begin the means of deciding the true Hellenic democracy. We\'re in the hands of the multinationals, and they\'d like to be more and more, and that\'s why CETA and that\'s why TTIP are famous. But it\'ll be all right if you give them up too. Today, thanks to research, technological research, our country does not have to be in the hands of the multinational people, and it may be a great chance in this area that the Basque Country should be a very important people. In any case, we propose a law of climate change, because we must begin to leave fossil fuels behind by taking it as a tool for the sake of retended energy. And to make these energy cheaper, we see that it is necessary to create a public institution, as we see it necessary to make EVE, the organization of energy, the organization of the retractable energy. If you put panels on the roof of your house, you can\'t be punished. The people need a right to consume what they produce and to consume. It can\'t be endured, for instance, as we see the windmills standing there, while thermal Plants defile our air, smoking a gas that is naturally expensive by the smoking coal or a combination cycle, and all by pouring carbon dioxidism, so as not to mention the oxine nitrogen. We\'ll ask ourselves why the life despair of those who live in Pasadena Bay is smaller than the men and women who live in the South of Aba. Ask for neuromology services. We\'re not going to start digging earth with hydraulic techniques. This parliament admits the law against failure, even though Spain doesn\'t like it. But we\'ll have to start again, that\'s what we\'re going to do. For instance, they say it\'s a high-speed train around here. For ten years they\'ve been working and there\'s no time to end, and thousands of millions of dollars are already buried, and when it\'s over, we don\'t even know that this train will never come to Hendaia before twenty years ago. Who knows then that we will use other ways of transport or needing trains? I think we must establish a modernity and take time to see how men and women here need it, without a practicalism, because I often feel that there are certain doses of obstinacy when these projects are started. You know, porcelain, coal, past models. Naomi Klein, she\'s become very fashionable now in Spain, but what I\'ve been telling you is a long time ago, has said: ""We have gone too far, and if we go on, we will fall into the pit if not very little. It\'s time to jump over the cliff."" And that\'s our proposition. to leap over the abyss, to transition to a new pattern, to mark the transition gradually, but constantly. I\'ve mentioned the research over and over, since I see that we\'re doing the right thing for the Basque People and the Basque People to live as we deserve. But underneath the investigation, there\'s education, without an excellent education, we won\'t get anything to lead. In the Basque Country, more than 57% of young men have a higher degree of form, a college appetite, or a high-level education. This data of Araba, Bizia, and Gipuzian is still better, 61%. I think London is alone all over Europe. We have the most trained youth we have ever had, the clothes of men and women, and it is really to be rejoiced. But they don\'t really have a chance to make their own life project, because among the young Euscals\' unemployment rates, around 35 to 40%. They want to work and they can\'t. It is almost ten times more than in Germany on certain plains. We are in danger of losing a whole generation, and if the measures are not now taken, it will be useless to claim that it is the individual or collective right of all popular education. This is education: What we understand from birth as an integral process of life, and as a whole, we understand the Basque People in the Union. That\'s why we\'ll have to deal with the collective development of citizens and the development of the Basque People in the future. And this demands the adaptation of our education to new times, and the renewal of our education, beginning with the student\'s wants, for the sake of the professors and of the whole company of Basques. But this is not possible, in our opinion, with the pretty things which are being established to us to-day; for, on the one hand, it is not possible to resist the attacks which we are constantly suffering from Madrid, unless it be the new Hecitrator, or the system of education which may have a translation of it, or of choice. So for all that, we must necessarily place education at the center of the political agenda at this time of law. And that requires everyone to act in a stately way and to be responsible, and to collect the fundamental, firm, and extensive agreement that will be answered in the long term, and efficiency of the everyday. An agreement of basic education written in capital letters. Each of you will ask us to stop looking at his navel and to get a popular deal, to play it with difficulty, effort, and elasticity, but above all to be responsible. As Nelson Mandela said: ""The most powerful tool for the transformation of a society."" The Basque Country is ready for that, and we won\'t let it pass. And even in college, the law we have will be necessary to renew. To offer a better financial fixed position to public college, to push the university together, and again to push the investigation, the basic investigation, the bismic investigation, and even the applied one. Without basic research, no basic research can be applied, no further progress or gain in the future. Sometimes it will seem sterile, and in history it has often been sterile, and they have found them in basura-bags, some of the obsceneness which they found afterwards to be penicillin. There are times when the investment has been rendered sterile, but there is no fruitless inquiry, because the branch, which does not produce immediate fruit, grows early or later, too. Research and development also in the cultural area. Culture is something we\'ve never been able to define very well, but without which we wouldn\'t even be here today. And it must be developed in a climate of genuine freedom, and it must be the subject of special protection. The cultural industry, the creators, the collectives, the small groups that are in our country and that come together to create a choir, to represent a play, that go out to the square to transmit our dances, writers, writers, singers (we will see many and many next week at the Fair of Durango), actresses..., all these people are making country, and all these people deserve our attention. As all the people who have worked in favour of the Basque for many years deserve. Our Government will not only provide an opportunity for everyone to learn Basque free of charge, it will encourage this to happen by encouraging companies to develop plans for learning and using Basque. The Basques, they have a right to live without discrimination, and we have not succeeded in this part of the Basque Country. Education has not succeeded in the young man\'s complete euscalization and the Euscharian Act during the course of many years, there is no excuse for the 100th of the young men not being Basque. And it has not been succeeded in not applying to the young men\'s contact with the Administration, we will not say in their private services. but knowing that the perfect consent is perhaps impossible, we must take strong steps after a new law of the eucalyptus. Main Targets: that the end of discrimination and the greatest part of the euphoria and eroscalal euphoria may be extended, and that this magnificent opportunity, which has not yet reached the world of the euca, will open to him that wonderful opportunity of learning to euca, that opportunity which will be opened to him by beautiful new worlds. What would have been the instrument of this Euskalization, the important instrument, I\'m talking about the radio show on the eau-Eussalka, is standing there, and you\'ll understand, and I swear to you, understand me, what a pain this is to say to me. And in this case, too, the time has come for us to reach the subject seriously, and with what public communication we would have, to make a living, to make a living, to examine all the facts, all the alternative patterns, to put them on the table. It seems to me that the model has failed, especially once again, because it has been partly a model copied from the Spanish radio show by the Euscal radio show, except perhaps at the beginning. There are other models in the world, other ways to pay for media, and of course there are other ways of doing it. Euskara must be the first to serve the Basque People. The priority must be the quality of information. And we must learn here that information\'s quality is not measured in hand by the timer, so that we can see how many minutes each party has gone off screen. It seems to me that we have need to be deéverated in that, too. And so, considering all this, not just EITB, but also EIB, but because we must reflect deeply on EITB and all the communal space of EIB and euscal, and we must collect the Basque People. We want a healthy society, starting with young people. and although they are often connected with age, yet it is possible, as you know, to prevent many of these evils from children: fatity, diabetesari, charidious illnesses. Hence we wish to set up an integral plan in the health world, in order to take care of it by the health and educational department, in which the end will be to cut down the rate of fatity between ten years below 20 years. The healthy young men today will be healthy and healthy to-morrow. In this sense, one of our goals is to guarantee the subjective right of all the citizens for a healthy nourishment, and this is a direct relation to the feeling of nourishment; produced in it, consumed in it, proper food, more physical exercise, and more healthy people. And for this purpose, it is necessary that the primary health condition should be specially guarded, and that the pediatrical services should be strengthened. So every Pediatra shouldn\'t have more than 700 children in his cup. And generally the primary attention must be strengthened. It is always said that these are the doors of the health system, but in the past ten years it has not been augmented by personal attention and not by means of any kind. In a society which wants to be an axis of solidarity, the health system must be a direct indication of it, and therefore must guarantee universality and equality. And, of course, it is not possible to fall into the temptation of privatization. Health has been taken all over the world as business, and the interests and fortunes of pharmaceuticals and health companies are enormous, and we know that, but we must be very careful about it. Sublation, Orlection, are always concepts which must be carefully used, but still more in the health world, because the welfare and life of the people are in question. The list of preparations, the wallet service, will have to be repacked to see if the other person can get the rest of his palate in. And it is especially necessary to reform it, and from the opinions of the professionals, on the basis of scientific evidence, of course, if therapeutic measures which are offered must be maintained or modified in this respect. All the plans and measures mentioned during this discourse are possible. All measurements have been carefully examined, not only on political level, but on technical level, and everyone has proved economicability. But if there is money, it is not properly divided. As I said before, the priorities are not what our people need. But, in any case, it will be necessary to pay taxes. but not all of us, either by some or by others. Our prosecuting attorney is far from the average of Europe, far from the most advanced countries. That\'s why we propose agreements for progressive tax policy. Half the wealth which originates in Denmark is added by the State, more or less than three in ours. That doesn\'t mean we all have to pay any more, but we have to make deep changes and reforms, so that people who really have money will pay for it, because they don\'t pay much. There are those who are committed to making us believe that we are leaving the money for the fraud in social benefits. Besides not being true – and to the data I refer myself – what is behind is that runrun that has a clear intention. And the clear intention is not to focus on the right place. If the little one disappoints the fraud is small, but when the big one does, then the fraud is greater. We believe that the independent tax fraud observatory needs to be set up, to assess how much money we lose, what is done in other countries, and to fight against fraud, to propose measures. And we will have to monitor above all the type of corporate tax, especially those that pay – or those that do not pay – large companies as well. In addition, VAT and other taxes agreed. I really find it very difficult to understand how it would be possible for workers to charge nominators to acknowledge that their income is much larger than the most professional and professional companies. We\'ve been listening to that for years now, because the unions in this country have been accusing it and I think the administration is ignoring it. In this Arlo, as in all others, we must use our imaginations, because we must make a way full of obstacles and obstacles. And using the imagination, why not collect, for instance, the electric companies, who cut off light during the hard winter, those companies whose president wins forty thousand euros every day, because of the electromagnetic infection that their cables produce? To give you an example. This parliament, however, has but little jurisdiction in the prosecution. These jurisdictions are in the principal assemblies, and, I dare say, above all in the Courts of Spain, and shall be directed to the councils of the Supreme Council. But in this line, let us say that the Basque People want a strong people, a cohesion of people, thought of as a people, not as a product of land. Perhaps in this very law it is necessary to examine the law of the Himistric Lands, and to consider the course which may already be taken: We wish a people of thought as a people, which has been conceived as a State, which will not fall into provincialism, and which will very well account for the provinces. And even in financial matters there is very little jurisdiction, and also the great Madrid control. Europe says that the sum of deficit is necessary, but that\'s not true, in our case it\'s not true, we are told by Spain. And we don\'t even have the reputation policy from Frankf Year or Brussels, but Madrid. We don\'t have the effective tools or levers, and it\'s necessary for a people to move forward. In this case, then, it is necessary that we should make a treaty, what form and what business we should give to the Basque Financial Organization, because it is not reasonable that the Minister of the Ecofinen De Guindos should be in our name. We have an enormous challenge for the next four years, ladies and gentlemen, as far as life is concerned. History has shown us that here and in the world the ill-closed wounds are corrupted and reopened. It\'s been five years since he left all his weapons once, five years. Thousands of people who have voted these elections were only 13 years old and many things have changed in the Basque Country these five years. We have shown by our fellow escals, one of aces, and another, a great deal of light, that we are able to do a great deal of things together. Many things have changed, but none; The position of the Spanish government and, in some measure, of France has not changed. Just as they have not changed their efforts to obstruct the existence of a community of euscals. The Basque Country is not afraid of that debate. As soon as the Basque Country was born, it has been clear that only peaceful and democratic means of making politics are acceptable, and, although it has been accused of the contrary, you will find the Basque People in the United States, and the majority of the Basques know it well, and some of the politicians who succeeded in paying great compensations. In this, as in all others, we must proceed. And to advance, as has been said before, it is necessary to close the wounds as required, first and then to confess the regeneration due to all the victims, and give them as much attention as possible. A great road has been made in this sense, but not entirely, and therefore it will not be useless to have it always dealt with. But victims are to be respected above all things, respect of courtesy, respect of pain and suffering which they have suffered. And it is not necessary to separate what they have suffered, it is not the pain which they have been forced to separate. It\'s not the same thing to do a pint or a trifulka or kill a person. They can\'t match because it\'s not the same thing. And they are also owed an exquisite respect for all human rights, those of all people. And let me tell you that, in this sense, respect for freedom of expression is no less. In order to close his wounds, he\'ll have to act. He\'ll have to deal with a lot of things. And in the first place, we must begin with the defence of the soul, and we must facilitate this way with the greatest harmony. But I repeat, the Spanish Government is the only one who has not moved in this matter for five years. The Basque People are ready to collect in this parliament in this way of agreement, and it seems to us an important point for this purpose to be the plan of social forum. And to close the wounds, it will be voluntary demilitary of the Basque Country. The Spanish police, the Civil Guard, the Army, have to run a plan to return to Spain. This Parliament has said before. For one thing, to limit the laws already established, and to provide for them, because they do not need so many agents to guard ports and airports. But on the other hand, the situation has changed in this country. And if we close the wounds, the situation of the prisoners will be solved. And even in this matter, the only one who has not moved is the Spanish Government. Sick prisoners should be home at once today. And no one should travel thousands of miles when he visits a family. Dispertion is not in the Spanish Code, but it is the penalty inflicted by hundreds of citizens every week, and their only crime is to love them. Last accident last week. The Spanish Government has the key to prisons. He\'s the only one in the world who hasn\'t given an answer to the will to disarm an armed organization. Today at Colombia, again, they will sign the peace agreement a second time. It\'s stubborn, but we\'ll have to figure out how to get the key. It\'s not easy, but there\'s some paths going on, and we\'re going to take a new measure over those roads. In this sense, we propose that this parliamentism and Parliament of Navarre, and this Parliament and this government are willing to provide a full support for the international relations in order to make their work normal, without passing through the National Court of Spain, and in order to set up precise steps and form them into society: of the state of prisoners, of men in exile, of transitional justice, of the burning of victims, of demigration, of memory, of all the consequences which the violence of the last century has left in the Basque Country. We even propose to organize a committee of truth, to start taking steps, because there are many facts that have not been studied and solved. And when we ask for truth, justice, and attention to all victims, we ask for truth, justice, and attention. We know also that the present has taught us so, that not one peace shall satisfy all sides. We\'re going to have to establish a future life under the respect of various relattos. They are trying to impose on us the logic of victors and losers, but history teaches us that every day it is a very stubborn and a little disappointed, and the citizens of this old and learned country have spoken very clearly to us in the Socimeter of the week, and very clearly tell us what they want and what they don\'t want. And they don\'t want that logic. Basque citizenship, Euskal Herria, deserves to leave behind the 20th century and face the future with hope. For many things, but especially because we owe it to those who have suffered so much. The Basque Country must be equal to the rest of the free folk in the world. That\'s what men and women live here deserve, not less. The Basque Country must be independent and independent. That\'s the purpose of the Basque People gathering, and that\'s why she\'s going to go to work. Unfortunately, we are the only force that now wants to begin the road to the independent Basque People. And we\'re not enough yet, but we\'ll be. Throughout this speech I have heard a lot of references to reforms, to decision-making changes, to investments... In any normal country that would be a logical approach. Here, however, it is not. We\'re always looking back at Spain: ""They won\'t let us,"" ""they won\'t like it,"" ""they\'re going to resort to it,"" ""they\'re going to cancel it."" ""They\'ve already appealed to us,"" ""They\'ve already annulled us."" We think the time has come to say enough. We need to say that we don\'t want to live under anybody\'s yoke, we\'re mature. The majority of this Euscal parliament is that which admits that the Basque Country is a nation, and in so far as it is a nation, has a right to decide the future. The vast majority, derived from very different political traditions: Those who drink from the sources of liberalism, the Christian democracy, the social democracy, the marxistics, the left drugists, from many sources. A great majority acknowledges the nationality and the right of determining the American people. In this parliament there are at least 57 of the parliament, and moreover the first, second and third force of Parliament, which represent three-quarters of the voters. That is, three quarters of the electorate, 75% of those who voted in September, supported the right to decide. It is no longer worth talking about sufficient or insufficient majorities, lack of support... that another support, that another idea receives a higher level of support... I will try to make this very clear, so that everyone can understand me: 75% support, whether in this Parliament or in any other democratic system, is such a large majority that no one can question it. Everything else is excuses, and we will not accept that in the name of it is not well known which transversality, or much less in the name of which plurality, are extended veto rights in favour of anyone. There\'s no excuse. The right to decide is here and now the business to work. It has to be now. I have often said, and you have often heard me, ours is not eternity; this country has chosen us for four years, and not for six years or eight years. So it\'s necessary that in four years we can say to people, ""Yes, we did,"" or ""We\'re giving them a lot of steps."" In order to do so, my team will propose immediate action in the Parliament for two main documents at the end of two years: One, saying that as this parliament, this Araba, Biscaia, and Gipuia, is only a member of Euscal Autonomy, is ready to make a democratic choice, and that he will not refuse that right in the future. And a second one that will work out how to do it. I really don\'t like the terms of the debate very much, and I don\'t think them very clear, and if it were for us, the duty of this committee or sub-variety would be to write a constitution directly. Today, a government presided over by Euskal Herria Bildu is the guarantee of being able to move forward on this path from this very moment on. But I\'ve already said that as the Basque Country is the only one who\'s betting on independence, we know that we\'re going to have to get along with the rest of the teams. And we\'re ready on that road, as we said in the campaign, if the majority think that what we\'re supposed to agree on here is the affection of Madrid, that trip in Madrid to do it again. But we\'re not ready, and that\'s what we said in the campaign, when Madrid\'s refused, to keep his arms crossed. And therefore we think we ought to agree beforehand what we should do if this happens. We can\'t hold our arms crossed and we can\'t afford to put the decision in a drawer. And why do we ask Madrid to give us a no? For the monarchic restoration of the 75th century in Spain had a vice of origin: the new monarch was appointed by the dictator Franco, choosing also someone who did not touch him, jumping even the monarchic legitimacy itself, basically so that everything remained the same, tied and well bound. A constitution was then adopted to give any democratic appearance, but the vice of origin persisted and persisted. With more or less homologable forms, the central center of defense of unity, of maintenance of the great structures of power, remains unchanged in Spain. Spain has long been in trouble, and it has long been decided how to fix it, sometimes carrot and always stick. In Navarre, the Law of the Improvement, and Araba, Bizia, and Gipuzicus, the State of Guernica, are the last carrots, few, and few tastes, which are not yet filled. How many times has this parliament requested that the State of Guernica be filled? How many times has he asked for and how many more is he willing to ask? The State of Guernica has long been appointed for dead, because it does not answer the inspirations of this people, because it does not answer the necessities of this people. The Constitutional Court of Spain has made it perfectly clear: the excess is indivisible, and it is of the Spaniards. Respecting historical rights, but always respecting the Constitution. And if these rights were to be updated, the main axis of the Constitution of Spain ought to be respected. That is to say, the indivisible unity of Spain. That\'s all quite clear, you all know that. So we have to break that bell, and we must begin by taking steps to get rid of it. Therefore, we think that Madrid, who is ever going to give up his head, will again reject what he decides here, if he decides here at least that this nation is a nation and that he has a right to decide his future in freedom. And that\'s why it\'s not a chance to stand folded when you\'re refused. And since it\'s not an option, we\'d like to put two more measures in motion. And that\'s why we\'re proposing that, in connection with the Basque President, the organization called Decoral Self-organ, should be created and murdered by the head of a distinguished academic individual. And it would be his job to have all the legal and technical tools that the Basque People will need to be independent. And with that, to reinforce the network for the New Year\'s out-of-town relationships in the world, without forgetting that he\'s up to this time had the right to decide the Basque Country and Basque Country to the cannibals of the world and to get to the opinions of the public. Things take step by step, and so we propose to do. But life is not linear, nor is it linear. Our object is to be prepared four years from here, and at any moment, if possible, at any moment, to have all the tools prepared for the independence of the Basque Country. I said this is the right thing to do, but not just here. Because the work done here will require protection from many of the agents of this country: the unions, especially the other motives of society, but also the municipal and diputations. Above all, the citizen will need us to push him. The people of the village will have the protagonism in this process, we, the legislators, need the popular impulse, and it will be our duty to answer the demands of the people. That\'s why we\'re calling for protection from two documents of the self-interest. Let the people say that the Basque People agree to be a nation, and that they have a right to decide; and let them say with that idea they agree, and give us an exact order, that they may give us understanding to defend themselves in the presence of the world, as well as in Madrid. We see that this can be done in 2018 at the Basque Country in Union: It\'s a bonding consultation around the new political state in 2018. He\'s been modified in Europe. Scotland will make a second referendum on independence by the time it comes to bruxit, President Puigdemont in Katalunia has ordered it for the next year\'s September. They make us wonder and envy each other. We are admired by both Scotland and Catalonia, because their citizenship has been able to articulate in a mature way to give way to an absolutely democratic demand, and also because their institutions have been able to rise to the level of citizenship, assuming the leadership that corresponds to them. Each country writes its story, Euskal Herria will write its own, but not to anyone\'s dictate. The wave of freedom that Europe is going through must and will also come to our country. Euskal Administrazioak azkarra eta gardena izan behar du. An administration must serve the citizenry, not the other way around. An administration that takes advantage of the ignorance of the administrators, or that plays with extending deadlines or giving a no for a response, believing that the citizen will have neither profit nor money to go to court, is not the administration we want. Before I keep talking about Administration, I don\'t want to forget its most important ingredient: people. The public workers have been the ones who, in hard years for them too – because they lowered their pay from night to morning, they have taken off an extra pay that they are recovering to locks and ravines, although the salary drop remains the same –... so I want to mention these men and women who, with their daily work, have managed to keep this country to a large extent their progress. There was no such thing as the company\'s company. And it is necessary to accept a law of transparency. There\'s no real problem with all the records of the administration being public, protecting personal data properly, of course. Information, all the information the Administration has, is that of the citizen, and not of the current government. The law of transparency forces all administrations and councils. The people who are informed are more mature, and being informed, it is easier to decide. The law of transparency is a step in order to enable the people to do so, but they must be given the right to decide with it. Therefore we shall bring together with the law of transparency a law of inquiry to this parliament, which will regulate the manner of consulting the peoples, in the town-level, in the rank of the people, in the rank of the people, in the court of the people, in the Biscay, and in the Gipuzic, we have no right to do so at all in the Basque Country. And with the law of the consuls, this parliament will open the gates to the public officers, and they themselves may be able to control them. They\'re citizens of politics who put us here, and not just for the people, but for the people, we have to work with the people. I, who have just come into this world, you all know, and it seems as if the villagers have been discussing it more naturally than the members of this Parliament for years past, that they have obtained their consent much more in a much more natural manner, and that we play a part here. Let\'s not make theaters. I dare to suggest to you, to suggest to all of us, that in this too, let us dissipate the way we do politics in Euskal Herria. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I have come to ask for the confidence of this House because I firmly believe that our country needs to move forward. We\'ve had many years of paralysis, and we can\'t afford to go on like this for another four years. And I come to ask for the confidence of this House because I believe that this people must tell the whole world, loud and clear, that there is a country here that wants to be free, because it wants to live better. Euskal Herria Bildu is the only guarantee that this can be done, and of course I assure you that we will work tirelessly, and that we will continue to work tirelessly. Mrs. President, members of Parliament, all of you invited to-day, the Basque Country must advance, win the future, we can\'t lose four more years, because we\'ve been back and forth for many years. And we have to tell the world that the Basque People want to be free, that we want to be masters of ourselves, and that the Basque People are the only guarantee of it. And I give you my word that we will act with courage and strength until we have attained these ends, because we want to live better because we don\'t want to live under any one\'s yoke. ""We are here saying that another world is possible, even to those who have tried to stop us. We are all the world, and that is why we hold out a hand, smiling, laughing at the four winds, to the four winds."" These are the words of the verse Jon Maia, and they sum up well what I have meant to you in a great degree. We open our hands to the four political forces which are here, as we said at first, as we told you, and as we told you at first, and as we shall hereafter repeat to you, our hands are truly open. I want to say the same thing to all the social and unional agents in the Basque Country, to the women, to the men, to every citizen, to the four winds, the hands of the Basque Country are open. We\'re offering another culture to make a better and more advanced town. It\'s beautiful and it\'s not a dream, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all very much. [[Applause]]', 'Thank you, Mr. Vice President. The esteemed attorneys and the committee on gender equality who may not have read this report could see that it contained the lawyer’s treatment of complaints against citizens and citizens based on gender, marital, family status, sexual orientations in particular in the field of work and employment, domestic violence, education, political participation and media. On the basis of those complaints, the Ombudsman also makes certain recommendations in the report. We could see that from year to year the largest number of remarks are actually going in that part of the employment and of course domestic violence, and that is the biggest problem as well as the work of the attorney but also the general gender equality. In view of the handling of the complaints carried out by the Ombudsman and the analysis, in the 2015 report in question, the Ombudsman set out 82 case descriptions and gave a total of 93 recommendations. As in previous years, as I have said, the most complaints are just coming from women, so more than 90% of these complaints, the basis of sexual discrimination, related to labour market discrimination, social security, then domestic violence and the area of justice. Most often women complained about sexual harassment at work, a contract for a certain period of time, which is also a long-standing problem, and most of the employees for a certain time are women, discrimination based on motherhood. Defeating data that women during pregnancy or after returning from maternity leave to work were almost 80 to 85% of the cases were thrown out of some form of discrimination, whether it was that they were assigned to a lower job, of course this job was also less paid, that they could not use an annual vacation, free days or sick leave. Then family status and unequal wages. The Ombudsman also states that the above is surprising in view of the long-standing trends related to the unemployment rate, and just when a major unemployment problem arises, especially when only the last two to three years the expansion of the number of unemployed in Croatia has just been the women\'s biggest labour market victims, then the birth-related segregation on the market, the increase in the number of employees based on the employment contract on a certain and increasing difficulty in the availability of work contracts on unspecified women. And it is certain that every woman who has accepted work is not because she wanted it but because she wanted to feed her family, her children, and that she would have the conditions and resources for her family’s basic existential needs. And for the last three years, as I mentioned, we have met with a high rate of unemployment growth. The complaints are primarily focused on the treatment of state bodies and other legal entities, not on individuals. In the field of labour and employment, women face discrimination on the labour market, there is a pay gap of almost 10%, and regardless of the level of education of women, they lose jobs more often than men. And we know that as a percentage of the highly educated inhabitants of the Republic of Croatia, women make up the majority. It also warns of the pay gap present, a man in Croatia annually earns about 10,400 kuna grossly more than a woman. The Croatian labour market remains sexually segregated, with a total of 19 areas of activity for women being highly or significantly sub-represented in 8, mostly in construction, mining, water supply, waste management, etc. Financial activities and activities of insurance, health and social services and education areas where they are more represented but here it should be pointed out that the higher the level of decision-making, for example in the judiciary, the smaller the representation of women is. So the fact is that women are employed in those activities and in those responsibilities, leading and executives with less wages. And that\'s where the pay gap actually comes from. And they\'re more educated than men. It is also important to mention the major problem of economic violence against women, especially unemployed women who are also victims of domestic violence, and the unemployed are often left in a family with a bully because they have no other income to feed themselves and their children. And for this reason, I point out that it is very important to ratify the Istanbul Convention on the Prevention of Violence against Women signed by the Republic of Croatia in January 2013 and thus assume the obligation of comprehensive protection of women against all forms of violence. The report also states that measures are still under-implemented in Croatia that allow the harmonisation of family and professional obligations. Last year, there was a slight increase in the number of fathers who used maternity and parental leave and according to the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance maternity and parental leave, only 2% of men were used while maternity and parental benefits were used by only 1.7% of fathers. And that\'s all because a male family member\'s father is better paid than a woman. And if we know that from the 6th month to the 12th month of a child\'s life, then we don\'t have a partial part of the birth benefit because of it and women more often almost 98% of the cases stay with the child at home. It is also noted that the experiences of other countries have shown that fathers use their right to parental leave when they are well paid even though certain quotas have been established. Sexual stereotypes in the field of parental care continue to be the most common reason for complaining about fathers while mothers point to the insensibility of professionals associated with the domestic violence they have been exposed to. It should also highlight the encouraging environment and good co-operation with the police, as we heard in the report of the Committee on Gender Equality and the exceptional co-operation of the social care centre that is very important. Domestic violence and violence against women and children remains a major problem as well as the fact that in cases of domestic violence, police regularly bring and retain the investigation of both spouses. In connection with sexual harassment, there is also a certain concern for victims of sexual harassment who give up reporting for fear of revenge. We heard the esteemed Ms. D.A. pointed out that the City of Zagreb has a very good system of resolving the problem of domestic violence and I personally can confirm it, but I think it is very important that every city and every county in the Republic react in the right way and that every woman, child, member of the family who is the victim of domestic violence is protected and allowed to be independent and among other things to leave the violent family. With regard to cases of domestic partner violence, women remain mostly victims of domestic violence, a number of complaints remain about non-recognition of certain forms of domestic violence. As we note the continuing decline in domestic violence, compared with the previous year, more than 100% of women victims in the criminal acts of domestic violence have been reported. The Ombudsman also conducted an interesting survey on women and men\'s representation and on gender equality in central information emissions broadcast on both HRT and commercial TVs to Novitv and RTL. The survey has shown that women are significantly sub-represented both as interlocutors and as exclusive guests on all three televisions but are mostly as journalists those who appear from the field. The representation of gender equality issues is almost negligible. So it\'s not even 1% in total of all three televisions. The Ombudsman states that sexual stereotypes and sexism remain in the media and that the media persistently use the female body as an object to attract attention to other content or to evaluate women solely by the basis of their appearance. And here, of course, we come to the question of the political representation of women both here in the Croatian Parliament and in the units of local self-government. Women are in charge of corporate economic duties, but also in political life they are well under-represented. So only 15% is elected representative to the Croatian Parliament. Surely the reason for this is also the delay in the application of the law to which all lists should be represented by 40% of the sub-represented sex. It\'s now unfortunately still a woman. But we can also read here in general relations and media, as well as all participants in public and political life, as well as in the part of the reaction that the Association is dealing with women\'s protection, so in some part and the Ombudsman for gender equality, often during, before and after pre-election campaigns, does not react to obvious discrimination based on sex. We also had this example in the presidential campaign. We had a woman who was a candidate, who was elected by the voter\'s will and as president of the Republic of Croatia, with a statement not later than the campaign by the lawyer for gender equality, there were no other reactions, especially during June and July when the election campaign was far from responding to gender discrimination. This time, the president of the Republic of Croatia comes from the ranks of HDZ, the Patriot coalition. At times, some candidates for mayors, mayors, will come from some other political parties for the most political duties. I don\'t think we should be politically divided in that part. The reaction must focus exclusively on gender discrimination, not on which political parties, from a political spectrum, a certain candidate comes. While on the other hand we have reactions, for example, there was a reaction which I also welcome, and I think it is good to react when the Free Dalmatia article is only signed with the initials ""Beautiful Women Pass Through Pity"". In the text of the article on the horrors of refugee fates which we have witnessed and actively Croatia has joined. The author considers it appropriate to write about the physical beauty of refugee women who have blinded their beauty despite the conditions they were forced to face. These are also topics that need to be responded to. And what is very important and I think that in the coming period should be more focused and gender defenders, but also Croatian Government, Croatian Parliament and all ministries is demographic policy, demographic renewal. Because in this report she is almost slightly represented on something smaller than one page. What is said, which is the fact that the figures show that the demographic image in the last year was extremely bad. Those who follow the area know that from the moment when the number of births and deaths was measured that just last year, Croatia experienced a demographic bottom, that a minimum number of children was born in the history of statistical measurement. Regarding women\'s unfavourable position in the Croatian labour market, the high unemployment of women, the failure to help and to react how certain institutions especially in the part of the Government of the Republic of Croatia, according to the competent ministries, if we know that in the last four years, the biggest problem with emigration was precisely a demographic decline, I think it was very necessary to react to that part because it was the responsibility of all of us, all of us, in public, social, political life and, of course, parallel work on the development of economic and demographic policy. I certainly want to point out here that by acting by reacting to demographic decline, but also by pointing to the help of women, working women to have adequate help both in local self-government units, cities and counties, that they know how and how their children will if their mothers have a place in kindergarten The school and the living room. [[Intruder Tepesh: Time.]] And this is an important factor in the part to work on equalities between women in the labour market and the demographic restoration of Croatia. Thank you very much.']","<|system|>

I have made a pledge on behalf of the National Party of Action on the first chapter of the 314th Amendment. Nuclear energy was on the agenda of politicians, scientists and industrialists, which began in 1879 with the discovery of uranium and continued in 1934 with the disintegration of the atom. As with many other technological developments, studies that began in the field of military defence later continued commercially. Many countries, including the United States and Russia, have done intensive work on the use of nuclear energy, and have developed systems that will convert the heat energy that is revealed as a result of the break-up of atoms into electrical energy. The expansion of nuclear plants began in the early 1970s with the oil crisis. Without oil and other hydrocarbon sources, countries have turned to the nuclear power plant to ensure their dependence on these resources and their energy supply security. While nuclear power plants were quickly being put into business around the world, it continued to be built around the world in 1979, even though there was a relatively slowdown in the Three Mile Island and Soviet Russia in 1986. After Turkey's approval of the Paris Climate Agreement and in 2053 it should be seen as an essential element of nuclear energy in line with the goal of having a carbon neutral economy and energy system. Therefore, nuclear must be included in Turkey's energy mixture. All low-carbon energy technologies, including nuclear energy, are needed to reach the goal of limiting the Paris Agreement's global temperature increase to less than two degrees. According to a report by the European Economic Council of the United Nations, nuclear energy will be a source of energy that will help meet the Paris Agreement and its 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. As of July 2018, 453 nuclear reactors operate in 31 countries and 57 nuclear reactors are being built in 17 countries. Electricity produced in nuclear power plants corresponds to 11 per cent of the world's electricity supply. According to the country, about 72 per cent of the French electricity demand, 55 per cent of Ukraine, Belgium, Sweden 40 per cent, South Korea 27 per cent, the European Union 30 per cent, and the United States 20 per cent are covered by nuclear energy. 15 of the nuclear reactors under construction are in China, 7 are in India, 6 are in Russia. However, in the United States, 2, 4 in the United Arab Emirates, 4 in South Korea, 4 in France and Turkey are building nuclear reactors. Our country's aim to build a half-century nuclear power plant began with the signing of the Agreement on 12 May 2010 of a nuclear power plant in Akkuyu Field in the Republic of Turkey between the Republic of Turkey and the Russian Federation government. In addition to Akkuyu, work continues for two new nuclear plants in the region of Sinop and Thrace. To ensure economic stability and continuity, you must ensure the continuity of the energy supply. Despite the limited resources of the world, the energy demand is very high and is increasing day by day. In today's conditions, most of the energy needs are still derived from fossil fuels. It is estimated that fossil fuel resources will be exhausted within 50 years as a result of a simple projection of energy demand maintaining the current rate of increase. For Turkey, which has to import most of its energy needs, it must add nuclear plants to its energy supply portfolio to keep its development move at a sustainable level and to increase its industry to levels of international competition. With an increasing demand for energy due to economic development, requests for new and renewable energy from alternative energy sources and nuclear energy are seen to rise, depending on research that coal from fossil fuels will be exhausted in two hundred and fifty years, 50 years. Turkey's use of nuclear energy as an alternative energy form in energy dependence and energy supply security is increasing day by day. Although nuclear power plants have high cost, low fuel and operating costs are an important advantage. Nuclear energy as an alternative to natural gas, which is dependent on the world. The negative effects of nuclear plants, such as soil pollution and radiation, can be said to be relatively less than fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and natural gas, and more than renewable energy sources. Although localisation policies in the field have been increasing recently, they have not yet reached enough levels. Nuclear energy in energy production is an option that needs to be evaluated in countries such as Turkey, which are in an out-dependent position on oil and natural gas, which have recently begun to accelerate work on underground resources. The money Turkey spends on energy imports is increasingly challenging the state's industry in the international arena. The emphasis on the need for nuclear energy production is not only for the satisfaction of consumption, but also for Turkey's strategic plans to become a great state, as well as for its advantage. Energy production through nuclear power plants provides continuity in energy supply, while the production stage contains a series of non-failable processes. The scenarios that could have been caused by an accident must be carefully evaluated, and the public health decision-making authorities must always make the necessary moves in the first place. The global energy system faces two important challenges today. The first is more energy production, and the second is less carbon emissions. More explicitly, studies continue to use production technologies that are least harmful to the environment as cheap and sustainable energy supplies are intended. In this context, the use of nuclear energy provides significant advantages, even if it contains some risks. Some of these advantages can be listed as continuous and uninterrupted production of electricity using nuclear power, producing electricity in nuclear plants at more affordable costs than other plants, lack of greenhouse gas emissions, and the production of energy of nuclear technology, as well as the use of physics, medicine, transport, agriculture in many areas. Nuclear energy has a number of negativeities as well as the advantages mentioned here. The most important topic in this area is nuclear waste and their storage processes. While nuclear energy is being obtained, there is a large amount of radioactive waste, and the preservation of these wastes brings with it a serious risk element. Although Turkey has only just met nuclear energy, Turkey is in an advantageous position to use modern, technological equipment. Turkey, which continues its activities to keep the risks of security to a minimum, says it will continue its work in the field of nuclear power to enrich its energy portfolio and increase its energy supply security, and I salute the General Assembly with that feeling and thoughts."", ""Madam President. Ladies and gentlemen! Appreciate Mrs. Minister – in your case, too, really valued! Unfortunately, we need to note that nuclear power is currently being revived globally. The debate on the use of nuclear energy has finally begun significantly. The majority of the EU Commission's neoliberal ideas want to define nuclear energy as sustainable this month, so to speak, Greenwashing by lobbying. As it seems, neither Chernobyl nor Fukushima were able to convince the Commission. There is simply no understanding that nuclear power plants represent a great potential for danger. We need a lot of alliance partners to stop the nuclear lobby together with 20 countries. Prominent arguments of the advocates are as follows: Nuclear power plants supply CO2-free energy. However, they save in their arguments that there is no functioning final storage for jetty nuclear waste, they save on uranium mining, which causes major environmental damage, that the extraction of uranium promotes human rights violations, and that the risk of supergaus is quite real. These risks have never been offset. What are we doing in the event of a reactor accident? Do we then strip off entire areas and settle half of Europe? A lockdown will not be enough in the event of a nuclear accident. It definitely comes to a Knockdown. Of course, this trend towards nuclear power is sobering and worrying for the Austrian population, which has decided against nuclear milestones and the production of nuclear power, especially if, as this panel clearly shows, we are radiating properly in our neighborhood. [[Keeping a table with the title ‘Atom power plants around Austria’, on which a map of Austria and the locations of the neighbouring nuclear power plants are shown]] We are surrounded by 13 nuclear power plants, and today we are talking about this power plant in Paks in Hungary – in the earthquake area. This all-party request speaks It is against the further expansion of the Paks II nuclear power plant, which is only 180 kilometres away. It is still important to stress that we in Europe should be a non-atomic model and must be completely clean. That means we have to be honest, where we still import more than 10 percent of nuclear power per year into Austria to cover our energy consumption. The end-user does not know exactly whether or not he receives nuclear power, whether there is nuclear power in it or not. Nuclear power cannot be the game changer in climate change, nuclear power cannot be the solution for the future! A red and white-red power act for a European alliance of reason is more than ever announced. Thank you."", ""Thank you for the floor, Mr President. Dear Parliament, Dear Citizens, Before changing the decision on the management of nuclear waste, I would like to briefly describe the position of the Dialogue on nuclear energy in general. There are some misconceptions, even false news generated knowingly, about the government's fundamental assessment of nuclear power. First of all, I would like to eliminate these. The first is such an important false statement that nuclear power would be cheap. On the contrary, nuclear power production is currently the most expensive. The cheapest is electricity produced in solar and wind power plants. Nuclear power is cheap once the power plant has been built as in Paks I, and the investment costs are not counted, but when they talk about Paks II and they talk about the expansion of the nuclear power plant, it is clear that it is the most expensive form of energy production, including the cost of installation. So let's forget about that, and let's really give this question an act from an economic point of view. The second important claim is that nuclear energy would be climate neutral so as not to emit carbon dioxide. On the contrary, if we look again at its entire life span, the whole cycle, the life cycle of the construction, operation and demolition of a nuclear power plant, then it will certainly emit more carbon dioxide per megawatt produced than a gas plant. So even gas plants are more environmentally friendly, climate-friendly than the construction of nuclear power plants, so from this point of view, I ask that we forget this story, and if we really want a climate-neutral Hungary, let us note that this is not the way to build new nuclear power plants. For the third time, it is not true that nuclear energy is safe. Nuclear power is extremely dangerous. Think of Mayak, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl or Fukushima. There were major disasters due to the peaceful use of nuclear power, and we did not even talk about war use at the time. So nuclear energy is the most dangerous source of energy that can only be imagined, and it is particularly serious when it comes to the fact that it remains waste, radioactive material that this resolution is about, which will never cease to be harmful to health. In Hungary, the social discussion is about where to set up a permanent nuclear cemetery for high-activity, therefore the most dangerous radioactive waste in Hungary for all eternity. I'll tell you where: nowhere. It is a complete nonsense that, in a hundred thousand years' time, they will continue to produce radioactive waste next to a large city in a densely populated country, 10 kilometers away from Pécs, but anywhere in the country. It is not by accident that the special connection between Hungary and Russia in the use of nuclear power over the past decades is partly based on the use of Russian technology and the purchase of Russian fuel, but also on the receipt and handling of radioactive waste by the Russians. This cooperation should be extended to include the permanent treatment and disposal of these very dangerous radioactive waste in the territory of Russia, where millions of square kilometres are uninhabited, sites that are in no way harmful to human life and health have been given to place these waste. Set up nuclear sites there that stand the test of the hundred thousand years ahead, and not the final nuclear cemetery in Hungary. All in all, we must say that the use of nuclear energy is not desirable for Hungary at all, not a good alternative, not an attractive option at all. We do not say in the Dialogue, and we, the Greens, are not saying that Paks I. should be stopped immediately, obviously there would be an insurmountable impact on energy, economically and socially, but we say that when the working time for the Paks I reactors expires, we should stop using nuclear power and its production in Hungary. We've got nearly 20 years. A full energy revolution can be completed in nearly 20 years. If the government is really so committed, if it's really telling us to be climate neutral by 2050, then let's see how we can get there. The politician of the Dialogue, Benedek Jávor, has recently prepared the energy travel plan for Green Hungary, which, supported by step by step, numbers, data and expert analysis, shows how Hungary can have a climate-neutral energy policy by 2050 so that energy consumption can be reduced in such a way that, unfortunately, there is little mention in government circles when it comes to energy policy, so that there is simply no need for electricity produced in the nuclear power plant. We can do this, with lower consumption and the use of renewable energies, we can create a completely climate-friendly energy policy and an energy mix in Hungary. In addition, it is more economically advantageous and its safety risks are equal to zero; unlike this extremely dangerous nuclear story and the nuclear waste we are talking about now. Then I would like to turn to this proposal for a decision. We know that the amendment to the nuclear waste management decision is justified by the mandatory review of the national strategy every five years and by the harmonisation of EU legislation. However, there is no reason why the majority of governments have to produce a decision text of lower quality, which is becoming less and less secure at all times. That's what's happened now, most of all, what's left out of the version that's now in force. For example, the new version does not include the passage whereby, I quote:, in order to ensure safety, the possibilities and limitations of human performance must be taken into account throughout the lifetime of nuclear installations. You are obviously aware that ignoring the human factor has led to the most serious nuclear accidents in the world, and also in Hungary, Pakson, in 2003. The human factor cannot be ignored, and I do not understand why it is good to remove the reference to human error from the text. Such a failure in handling a nuclear power plant or nuclear waste can be fatal. [[14.20]] It is also out of the text that I quote the decisions on the national programme for the management of radioactive waste: the decision-making should be made with an open mind. With this, let us say, the majority of governments are really simply adapting the strategy or the decision to the Fidesz government's practice, but I do not think that the suba decision on nuclear energy use and nuclear waste on such issues would generally serve the safety of the Hungarian population. The extent to which it is not, you are an example of it in the proposal for a resolution when you are smuggling into the text the area already chosen by the government for the final disposal of high-activity radioactive waste, without consulting the population of Pécs, 10 kilometres from the border of the surrounding settlements, such as the research zone. Therefore, this proposal for a resolution cannot be voted in favour, we will not vote in favour, and we are also asking you to consider your position, to withdraw the proposal, to rewrite it, and to present at least a proposal to Parliament that increases and does not reduce the safety of nuclear energy use. As you say these days, I can only tell you: if you can't help me, at least don't hurt me. Thank you very much.""]","<|system|>

We share a common goal of wanting all new homes to be very energy efficient. I wrote to the House last week setting out the Government’s intentions on this matter Over the previous Parliament, we significantly strengthened the energy performance standards for new homes—a 30% improvement on the requirements before 2010. I thank the noble Lords, Lord Stunell OBE and Lord Foster of Bath, for their excellent work as Building Regulations Ministers in the coalition Government in delivering significant improvements in standards for new homes. New homes built to this standard are very energy efficient. They have A-rated condensing boilers, double-glazed windows with low-energy glass, and high levels of insulation and airtightness in their construction. These standards are reducing energy bills by an average of £200 annually for a new home and saving carbon, compared to standards before 2010 The most recent changes to the standards came only in April 2014, and we think it is right to give the housebuilding industry breathing space to build these highly energy-efficient homes before making further changes. There are also concerns that making homes even more energy efficient and airtight could contribute to the risk of overheating in new homes. The Committee on Climate Change, which the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, referred to, raised this in a report published in June last year. This is another reason to let the recent changes bed in and to allow time for a better understanding of the overheating issues raised in the report It is also recognised that the latest standards have pushed the fabric energy performance of homes to the point where further increases may result only in marginal energy efficiency returns. To meet the higher standards, housebuilders would need to consider further costly technical solutions for providing heat and power to the home—for example, photovoltaic panels, solar hot water systems, and air or ground source heat pumps However, we are not ruling out further improvements to standards. We know that they need to be kept under regular review, and we are committed to doing this and to introducing any cost-effective improvements to the standards. This review will include meeting our obligation in the energy performance of buildings directive to undertake a cost-optimal assessment of our energy efficiency standards. It will involve seeking evidence on the costs of energy efficiency measures and the benefits in terms of fuel bill savings and carbon savings. Current standards will be assessed against these to see whether they are cost optimal. If there is room to go further, the directive requires member states to take action to strengthen these standards As part of the process, we will seek the expert views of the Building Regulations Advisory Committee. We would also welcome evidence from the industry and others. In particular, we would like to receive evidence from the Committee on Climate Change, as well as from noble Lords in this House. We expect work to conclude in the autumn, to give time to reflect on the conclusions, to report to the Commission next year and to consider what needs to be done in any future Building Regulations. We would be happy to keep noble Lords apprised of the progress with the review and its conclusions The directive also requires us to introduce nearly zero energy building standards for new public buildings from the end of 2018 and for all new buildings from the end of 2020. We have already transposed the aims and timings of this requirement into the Building Regulations. I hope this reassures your Lordships that we are committed to a review and to introduce nearly zero energy building standards by the end of this Parliament, and therefore that the proposed clause is not needed In addition, the proposal does not cover a significant proportion of new homes—flats in high-rise blocks, of which we see so many in London. The carbon compliance level for flats in the proposed clause is based on work undertaken by Zero Carbon Hub for flats in blocks of up to four storeys only. The hub recognised that more work would be needed to develop levels appropriate for high-rise blocks. For instance, the use of photovoltaic panels, which the hub considers the most cost-effective means of meeting the levels proposed in the new clause, is more limited on high-rise blocks because there is proportionately less roof space available per apartment in the block. Any changes to the Building Regulations flowing from the upcoming review will require a full consultation, which will include draft technical guidance on how to meet the changes—guidance that will cover all homes, from detached houses to high-rise flats As well as being unsuitable for high-rise flats, it is not prudent to set requirements such as this in primary legislation. If in the light of consultation there needed to be any slight adjustments to requirements, we would not be able to do that without further primary legislation. We also do not need new powers to set energy performance standards in the Building Regulations, as the Building Act 1984 already allows us to do this. We must also remember that the Building Regulations set minimum standards for all homes—big and small—and cover all of England, including areas where homes are much needed but where there might be viability issues The Federation of Master Builders has pointed out that increased construction costs to meet higher standards have a greater impact on smaller builders. Higher regulatory standards may also make housing development unviable in some areas. The federation, which represents more than 13,000 small and medium-sized builders, was supportive of last July’s productivity plan announcement on zero-carbon homes, saying at the time: “Small local builders typically build more bespoke homes, with a strong focus on quality and high standards of energy efficiency. Yet over recent years it has been these smaller firms which have been hit disproportionately hard by the rapid pace of change. This burdensome regulation came at a time when SME house builders were beginning to recover and build more new homes which is crucial if we want to keep pace with the demand for new housing. The Government is therefore right to remove the unnecessary zero carbon standards which threatened to perpetuate the housing crisis … There has been an increasing feeling that the standards were in danger of running ahead of the industry’s understanding and ability to deliver” We therefore need to consider whether it is realistic for the majority of builders to deliver even higher standards without unduly affecting site viability or housing delivery The noble Lord, Lord Stunell, asked about costs and prices in Hertfordshire. I cannot provide those figures at this point, but I have some more general information, which is that construction costs nationally for new homes have increased by just over 2% a year over the past five years. Land prices have risen by about 7%, including inflation. Those increases in land prices and construction costs, which fall on housebuilders, have not been converted by increased house prices, which have risen by only 4%, so there is a potential viability gap. Where land prices have not risen or land values are very low to begin with, landowners are less likely to be willing to release land if housebuilders have to reduce the price that they can pay for land in order to offset costs Volatility is another factor. There is significant regional variation in land costs for residential development, and prices can be volatile at local level, as we know. That volatility can increase the risk to housebuilders Therefore, although I appreciate the intention behind the new clause, I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that it is unnecessary, given that the Government are absolutely committed to completing a review of standards. I therefore ask the noble Baroness to withdraw the amendment.', 'My Lords, the Government’s attempt to solve the current housing crisis needs, at the same time, to address the issue of what types of homes are built. They should be of high quality and high energy efficiency standards which drive down future energy bills, help to protect against fuel poverty and provide healthy living environments. The Explanatory Notes to the Bill make it clear that its principal aim is to bring forward proposals that make homes more affordable. This laudable aim was dealt a serious blow by the scrapping of the zero-carbon homes policy by the Chancellor last July. Without this standard, which until last July had cross-party and cross-industry support, the new homes promised by the Government will not be as affordable as they might be. They will lock their owners into a cycle of higher fuel bills and the need for costly retrofits. The amendment requires that all new homes built in England from 1 January 2018 achieve the previously agreed zero-carbon homes standard Reinstating this housing standard will not only help keep homes affordable for the long term, it will help meet our legally binding climate commitments. We are committed to reducing UK emissions by 50% by 2025. Buildings accounted for 34% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2014, with 64% of building emissions coming from homes. It is in the building sector that most of the cost-effective potential carbon savings are to be found. Housebuilding must, of course, remain financially viable for the private sector, which will deliver the bulk of future housing. Yet the scrapping of zero-carbon homes by the Chancellor was not accompanied by any evidence that building homes to that standard would affect the speed at which the UK can build new homes. Indeed, evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on National Policy for the Built Environment showed that the removal of the zero-carbon homes requirement has generated uncertainty for homebuilders. Moreover, they were provided with no clear evidence that the removal would lead to an increase in housebuilding. This evidence persuaded the committee—and I declare an interest as a member—to call on the Government to reverse the decision to remove the requirement for new homes to generate no net carbon emissions Reinstating the zero-carbon standard would help deliver affordable homes for the long term, and not burden occupants with needlessly high energy bills. This would also make the UK’s statutory greenhouse gas emission targets more achievable. Post-Paris, it is surely time for leadership and not backsliding. I beg to move.', 'My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Best for securing this important debate and for his excellent introduction. I want to talk not about the number of homes that we need but rather the quality of homes that we need, and to focus on whether we are building homes that are fit for the future—homes that, as we have heard, our people deserve. I declare my interests as vice-chair of the Committee on Climate Change and chair of the adaptation sub-committee I warmly welcome our Prime Minister’s focus on housebuilding and her strong message about the importance of homes in the renaming of the DCLG as the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. But carbon dioxide emissions from buildings make up a major and intractable part of our carbon budgets, so it would seem madness to build these essential new homes to building standards that mean they will need retrofitting in the near future if we are to meet our carbon dioxide reduction targets. In addition, we know that the climate is changing. We must expect, on average, higher summer peak temperatures and longer periods of high temperatures, leading to a growth in the number of heat-related deaths, especially among the most vulnerable groups, unless we have homes that can be kept cool and properly ventilated The studies reviewed by the Committee on Climate Change indicate that the average cost of delivering the proposed—and now withdrawn—zero-carbon homes standard would be an average of between £3,000 and £10,000 per house if it were to be done when the house is being built, and £10,000 to £25,000 as a later retrofit. Indeed, such retrofits would probably never achieve the same low level of emissions. Do we really intend to leave these retrofit costs—approximately three times the cost of building the house well in the first place—to our children? Is this another example of intergenerational unfairness Would the extra cost and challenge of higher building standards really be too much for our housebuilders? I do not think so. Let us look at some numbers, which we have heard a bit about already. In 2016-17, the top 10 housebuilders built almost 80,000 new homes, about 45% of the total new houses. They made profits of £4.53 billion on a turnover of £22 billion and paid their chief executives an average total pay of £3.1 million. That excludes the more than £100 million share bonus for the CEO of Persimmon, because it rather distorts the figures. If we take the average figure of £6,500 per house as the cost of meeting a zero-carbon homes standard—the halfway point between £3,000 and £10,000—building all these homes to this standard would cost an extra £0.51 billion, which is only 11% of the £4.53 billion profit. If housebuilders had absorbed all these costs, profits would still have come in at a very healthy £4 billion. As we have heard, Persimmon is the second-largest housebuilder in the top-10 list. Yesterday, the Times reported that it built 16,000 homes in the last year and allocated bonuses to its 140 top managers totalling £800 million. The extra cost of building all these homes to a zero-carbon standard would have been about £100 million. Would not a reduction in that impressive bonus pot to just £700 million still have allowed a motivating enough reward for a very good year for the company I have three requests of the Minister to help us move swiftly to future-proof our new housing stock. First, we should introduce as a matter of urgency a strong zero-carbon homes standard, and then ensure that the standard is actively enforced. The figures show that the industry can afford to do this. Secondly, within two years we should make Help to Buy available only on accredited low-carbon homes, thus making sure that the Government’s significant investment is safe in homes that will retain and increase their value in the future without the need for certain upgrading. Finally, we should allow housing associations that build low-carbon homes to finance the additional cost by taking a share of the savings that tenants will see in their heating bills—perhaps half the savings for seven years or whatever is necessary. I understand that this would currently be illegal, as housing associations cannot charge differential rents in this way.']","<|system|>

I too would like to thank the authors of this initiative for allowing us to discuss such a valuable issue as the forestry industry. I have to say at the very outset that I could not have imagined exactly ten years ago that when I turn 40 today, I will be able to talk to the Parliament House about such a fine thing as forests. This is a great thing. Thank you all for that. Mr President! Finland lives in the forest. Forests cover 73 per cent of Finland's land area. In Finland, about 70 per cent of the annual growth of trees is used. Forests have been protected to safeguard biodiversity by approximately 13% of our surface area. Finland’s forests absorb more than 40 per cent of Finland’s national greenhouse gas emissions. In the light of these figures, we in Finland are better off than in the rest of Europe. Forests have always been important to us and will continue to be so. Open fellings are made in our country in less than one per cent of the forest area each year. About 8 per cent of the volume of wood needed by industry has been harvested by central government countries. A ban on open cutting would reduce the supply of wood by Metsähallitus, a major supplier of wood raw material, especially in Northern Finland. An open felling suitable for certain places mimics a forest fire-like situation where there is plenty of light. Many species of life benefit from this. Fixed-life forestry has proved to be a sustainable method in Finland. Forests are becoming denser and the number and share of hardwood has increased even though fellings have at least remained unchanged or even increased. Mr President! Wood harvesting in Finland will become more challenging in the future. Climate conditions, diseases, parasites, new forest pests spreading to us and increasing storm damage are today. In such cases, open cutting can be a good thing. However, open fellings in swamped forests should be avoided. In any case, they do not provide productive economic forests due to harsh conditions. In Finland there are no longer any good frostings in the logging areas, when the land will remain thawed almost throughout the winter. The trees of the forest can fall at once when there is no more protective ice and snow cover. The share of risks will increase in the future. Mr President! Open fellings should not be stopped on state soils, but it should be noted that some of the forests of the state are of considerable age, especially in Lapland, where forest life dependes on them, such as the regressive spruce, the forest and the Lappish. It is good to keep such areas protected. The popularity of nature tourism is growing, and people want to see and experience the unspoiled nature of the forest. Different methods of forest management affect different types of forest species and structural features important for biodiversity. Mr President! The site of the forest and the existing trees place their own limitations on the rational management of the forest. Different forestry methods can be used in different forest stands in the same forest farm. What do you want me to do about it? Wood harvesting shall be carried out in a selective manner. The key question is where, how and to what extent open fellings are carried out. The ideal situation is that we have enough forest of different ages in Finland, at the same time both protected forests and economic forests, whose diversity is safeguarded by legislation, following the recommendations of good forest management and the criteria for forest certification. Finland has wood, which is a hack, and the forest industry needs raw material for its production every day. Forest regeneration with plantings is a good model in Finland. After the regeneration felling, the forest is either renovated mainly by planting or sowing. Processed seedlings are faster and more durable than wild trout. The strength of continuous forest farming is the avoidance of high costs and the preservation of forest cover. Water effects, such as the release of humus and the spill into lakes, will be reduced. Coal is also released from peatlands less without soil modification. Finally, I would like to say that I do not see any reason for cutting open on state land. - Thank you."", ""Mr President! Forests are very important to us from the point of view of people and other species. Forests are not just woodlands for industrial raw material, but forests play an enormous role as part of climate policy and the maintenance of biodiversity. In the fight against climate change, they are an invaluable carbon sink and carbon storage. From the point of view of biodiversity, they are home to a huge number of species, and most of Finland's endangered species live in forests. In addition to environmental values, forests have value from the perspective of recreation, tourism and leisure activities. In the end, it is also about the fact that forests, as part of nature, have absolute value. These diverse values of forests tell us how forests are a lifeline, a lifehole and also a cause for pride. We should therefore find more and more ways of measuring forest values than the productive value of wood. For these reasons, it is important that our forests are managed well and wisely. Now we have received a citizens' initiative here to move from open felling to continuous farming in the forests of the state. I believe that this citizens' initiative is important, and I would like to thank the authors and all those who have signed it. The state is Finland's largest forest owner, and the state countries cover about a quarter of Finland's productive forest land. In open felling, the mature forest is almost completely cut down: usually a few trees are left to safeguard diversity and a new seedling is planted or sown. In continuous growing, the forest is not renewed and grown as one generation of trees of equal age, but wood of many ages is removed at a time. Open felling is not done, but the forest is always more or less covered. In principle, new seedlings are not planted, but the forest is naturally regenerated. In continuous forestry, management methods are also flexible according to the situation and the objective. Then why is continuous education a good thing? Firstly, it will help to safeguard the diversity of forest habitats, to promote the recreational use of forests better, and also to combat climate change. Continuous farming also supports increasing the processing rate of the forest industry, as it helps to grow as many forest trees as possible into valuable logwood. The Left Alliance supports the move towards continuous farming in the state forests where this is possible. In principle, we should move on to continuous rearing, and this is particularly the case with peatland forests. The method of continuous farming in forests can increase ecological sustainability, protect the carbon stock from peat and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide from it. At the same time, the methods of continuous education must also be supported in private forests. The Government is also committed to improving forest management. I myself was allowed to sit at the table in the government negotiations where a number of measures relating to the use of forests were agreed. The Government now intends to update the ownership policy guidelines of Metsähallitus in order to better coordinate sustainable forestry, wood availability, biodiversity, recreational use, climate policy objectives and different forms of land use. The Government has stated that Metsähallitus' annual revenue target will take better account of the impacts on carbon sinks and biodiversity in addition to the need for forestry and industrial wood. A sink target is set for Metsähallitus. The natural management of economic forests will also be promoted, and the Government is committed in its programme to promoting methods of continuous education in Metsähallitus countries. Mr President! Finns are not in favour of open fellings. I, too, have experienced the sudden turn of the familiar forest of my childhood’s cottage landscape into an open felling window. I have seen open felling openings in Finland as well as cutting targets for continuous breeding. Of course, the abandonment of open felling does not mean the cessation of forestry, and no one has proposed this. However, this initiative contributes to the fact that people are not satisfied with the current management of forests. According to Yle’s news published yesterday, the calculations of the Natural Resources Centre show that Finland’s carbon sinks are significantly lower than expected in 2035. This further underlines the importance of climate-wise forestry policy. State forests are the property of all of us. It is important that this national property is used sustainably in view of the diverse environmental and recreational values of forests."", ""Mr President! For us downtown people, forests have a special meaning. Forests are a central part of the city centre's realistic greenness. Forests are a source of economic and well-being. The forest is a carbon sink. It is a source of recreation and strength for the Finns. Sustainable forest management is the best climate work. The Centre Party wants to seek both the strengthening of carbon sinks and new investments in increasing the use of wood in Finland. Well-managed and growing forests strengthen carbon sinks and produce more and more fossil substitute raw materials. The goal must be to move from a fossil economy to a bio-economy in Finland, and that is why we in the centre are very pragmatic about the use of forests. I have a great deal of appreciation for forest owners, logging and timber transport professionals, forest industry workers and those excellences who develop new cutting-edge products from wood-based raw materials. The sustainable use of forests saves the world, not destroys it. By 2050, Finland's forest growth can be increased to 150 million cubic metres per year. It requires investments in research, product development and forest management. The atmosphere is common and therefore both the use of forests and carbon sinks must be strengthened in a sustainable way. This has been done so far, and now it is all the more important when we try to get rid of the fossil economy. Safeguarding the diverse nature of forests and preserving nature are at the heart of my overgeneration of thinking. President! In my opinion, the various forms of forest use are not contradictory, but compatible with the growing bioeconomy. Finland can be made an example of a successful combination of economic exploitation of forests, recreational use and natural values and the fight against climate change. In this case, we will also take care of the Finnish good and skilled 650,000 forest owners. Sustainable forest management is therefore the best climate work. We must aim both to strengthen carbon sinks and to invest in increasing the use of wood in Finland. President! Metsähallitus plays an important role in Finnish land ownership, forestry, natural sports, tourism and various conservation measures. The Metsähallitus manages 12.5 million hectares of our land area. The Centre Party wants Metsähallitus to remain strong and responsible as the guardian of the land, forest and water assets common to all Finns. Forest taxation needs to be improved, and that is how we can make the market more effective. The functioning of the wood market and the competitiveness of forestry cannot be undermined by an excessively tight capital income tax. The gradual increase in forest reduction remains an objective, as it prevents fragmentation of farms, promotes generational exchanges and encourages the preservation of forest assets owned by Finnish families. President! Finally, the obvious: the centre does not accept the extension of property taxation to agricultural and forestry land.""]","<|system|>

Traditionally, the December European Council aspires, as the last appointment of the highest representative body of the governments of the European Union in the year, to clear signals and I dare say also to significant decisions on the priority themes of the European agenda. This European Council has a particular political significance, since it takes place five months before the elections for the new European Parliament. The European legislature has thus reached its final stage, which clearly restricts the possibility of translating decisions into a complete process with the current European Parliament and with the current European Commission. The European Council will also address the issue of Brexit, with a debate to 27, following the postponement of the vote of ratification of the withdrawal agreement by the British, which, as you know, was planned for today. After the debate in the House of Commons, the British Government calls for more reassurance that the Irish issue will be resolved within the framework of future relations between the European Union and the United Kingdom and that the reserve solution which, as we know, is provided for in the protocol to the withdrawal agreement, the so-called backstop, agreed by the negotiators of the European Union and the British last November, will not enter into force. We will then discuss this issue during the first day; I had a telephone conversation, after the break in the Chamber of Deputies, with the President of the European Council, Tusk, and we agreed that this will be the first topic we will discuss and therefore we will be better acquainted with the demands of British Prime Minister Theresa May. Let us look deeply at the democratic debate taking place in London, but at the same time, just over three months after the date set for Brexit, we must stress the need for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in an orderly manner, in the interest of providing certainty and clarity to the many citizens, including many Italians, and to the many companies involved in this process. In a context that still contains elements of uncertainty, we will therefore continue to work with European partners and with the institutions of the Union to prepare ourselves also for the scenario, which is not desirable for us, of withdrawal without agreement. The approaching end of the European legislature also sees a growing influence on the decision-making capacity of the Council of the urgent need to deal with the ever closer political budget that European citizens will mark with their vote which, as you know, is scheduled for the end of May 2019. At the European Council on 13 and 14 December, therefore, due consideration will have to be given to the wider political horizon of a changing Europe in a transitional phase; a Europe of which the United Kingdom will no longer be a member in just over three months' time; a Europe in which citizens' expectations of being able to count on European and national institutions that guarantee greater equity, growth, work and security throughout our continent are increasingly clear and urgent. It is therefore with an approach inspired by the principle of responsibility, both for those who have elected us and for future generations, that we are pursuing the objective of a fairer and safer Europe, and we will work in this direction also in this final of the European legislature. The inevitable priority of working today for a better future for Europe is the main theme of the main issues on the agenda at the next European Council: the European management of migration flows, in implementation of the conclusions of the European Council last June; the impetus for negotiations for a new multiannual European budget (the so-called multiannual financial framework); and the prospects for the reform of economic and monetary union. The Eurosummit debate also includes a consideration which applies to our relationship with Europe with regard to the budget law. We must overcome a short-sighted rigorism which claims to combat instability by measures which, on the contrary, end up favouring it. In advancing banking union and monetary and economic union, Europe must pursue a balanced relationship between reduction and risk sharing. I also consider it essential that Eurosummit can launch a realistic debate over the coming months on the eurozone budget. It is now clear, especially after the financial crisis, that central monetary policy instruments need to be accompanied by an equally centralised fiscal lever, which will mitigate the trends in divergence and the effects of possible asymmetric shocks. The Eurogroup on 4 December unfortunately confirmed, when examining the Franco-German proposal in this respect, the clear distance between Member States. In particular, while there has been a willingness on the one hand to deepen the possibility of establishing a common budget for the purposes of convergence and increased competitiveness, on the other hand there remains a strong contrast of views on the assumption that the common budget should also be given the role of stabilisation. Therefore, the progress of this project must be carefully assessed, giving particular attention to all the profiles and passages that characterize it. With regard to the completion of the banking union, our vision requires that the reduction of risk should finally be accompanied by corresponding mutualisation measures. We understand that a different timing on two aspects is inescapable; we appreciate that a risk-sharing measure is to be introduced, which will be the common backstop for the Single Resolution Fund. However, the new postponement of the decisions on the deposit insurance scheme is for us the signal of a Europe that continues to be influenced by the markets rather than trying to direct them. With regard to the reform of the governance of the European Stability Mechanism, we maintain our reservations about an intergovernmental approach and reiterate that the roles assigned to the European Stability Mechanism must not irreversibly undermine the prerogatives of the European Commission, particularly in the area of tax surveillance. On the subject of migration, the European Council will have to examine the next steps, aimed at finally making concrete progress in the implementation of last June's conclusions. The text of the conclusions indicates that the Council will address the comprehensive approach to migration. Here I would like to reiterate to my fellow Europeans that it is time to finally follow the words of the facts and to give life to a regulation and management of migratory flows that is genuinely European. To be such, it can no longer circumvent the priority challenge of primary movements and the management of rescues at sea. In particular, the burden of managing landings can no longer be borne by the countries of first arrival and European coordination is needed - I have claimed this since the summer - since the landing phase. A mechanism for managing rescues at sea also requires a shared effort and joint actions, precisely in order to adhere to the conclusions of the June European Council, in three key components: firstly, the landing, which must see a shared effort by the Member States, with the coordination, of course, of the European Commission. Secondly, redistribution, on which I will reiterate the inevitable need for Member States (and not only coastal and therefore first-come) to take on a truly shared effort. I cannot accept what some Member States are proposing, namely the limitation of the redistribution of rescues at sea to the single category of persons entitled to international protection; such an option would, moreover, mean an additional burden on the landing countries, making it difficult for the effective European management of landings, rather than simplifying it, as the Member States are almost exclusively concerned about secondary movements. Third, which is also fundamental, concerns the repatriation of rescued persons who are not entitled to international protection. At last, we need to give substance to a Europeanisation of returns, for example through mutual recognition, at least in the Member States that wish to proceed in this direction, of the relevant decisions and through the use of development cooperation as an incentive for better cooperation with third countries. I say this in the perspective of that investment, first of all of political stabilisation and of impulse to growth, which I consider indispensable towards Africa, a continent towards which Italy shows particular attention, as also recently witnessed by my visits to Ethiopia, Eritrea, Algeria and Tunisia. In the same direction goes the Italian and European commitment to the stabilisation and development of the southern shore of the enlarged Mediterranean, region marked by humanitarian crises, recent conflicts, but also land of great opportunities, whose realization in terms of security and prosperity is our common interest to promote. Again with regard to migration, I will remind my fellow Europeans that Italy considers the reform of the Common European Asylum System to be unacceptable, because it is unrealistic in its actual implementation. Without the reform of the Dublin Regulation, approving the legislative instruments of the system already advanced would be a political vulnus to the logic of consensus and would, at the same time, be counterproductive at the technical level, precisely because of the link between the aforementioned instruments and the Dublin Regulation. We also consider it essential that there is finally adequate attention to the external dimension, including in financial terms. The trust fund for Africa urgently deserves substantial refinancing and the multi-annual financial framework negotiation must identify stable and effective instruments and mechanisms of no less scope than the one dedicated to the Eastern Mediterranean route in 2016. This means, in fact, a truly integrated approach to the Mediterranean routes. The reduction of landings in the central Mediterranean is, in fact, a result to be preserved, but not to be overestimated; in fact, we must keep in mind both the dynamics of the communicating vessels - which now sees prevail the route of the western Mediterranean, but tomorrow who knows - both the fragility of the Libyan situation or the complex aspects of the neighbouring countries, which can bring back from one moment to another increases in migratory flow. The Libyan case is unique, moreover, because it proposes to the European Union different actors and interlocutors compared to the protagonists of the routes of the eastern or western Mediterranean. This makes an integrated and balanced approach even more necessary, including on the financing and management of migration. I would also like to focus on the central Mediterranean for another crucial aspect of the European debate on migration: the updating of the mandate of Operation Sophia, which Italy has been demanding since the summer, in order to prevent the landings of migrants, rescued from the ships of the operation, from taking place only in Italy. On this issue too, all the Member States really need to ask themselves whether it is worth endangering an operation of great political value, primarily for the security of the Mediterranean, in order to reiterate a clear closure to an update of the mandate that Italy is asking for in order to finally obtain a shared effort on landings. A session on security and defence is planned at the European Council to examine the European Union's positive progress in this area, including the Common Security and Defence Policy Missions. Well, this debate must be linked to an impetus from the European Council so that the issue of updating the mandate of Operation Sophia can be resolved in a positive and timely manner. As far as the multiannual financial framework is concerned, the European Council envisages a debate on the possible temporal objective of concluding an agreement which traditionally takes a long time and a great deal of political and technical patience. Italy considers that the timing should not be at the expense of the quality of the negotiations. I am saying this because, in the face of the challenges facing Europe and affecting the citizens' confidence in the European institutions, we cannot take shortcuts that lead to a seven-year budget - this, as you know, is its duration - which is inadequate to what is at stake. Europe needs to spend better on new priorities such as migration, security, investment, research and traditional policies such as cohesion and the common agricultural policy. It must also open up to new own resources. European citizens of the next decade need a Europe that has real added value when spending European taxpayers' money. This need, which is now unavoidable, concerns both the aforementioned new priorities and instruments such as cohesion and the common agricultural policy, which guarantee effective socio-economic convergence and support for entrepreneurs in a key sector, especially for Italy and our economies exposed to certain effects of globalisation. Also on the multiannual financial framework I intend to reaffirm these Italian priorities with the pride of a country that is the fifth net contributor and that, as a founding member of the European Union, considers it essential to negotiate up to a modern Europe. In addition to these issues, there will be a discussion on not less important issues, such as the completion of the single market. The conclusions aim at a signal from the European Council to the completion of the single market by the end of the current legislative term. On the Italian side, it is considered essential that this impetus should also be directed towards the support that Europe must give to small and medium-sized enterprises. Disinformation is a complex issue, on which the debate aims for the time being to give a basis for political support to the work that the Commission will launch with an ambitious joint action plan just presented by the Commission itself. We are, therefore, at the beginning of a coordinated European effort, which we believe is necessary precisely because of the complex and plural nature of the problem. Italy intends to be the bearer of a vision according to which the challenge linked to disinformation actions, coming from a multiplicity of subjects, both state and non-state, requires a strategic, multidimensional and wide-ranging approach that also attaches importance to the educational and training processes to strengthen the resilience of our societies to the phenomenon and of course do not neglect the delicate profiles of necessary guarantee of freedom of information, essential foundation of our democracies. Finally, I would like to focus on external relations. On this front, the Council's agenda provides for the periodic information of Chancellor Merkel and President Macron on the state of implementation of the Minsk arrangements with a view to the decision in January on the six-monthly renewal of sectoral sanctions against Russia. Italy intends to be consistent with its approach to the European issue, but at the same time believes that sanctions are not an end in themselves but an instrument aimed at starting the solution of the Ukraine crisis. In this regard, it remains a priority for us, in this phase of increasing tension between Moscow and Kiev, exacerbated in recent days by the frictions of the Azov Sea, to work together with our European partners to promote relaxation and bring back the confrontation to the negotiating table. In the section devoted to external relations, the Council conclusions will also take note of the exchange of views of the leaders on the preparation of the summit between the European Union and the Arab League, scheduled for 24 and 25 February 2019, which in itself represents an important political signal of a Europe called to establish itself as a credible and responsible player in the international chessboard. For this reason and for the great sensitivities at stake, where the aspects of security, development and management of migratory phenomena are not excluded from the geostrategic context, it will be important to pay particular attention to the themes of the meeting and to the possible results, ensuring the right balance between ambitions and followed. Italy intends to propose itself as a privileged interlocutor, also given its geographical proximity to face together the cross-cutting challenges facing the enlarged Mediterranean. The issue of dialogue and consultation of citizens is an important issue and we cannot tackle it with a purely bureaucratic approach. For this reason, the Italian Government has wanted to examine in depth the ways in which it can effectively carry out the issue and has opted for a broader approach, i.e. the consultation launched in recent weeks to raise students' awareness of Europe. Finally, there is the issue of climate change. A reference is foreseen in the conclusions to a long-term EU strategy on climate change to be developed in the coming months on the basis of a proposal from the European Commission. This is a welcome wish for Europe to translate into concrete and sustainable policies. Our line on this issue is very clear, also from the reading of our Government contract: we are for the full realization of the contents of the Paris Agreement. Allow me now, in the margins of the communications on the next European Council, to share with Parliament some considerations with a view to another important step in comparison with the institutions of the European Union. Tomorrow I will go to Brussels to meet again President Juncker and other members of the Commission. Interlocation with the European Union, at this significant stage for the political, economic and social life of our country, is crucial. In these weeks I have never interrupted the channels of dialogue; I have worked to bring the positions closer together and to explain in all fora the coherence of our economic maneuver and its virtuous effects in the medium term on the fabric not only economic, but also social. I certainly do not intend to divert attention to the final budgetary balances which - as is well known - will lead to a deviation from the primary deficit. On the contrary, I have worked and I am continuing to work, even in these hours preceding my trip to Brussels, so that the costs of measures, especially those with the greatest social impact, can be quantified on a timely basis, with appropriate technical reports, and that the concerns of our interlocutors in Brussels are raised more clearly. I have already pointed out several times that in the budget law, which is currently being examined here in the Senate, we will take action, especially following the changes that will be made during the parliamentary process, on investment expenditure, of which I will also present a detailed programme tomorrow. I have also explained to the Commission the reforms that the Government has carried out and those that have begun. I will not go to Brussels with a book of dreams, but I will present a full spectrum of the reform project of this Government and, with the support of a thorough work of inquiry that I have personally and directly coordinated, I will confront on the numbers, in the awareness of being in possession of macroeconomic data to demonstrate that the economic maneuver of the Government has been conceived knowing well the Italian economic reality and has been structured in its contents to meet the specific needs of the Country [[Applause from the M5S and L-SP-PSd'Az groups]] ,of course within the scope of the rules and public finance constraints resulting from membership of the European Union and membership of the euro system. But neither tomorrow in Brussels, nor even more today in front of Parliament, I can only focus my attention on mere accounting data. With the elections of 4 March, the Italians have made a request - I would say an urgency - to stop the impoverishment and marginalization caused by the long adverse cycle of the economic crisis and by a process of globalization that has penalized large sections of the population. We have seen a progressive exclusion from the benefits of the associated life of an increasing number of citizens, a phenomenon that has called into question social rights that seemed to belong forever to the legal and social heritage of our democratic system. With the government programme we have therefore responsibly identified the concrete measures to reverse this trend decisively. The programme, alongside measures to support businesses and workers, proposes necessary and sustainable social equity measures. It is an urgent response to the different and multiple primary needs of citizens. And if we were forced to proceed with a deviation from the deficit initially planned, we certainly did not do so lightly, but precisely to achieve the goals that the Italians ask with overwhelming urgency. [[Applause from the M5S and L-SP-PSd'Az groups.]] I am referring to measures of social equity, welfare, income support, simplification and fiscal pacification, of inclusion especially in favour of the younger generations, who have suffered the most from the years of the crisis, because they have been excluded from the labour market, with consequences not only economic, but which seriously undermine the quality of their existence. This is a move that will make Italy grow, and not only with regard to GDP, but with regard to GDP integrated by fair and sustainable well-being (BES). [[Applause from the M5S and L-SP-PSd'Az groups.]] We built it with a view to development, economic growth, the modernisation of enterprises, technological innovation. We are convinced that all this must be achieved in a sustainable way, preserving, as far as possible, the order of social rights (from education to health) received as a precious legacy by the generations that preceded us. Certainly the rights cost - as Cass Sunstein teaches - but they are costs that democratic societies must bear if they truly believe in the primacy of the human person as value that transcends and surpasses all other interests and that cannot be sacrificed to pursue others, albeit legitimate, objectives. Italy has been the protagonist in the decisive steps in the history of European integration, has always participated in an inclusive and supportive sense in the solution of the political and economic crises that have been experienced by the other Member States. We believe and are an integral part of the European Union. That is why we are trying to make every effort to alleviate the concerns raised by the Commission. We have worked hard to explain our objectives on time, claiming the right to make an expansionary manoeuvre, with expenditure and investments planned to stimulate growth and productivity and to ensure stability not only financial but also social. [[Applause from the M5S and L-SP-PSd'Az groups.]] We are in the middle of a close confrontation, which we trust to be fair and equal, in the hope that - as always happens in the negotiations - we can find a point of balance and convergence. I remain confident in the success of the dialogue. [[Applause from the M5S and L-SP-PSd'Az groups and Senator Buccarella.]]"", 'Honourable Chairman! Honourable Riigikogu, ambassadors and guests! Once again, the time has come to set goals for the European Union. The European Union is not faced with a choice of whether or not to be, but more and more we need to answer the questions of whether the path chosen and the cooperation that has been done so far have been the right one. We need to explain more and more convincingly to the public the choices and decisions that have been made. Following the Brexit referendum, we launched the so-called Bratislava Process to make choices between openness and closure, between a global and a protectionist Europe. It is a process of finding solutions to burning problems such as security, internal security, the economy and employment. This certainly does not mark the beginning of a new, non-liberal era, nor is it a departure from European values and policies that have brought success to Europe. At the same time, we must face the truth that not all have gone excellently, and not all problems can be solved overnight and only at European level. The European Union, like all other political projects, is constantly developing. He\'s not perfect, but he\'s the best form of supranational cooperation we have. Honourable Riigikogu! The British\'s decision to leave the European Union really affected both Europe and the United Kingdom like a cold shower. The speech presented at the Conservative Annual Congress on 2 October gave the first explanation of how the new British Prime Minister, Theresa May, will see the future. Despite our hope that the United Kingdom would seek as close a relationship as possible with the European Union, this speech was very welcome to us. Although there is still about six months until the application is submitted and much can happen during that period, we still have to rely on the UK leaving. It is also quite unlikely that the model of future relations will be based on the current four fundamental freedoms or even the model of the customs union, as in the case of Turkey. The future can therefore lead to less cooperation with the British than with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Turkey, but I believe that more than just a free trade agreement. In addition, clarity is needed in the UK\'s involvement in other policies, such as justice and home affairs, and, of course, in the area of defence. I am, in spite of everything, an optimist and I hope that the final outcome of the negotiations will be balanced and that it will maintain as close a relationship as possible between us. However, some important conclusions can already be drawn. First of all, I can say that, in the near future, the most important thing is cooperation and results for the 27 Member States of the European Union, and only then will we have to deal with the Brexit negotiations. Secondly, we need to improve cooperation with the United Kingdom through multilateral organisations such as NATO, as well as regional and bilateral relations. Thirdly, leaving the British means leaving a very influential and like-minded Member State, which in turn means that cooperation between like-minded Member States becomes even more important when the speaker leaves. The sooner we accept that the referendum is not reversible, the sooner we can find the necessary solutions. Honourable Riigikogu! One of the main topics in the forthcoming Council discussions is free trade. During the last year, discussions on trade agreements between the European Union and third countries have repeatedly stalled. Although the European Union is the world\'s largest trading bloc, the state of the agreements between Ukraine, the US and Canada shows that we need to find a way to solve real problems and, unfortunately, also dispel the untrue. The European Union has been at the forefront of globalisation because free trade has meant creating prosperity for its citizens, fighting poverty in the world and also contributing to peace and stability through close economic relations. Estonia has won a great deal from free trade. At the same time, we also need to understand those for whom globalisation has caused anxiety and uncertainty and who have therefore become an easy target for populists today. The President of the Council, Donald Tusk, rightly said in Tallinn: we must provide citizens with additional security in order to remain as open as we have been in the past. It is therefore important that economic growth reaches everyone. Prosperity pie and economic opportunities do not become greater as a result of colca-atricism and do not contribute to additional welfare. Our future must be based on the possibility of creating, producing and exporting research-intensive services and products. I would like to quote here the recent Economist article: \'Consumers and workers suffer the most from trade barriers. A study of 40 countries suggests that the end of trade would lead to a 28% reduction in incomes and a 63% reduction in incomes among the poorest decile. "" If it were to be extended to new trade agreements and an even greater free trade zone, just as the end of trade would be very damaging, additional trade would bring great benefits. As you can see, those with relatively low incomes will win the most. Freedom and free trade do not mean freedom of rules or anarchy. On the contrary, we must be among the fronts so that global trade is both rule-based and rule-based and respects fair competition. It is therefore important that Europe continues to enter into agreements with co-ordinate countries, particularly developed industrialised countries, which help to promote world trade on a rule-based basis and are economically balanced. Honourable Riigikogu, good ambassadors! The weight of Europe\'s word in the world is largely determined by how good and strong its economy is. No one doubts that a large internal market is necessary for all European countries to remain competitive and successfully contribute to the global economy. Reforms in the markets for goods, capital and services must also continue in order for Europe to be able to engage in the digital economy. Different sectoral market regulation hampers opportunities to create economies of scale that are supported by e-commerce solutions and which, for example, have been successfully achieved in the US. Although the example is contagious, the best national market in the world is not enough. I am pleased that Estonia has the image of a successful and dignified digital state as a result of years of hard work. Many would like to be a little more cool than anything else positive. Among other things, Estonia\'s unusualness is fueled by a somewhat insane dream of combining Estonian and Finnish e-governance and our offer of value in the form of virtual residence, which has already aroused a wide range of interest. The Riigikogu has also played a very important role in creating Estonia\'s progressive digital design, especially as a leader in the collaborative economy. We have chosen, in my opinion, the very right way to embrace new technology quickly and to find solutions that support development. I believe that, through our own example, we have, among other things, managed to achieve that the creation of a digital single market, as a priority for the European Union in the short term, did not give rise to any major debate in Bratislava by signing a declaration. ""Digital"" already belongs to most of the vocabulary, which is because some countries still have a very strong accent. Ladies and gentlemen, As we know very well, the condition obliges. As a digital state, we have therefore proposed that the free movement of data in the future in the European Union should be a separate fundamental freedom. According to the solow productivity paradox, any basic technology, such as the internet, takes time to provide the full economic effect of productivity and well-being growth. No one doubts that the internet will change both the economy and society throughout. In order to achieve this goal, we need to create a legal and investment environment in the near future that will support the development of modern digital infrastructure, including, of course, in our north-east. We also need to ensure a regulatory environment in Europe that supports the data economy and is not hampered by location restrictions or other obstacles. This has to happen in a way that does not question the individual\'s right to privacy and does not create a situation that separates Europe\'s digital internal market from the rest of the world. The free movement of data, as the fifth fundamental freedom, allows it to be seen both as an enabler of all other fundamental freedoms and as an end in itself. Last week, a large Swedish communications company spelled the goal of creating a gigabit society in the territory of the terabyte. The second issue I would like to make sure to address in the context of the economy and the internal market is unity. Just as border controls within Europe hamper economic activity, so our cut-off is one of the most important glass ceilings in our economy. It doesn\'t have to be like this. However, changing the situation requires constant effort and commitment to the objective. I have already mentioned cooperation between Estonia and Finland in the field of e-governance development, which can lead to completely unique solutions for many countries. This Friday, a very determined work will result in a ceremony for the signing of the BalticConnector financing agreement for the Estonian-Finnish Energy Security Association. The European Commission finances this project quite uniquely at 75%. Our next energy security project is to create a fully synchronised regional electricity market, both in terms of market and infrastructure, which took a large part of my visit to Sweden and Denmark last week to explain. The first step is to carry out a study and to map technical and financial possibilities for connecting. I hope that this project will be feasible through Poland or the Nordic region already in the next budgetary period of the European Union. But, of course, technical work must be done, a long-term budget must be designed and solutions sought with the countries concerned. An equally important long-term project is Rail Baltic rail connection. Lately, it has once again caused a heated controversy, but I firmly believe that the writers have acted in good faith. A comprehensive examination of the project will ultimately do only good, even if it is difficult to reach full consensus on such a large-scale infrastructure project. The ongoing additional cost-benefit study will help to resolve a number of the issues referred to, such as the choice of route, profitability assumptions and expected trade flows. I would like to highlight here some important aspects of Rail Baltic that have been called into question so far. First, cooperation in the region. This is the largest cooperation project in the history of three or four countries. I would say that this is even a historic opportunity to connect the region with Western Europe. Although Estonia has, to a large extent, been the leader of the project, which may occasionally be reminiscent of reluctant taming, the interest of Finland and other countries in the project is also felt. It has once again breathed life into the dream of the Tallinn-Helsinki tunnel as well as inspired the Finnish business sector. To date, three Baltic countries and Finland are connected to the Imperial Railroad with Russian rail width. It has not been hoped that Russia would be interested in anything more than directing raw material flows through its infrastructure and \'Divide and rule! \' the implementation of the principle for East-West Corridors and Projects. It is therefore easy to create a situation where we are more competitive with other Baltic countries than with cooperation partners. Instead of opportunities, more problems are often seen. We need Rail Baltic to connect ourselves to Western Europe, both strategically, politically and economically. In ten years\' time, it should not be true to say that the Baltic countries are an anomaly in Europe, where the train can only travel east. The Rail Baltic route is strategically important to Europe as a missing link and it is quite obvious that the eastern-west direction of Europe is not prioritised or financed. Secondly, profitability and economic opportunities. Of course, construction itself creates new opportunities and can bring about strategic infrastructure investments in the region. However, this is not the main thing, even if it is the result of difficult compromises. The most important part of Estonia\'s trade and cooperation partners is precisely in Western Europe. The key to Rail Baltic\'s success is the ability to take over an important part of international trade between the Baltic States and other neighbouring countries, and also to create new and rapid mobility opportunities for the growth of passenger and freight transport. To achieve this, an optimal route, good quality of service, high reliability, modern rolling stock and equipment at transhipment stations, ports and logistics centres are needed to ensure rapid operations. The future infrastructure charging system will support the use of rail and the main benefit will not be as revenue from rail charges itself, but as future investments in industry and infrastructure. Even if the project seems profitable only on the basis of the region, the additional opportunities are not only within the region itself. For example, China is actively seeking new opportunities for container transport to Europe. Cooperation in the region, association with Europe and economic profitability are, of course, just two main arguments. I also believe that the exaggerations that have sounded in the public and caused fear of cutting Estonia apart, possible genetic stunts and other such things will all receive an appropriate level of response. The Riigikogu has a very important role to play in dealing with this issue during the coming season, as soon we will send a transnational agreement to discuss this hall, which will establish the politically and legally as strong a foundation as possible for the future of Rail Baltic. Honourable Riigikogu! Speaking to you last year, the focus was on the security of Europe and the various related crises that had taken the dimension of the existential crisis in Europe. And not only in the key to the ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine. The refugee crisis triggered by the conflict in Syria was taking epic proportions, and terrorist acts in Belgium and France eventually reached the Estonians very painfully. The unity and determination of the West proved to be key. In the migration crisis, we immediately realised that the security of European countries is very closely interwoven. All Member States are literally responsible for a high level of common border surveillance and therefore for each other\'s day-to-day security. The increased political attention and gear change in the migration crisis and the activities that pushed it from the same period last year have reduced the migration flows between Turkey and Greece by a total of 98% to date. The border is guarded on both sides of the border line and its effectiveness once again depends on the level of surveillance and the willingness to cooperate on both sides. Period 2015-2016 brought about groundbreaking changes. Cooperation and agreements with third countries, as well as a change of attitude within the European Union, will be particularly important in this context, enabling all policies and instruments to be adopted to address the migration crisis. This is a good example of what can be achieved in the short term by acting together and common foreign policy. Last week, the European Border and Coast Protection Agency started work on the border between Bulgaria and the border, helping to bring Europe\'s external borders under even better control. Although the Agency will start as a support structure for the resolution of the crisis, a comprehensive European Border and Coast Guard should not be excluded in the future. We can welcome the creation of the European Union border crossing information system requested by Estonia, which in turn has been complemented by the travel authorisation system to be introduced and the increased possibilities to influence migration from visa-free countries. In conclusion, I would like to thank the Estonian law enforcement authorities, who have contributed significantly to the joint operations of the European Union and have implemented the objectives of the migration plan smoothly. The result of our joint action could lead to the removal of controls throughout the Schengen internal borders. Honourable members of the Riigikogu! Regrettably, I cannot report that the Minsk II agreement has been complied with. No, it\'s not! Ukraine does not exercise control over its entire territory, just as the ceasefire is seemingly apparent. Russia will continue to wage war in Europe\'s eastern and southern neighbours and, to be honest, in part, in Europe itself, if we take all the means of warfare into account. Our eastern neighbor uses conventional and hybrid methods to advance, just as a hybrid car uses different fuels to move forward. Intervention with cyber tools in the presidential elections, funding of extremist parties in Europe, as well as their indoctrination in Crimea, undermining independent investigation of air accidents, propaganda, as well as spreading lies, all of this falls under the last description. It seems that the school bullying process has begun wherever possible. As a result, the situation has once again been described as a new Cold War, although Edward Lucas quite vividly described it in his book of the same name a few years ago. If the West is considered to be an existential threat by the Russian administration, then in fact, no one should be surprised that the objective is consecrating the means. What has changed, however, is the attitudes of Western public opinion. This is not only reflected in the assessment contained in the new global strategy of the European Union that \'Russia\'s activities in Ukraine and around the Black Sea in general have shook the foundations of the European security architecture\'. The ongoing cynical conflict between Ukraine and Syria, as well as the recent investigation of the plane crash, Malaysia Airlines 17 and many more have increasingly opened their eyes and forced the Western public to look at what is happening much more closely and closely. The refugee crisis is a direct consequence of the conflict in Syria. The picture opening in Aleppo is just appalling. Therefore, we in the forthcoming Council must probably be somewhat less convinced that, in any case, we must continue to keep the line we have so far in the case of sanctions, to be united, to be determined and to approach issues with a long view. Honourable Riigikogu! Although the European Union is not a defence alliance, it has been an equal security project since it was created to ensure the well-being of its citizens. Estonia\'s current applications are well in line with recent developments in the field of defence. I say right away that I do not think the creation of a European army is on the table right now, and we should not waste time in the shadow boxing. I recall that NATO, too, does not have an army; it is the Member States. For the first time, starting a meaningful debate on European defence, formulating a task beyond our control, can actually achieve the opposite effect to what we want. At the same time, greater commitment to protection is no longer a taboo issue; it is one of those issues where more cooperation is clearly sought. Estonia should not be allergic to the development of the European defence issue, restricting itself to the opinion that it should not duplicate NATO. Indeed, we should not be spraying our efforts, but we should look at this as an opportunity, because it is possible to find places where the European Union can add value to what is already being done. Since more cooperation is needed in defence matters, there is no doubt one important consequence of Brexit. I recall, among other things, that three of the four NATO Framework States will soon not be members of the European Union. Hopeful developments in the reunification of the north and south of Cyprus will soon remove an important barrier to defence cooperation. As an example of terrorist acts in Paris, we know that the European Union solidarity clause offers additional opportunities. The management of the European Union\'s military and civilian operations could also be made more effective in order, inter alia, to remove the burden of external operations from NATO and allow it to focus even more on its core tasks. There are other areas where cooperation can be better, such as defence procurement, research and innovation research, as well as the availability of civil solutions in defence forces in the European Union, such as maritime surveillance, maritime rescue, satellite navigation, etc. The European Union\'s hybrid strategy must be implemented and, in our view, a broad-based cyber strategy could also be renewed, where the European Union also has a very important role to play. Good Riigikogu! This is an important, perhaps even critical, time for Europe, and the Estonian Presidency of the Council of the European Union will also be crucial. This means that, above all, we have the pressure of time to conclude negotiations and to conclude important political agreements. I believe that I paused enough curtain from the contents of the Estonian Presidency, because we are dealing with the economy, security and Brexit, as well as many of the other issues mentioned during the Estonian Presidency. The topics that are important to Estonia are well reflected in the work plans of the institutions, both in the Council\'s strategic plan and in the European Commission\'s work programme. Before the Riigikogu there are very important drafts for the development of Europe, such as the Paris climate agreement and the free trade agreement with Canada. However, the time has come to talk more detail about our priorities in front of the big hall, in the late spring of next year, when the Maltese Presidency has already come far enough. We are actually very well aware of most of the issues and drafts, which is why I hope that there will be meaningful discussions on the programme of the Presidency in the Committee on European Union Affairs and, of course, in all the committees in the field. Estonia will have one Presidency programme at a time, which reflects important issues for both the government and the parliament. The joint programme supports the achievement of the objectives and allows us to reach a consensus in order to give priority to our Presidency in the second half of the year. In cooperation with the Riigikogu, we hope to find a suitable working method in the near future also during our Presidency. On the basis of the recent report by the worthy international think tank \'Cohesion Monitor\', we can safely claim that we have gone the longest route to European cooperation between 2007 and 2014 and are one of the most cooperative Member States following the founding members of Belgium and Luxembourg. The Presidency is certainly the most important management challenge for the Estonian opening sector so far. Its success depends mainly on its ability to enter into agreements and to move the joint matter forward. The European Union is like a coalition government with 28 members, which cannot be effectively managed by rape and fisting on the table. Patience, wisdom, diplomacy, presence and empathy are the qualities to which every minister, every public official, must strive to lead the European Union. And the fact that Estonia was ready to pick up the baton of the British Presidency is a very good example of cooperation and leadership. It is also accompanied by the ex-post recognition that we started preparing early enough. As a result, there was no cramp, the necessary drafts for the Presidency reached Parliament in good time and the actions were re-upgraded. I very much recognise the courage of the Riigikogu, because your burden has essentially doubled. I hope that this courage will continue in spite of the local elections next year, and the Presidency will be accompanied above all by domestic peace and consensus. A successful Presidency must be a common goal for all of us, because only together can Estonia be made bigger. Thank you.', ""Honourable President of the National Assembly, honourable Members and Members of Parliament! Europe may have been at a crossroads more than ever. In the midst of the economic and migration crisis, the situation in the immediate neighbourhood and the crisis of running on the old continent, there are increasing differences. In the absence of effective common solutions, the place of uncertainty, egoism and harmful populism is widening with the passiveness of countries not directly involved in the current crisis. That reminds us dangerously of some other times, times we certainly don't want. It is for this reason that the fundamental values on the basis of which European integration has emerged need to be more aware. I am primarily talking about peace, security, solidarity and a sense of fellow man. If ever, now is the time for unity to work together to find the right balance between humanity and security, saving and the social state, between peaceful policy and the demands of the international environment, to participate in crisis resolution missions. It is time for common sense and a constructive search for solutions, both at home and in Europe and throughout the world. Your Honor! In such an environment, it is, of course, difficult to plan for one year and a half in full confidence, but under the Cooperation Act between the Government and the National Assembly in European Union matters, the Government has the task of preparing guidelines for the functioning of the State in the institutions of the European Union every 18 months. We must take into account the broader framework that the European Commission's work programme and the Tria Presidency programme of the Council of the EU are linked to each time. This declaration has been the tenth in line since Slovenia is a member of the European Union. The proposal for a declaration, which has already been discussed in more detail in the home work bodies, sets out the key priorities and guidelines that Slovenia will follow in its work in the EU institutions. Allow me to briefly describe some of the key topics that will undoubtedly mark the European Union and the position of Slovenia in the next year and a half. First of all, it is imperative to highlight the most pressing topic, which is, of course, far ahead of the work of both Slovenia and the European Union, that is, the migration crisis. Slovenia has always advocated comprehensive European solutions based on the spirit of cooperation and solidarity. Even at a time when the latter had to be cut off after less popular short-term responses, we did so. We are recognised by many at international level by the principle, consistency and constructiveness of our efforts, so we are once again active in the international field. Unfortunately, everyone does not respect enough European values and commitments. Some in the public still advocate one thing, but they practice something completely different. This has to be done. Migrants must be clearly told at the beginning of the dangerous journey what they can expect at the end. In our search for solutions, we are primarily working towards common responses that strengthen the efforts of the European Union to achieve its achievements. It is high time that we immediately establish the normal functioning of the Schengen area, return to the full exercise of the control of the Schengen borders and thus remove the reasons for any extension of internal border control. This will also be my key message at the leaders' meeting next week. At the same time, care must be taken to ensure that there is no possible humanitarian disaster or friction in the Balkans. That is why we have been actively working for a long time on closer cooperation between the Western Balkan countries, both at political and operational level. And in doing so, we constantly stress the necessity of aid to Greece and Macedonia, which are most at risk. Above all, it is also necessary to help those who, of course, need help. The flow of irregular migration must be halted and replaced by regular migration, so that they can be more humane. Indeed, the agreed transfers of those eligible for protection and the consistent return of those not should be initiated. In the long-term resolution of the migration crisis, the active role of Turkey is crucial. It is true that Turkey is already very burdened by the migration crisis itself, but it is also true that it can do much more in its resolution. We therefore need other, complementary or complementary solutions to address the migration crisis. It is still crucial that diplomatic efforts continue to address the causes of the migration crisis, which will also be one of the important objectives of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy in the next 18 months. The end of the conflict in Syria, the military and ideological defeat of DAESH and ensuring stability and security in the Middle East and North Africa are key objectives. But, of course, that's not enough. The resolution of the migration crisis must take into account the fact that many people are leaving their homes also due to poor economic conditions, poverty, human rights violations and ever-increasing climate change. To address these challenges, much more attention should therefore be paid in the future. The fight against smugglers and illegal trafficking in human beings will take ever more effort. Slovenia has already participated in these European Union operations very early in the Mare Nostrum and Sophia operations in the Mediterranean. We will continue to work in all our activities to establish and ensure a secure global environment and to effectively address the most crisis and acute focal points. A holistic approach to the European neighbourhood, which has turned into one of the world's most unstable areas in recent years, will continue to be an important aspect of the European Union's foreign policy activities, as well as of Slovenia. In doing so, it will be essential to pay particular attention to the future of the European Union's relations with the Russian Federation, both in the context of the resolution of the Ukrainian crisis and in the context of cooperation in action in the Middle East crisis areas. The wider view of the European Union must not simply respond to changes and current threats in the world. It must be more proactive and consolidate its role as co-creator of a secure and stable international environment. We want a strong European Union common foreign and security policy that ensures partnership with other global actors and works towards promoting stability, respect for the rule of law, human rights and sustainable development in the world. We will therefore continue to participate actively in the preparation of the European Union's global strategy, which will be presented by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy of the European Union to the European Council in June. In its consideration of current developments, we cannot go beyond the issue of terrorism, a series of terrorist attacks in recent months have shown the ability of terrorists to prepare, organise and implement violence against civilians in the region and also in the European Union. We can say that, in the EU, in the fight against terrorism, by adopting several important measures from words, we have moved on to very concrete actions. Among these is the new platform for combating terrorism and radicalism in the Western Balkans, which is a particularly sensitive region in Europe. The platform was created on the basis of a Slovenian initiative and we intend to continue to be very active here. Your Honor! In these very difficult times, we need a strong and undivided Europe. At the last European Council, we were able to agree on a solution to the British requirements for reform of the European Union. This is a very important signal that in difficult circumstances the Union is also able to act unitedly and find common solutions to very difficult strategic issues. The compromise agreement does not jeopardise the fundamental values and principles of the European Union, nor does it jeopardise the further development of the Economic and Monetary Union. It also takes into account Slovenia's concerns about limiting the free movement of workers and compliance with the basic Treaties of the European Union. The Slovenian interests are therefore ensured here. I believe that the membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union is in the mutual interest of the whole of the Union and its citizens, so I hope that the decision at the June referendum in the United Kingdom will be in favour of confirming membership in the European Union. I also believe that Europe must look forward together, focus on everything that connects us, and not on what separates us. This is the only way to remain competitive in the global world, to develop in line with common values and to respond effectively to many challenging common challenges. To date, any crisis in the European Union has been followed by a smaller or greater qualitative leap. I am also striving to see the current challenges followed by further progress in deepening integration. There must be no doubt here, Slovenia will be part of these processes. Therefore, we will also continue to advocate further deepening the economic and monetary union as a guarantee of greater stability in the euro area. This is certainly the most effective instrument to prevent new crises in this area. Dear Members and Members! Unfortunately, the debate on the present, which we live as a country and as a member of the European Union, is dominated by topics that are urgent sometimes, even if I have a somewhat graphic expression, by fire-fighting responses, but at the same time, we are still working a little less under the headlamps actively in areas that were not long before being the main core of European integration measures. In the Government's proposal for declarations and priorities, these things are also consciously recorded and will be taken into account in our further work for sure. Let me just touch them briefly in this presentation. Among the most visible achievements of the European Union and the symbols of European integration, where much further work is needed, is a single internal market where the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital is enjoyed by more than 500 million consumers and 20 million small and medium-sized enterprises. For Slovenia as a small and open economy, functioning in this internal market is essential as our companies create almost three quarters of their exports on the markets of the Member States of the European Union, so we will continue to seek to strengthen and deepen the internal market, including digital and to facilitate cross-border operations. This certainly has a positive impact on the competitiveness of the Slovenian economy and thus on faster economic development and the creation of new jobs. External trade is one of the key tools for promoting economic growth and employment. The next year will be a turning point in this area in a number of ways, as the European Union will enter into the final phase of negotiations on some important but politically sensitive agreements. In the negotiations, we explicitly advocate both the preservation of the right to regulation in the public interest and the preservation of the level of environmental, social, labour, health and other standards of the European Union and Slovenia. In particular, we are inflexible in the areas of agriculture and safe food. We are also firmly in favour of our views on the settlement of disputes between the State and the investor. Negotiations are of great interest to the public and therefore as much information as possible is needed in the course of these negotiations. With better information and an exchange of views, we face both the economy and civil society. Of course, the State Assembly is also informed of the state of negotiations. Slovenia is a country that lies at the crossroads of important transport links. The port of Koper has an unequivocal role not only for Slovenia but also for Europe as a whole, in particular for Central European countries. The railway connection between Koper–Divič is of paramount importance in this respect, due to the integration of the Slovenian and European economies with overseas countries mainly with Asia. That is why we want funding for the construction of the second track also to be provided through the European Fund for Strategic Investments of the so-called Juncker Plan. Slovenia also has a strong link with the Western Balkans and wants to strengthen the 10th Pan-European Corridor, so we have taken the initiative to establish an Alpine-West Balkan Corridor with the co-signatures Austria, Croatia, Serbia and Bulgaria. The solid and European energy union in relation to climate policy is not only in the interest of the European Union if I now touch on this issue. Slovenian consumers are certainly in favour of being able to choose the most cost-effective energy suppliers due to open competition. Even better, it will be ensured that gas supply is secure so that we are not at risk of being exposed to individual European market suppliers. We need to be aware that the cheapest energy is the one we don't consume. It is therefore essential to promote energy efficiency and, of course, to switch to renewable energy sources. In the field of climate change, the adoption of the Paris Agreement is a major step forward. High political ambition must be maintained and appropriate time and content activities must be ensured to preserve the European Union's leading role in this area. There are therefore two important tasks before the Union and Slovenia in the next period. In the United Nations, Member States and the European Union will sign the Paris Agreement in April this year, which will then need to be ratified as soon as possible, while at the same time the European Union will start looking for internal measures to achieve 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It is important for Slovenia that the Paris Agreement enters into force as soon as possible and that the European Union adopts such measures as will also take into account our specific transport needs. For the European Union and the Member States, an important process of transition to a circular economy is also starting, which will allow new business opportunities and jobs, taking into account the sustainable use of resources. Slovenia took an important step by adopting the Framework Programme for the Transition to the Green Economy adopted by the Government last October. We support the European Union's single political orientation towards the circular economy and sufficient flexibility in defining individual rules for its implementation at national level. Dear Members and Members! Allow me to conclude by thinking about what we must be aware of by all political actors and all branches of government, both within our national borders and within our wider community, of course, which we are talking about today. The citizens' trust in the European project or in state institutions will not be established and guaranteed by the populism of some virtual democracy on the street that rejects all others and others. This trust can only be assured by deliberate measures that will effectively offer an effective response to the concerns and uncertainties of citizens and help them to understand the positive meaning of our constitutional and European values and our common vision. Thank you.""]","<|system|>

Gentleman’s contribution. We have been discussing many aspects of the various goals that, as a Parliament, we are united in supporting, and climate change is part of that mix We have been reminded that the delivery of aid is not an end in itself; it is the means by which we commit to working in partnership with global and local organisations to eradicate the conditions that trap millions of people in extreme poverty. Aid should provide a ladder, and it should be the means by which we give our brothers and sisters in less fortunate circumstances a hand up, not just a handout Our objective should lead to actions that ultimately lead to a day when there is no requirement for international aid on the scale that is now needed. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke), who reminded us that the case for international aid needs to be made over and again. It is an easy headline in certain newspapers to be critical of international development, but to assume that everyone agrees with that would be a grave political mistake. We should be deeply proud that the 0.7% budget speaks loudly to the kind of country we are We make and keep our commitments in this country, and we are a dependable partner. If our reputation and influence in the world is based on one thing, it is based on trust. That is why the UK is recognised as a global superpower in soft power. The UK has played a principal role in the post-war era in laying the foundations of the rules-based international order. Whatever disparity there may be between the words and actions of other nations, we in the United Kingdom must be true to our word and stand by the poorest people on the planet I do not have the expertise and experience of others who have spoken in this debate, but I am keen to add my voice, and I think the voice of the vast majority of my constituents in Stirling, to those in this place who advocate positively for our international aid budget. It is right that the United Kingdom takes deep pride in its contribution in these areas. UK aid has a momentous global impact, but it is also right that we continue to apply all the necessary scrutiny of how our aid budget is spent and what it is being spent on, because it should be evaluated in the context of the essential work it is charged to deliver. We must measure the aid budget in terms of value for money in reaching its strategic objectives. In other words, although we may talk about how money is spent, it is vital that we measure outcomes These activities, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield alluded to, cannot be viewed in isolation. It is a fundamental problem of all Governments that Departments tend to work in silos, and the work of the Department for International Development needs to be seen in conjunction with the work of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Ministry of Defence has been mentioned, but the Department for International Trade has not. There is a vital interplay between aid and our diplomatic influence, between aid and trade, and between aid and global security issues I, for one, welcome the Secretary of State’s introduction to the voluntary national review of the progress we are making towards the global goals, which was mentioned a few minutes ago. In that introduction, he pointed out that the UK played a key role in the creation of the global goals, which are aimed at making the world a fairer, healthier, safer and more prosperous place for everyone, everywhere by 2030, and that the Government are responsible for achieving the goals here in the UK, as mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Derbyshire, and for contributing to the goals in developing countries In his introduction, the Secretary of State described the goals as neatly fitting into five Ps: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership. He said those five Ps cover the most pressing issues of our time I am privileged to have seen some of the impact of the work being done with the money devoted to international development by this House. During a trip to Kenya last summer with Malaria No More, the hon. Members for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West) and for Eastbourne (Stephen Lloyd), my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Outwood (Andrea Jenkyns) and I stood on the frontline in the global fight against malaria. We visited outlying hospitals that lack even what we might consider the most basic essentials, but what they did not lack was love and compassion We saw mothers nursing their very poorly small children, including babies. It was a moving scene that will stay with me for the rest of my life. It did not half give us a real-world perspective of the challenges that we face, and that we obsess about in this place. It is not possible to experience what we experienced in Kenya in that one trip without leaving with two overwhelming resolves: first, never to lose sight of our need always to count our blessings; and secondly, strongly linked to that, a firm determination to do everything in our power to make sure the fight against malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis is consistently brought back to the forefront of our collective consciousness whenever and however possible A child dies every two minutes from malaria, and the global fight against malaria has stalled. That was part of the case for the sixth replenishment of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria, and the case for investment has never been more compelling. It was with no small sense of emotion that I heard the Government’s announcement at the weekend that we have committed £1.4 billion to the Global Fund over the next three years to provide life-saving therapies and treatments to more than 3.3 million people with HIV, to provide TB treatment and care for 2.3 million people, to provide 120,000 people with treatment for multi-drug resistant TB, to distribute 92 million mosquito nets to protect children and families from malaria, and to strengthen health systems and promote global health security I feel grateful and proud to say that the UK has answered the call to action, by uplifting our commitment to the Global Fund by the 15% that was asked for. The richest nations on Earth should make the same commitment, and they should keep that commitment. Two million lives will be saved because of the UK Government’s announcement Behind these statements and commitments, I can still clearly see the dedicated community health volunteers, doctors, nurses and families we met in Kenya—the real people we need to help. Seeing the impact that the UK has made on this challenge gives me a sense of pride. Not only are the teams of specialist medics, logisticians, geographers, academics and many more mostly comprised of British subjects, but the money committed by the UK is a major contributor to the accomplishment of this work. It is also a field in which innovation is happening because of the work of UK aid and its partners. Since 2002, the Global Fund has helped save more than 27 million lives and reduced deaths from the killer infectious diseases of AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by more than a third in the countries in which it invests We must not be in any doubt about what other countries are doing in international development. China has its belt and road initiative—BRI—which is about much more than just building roads; it is about building all kinds of infrastructure around the world. China is doing this to gain essential access and influence in some of the countries that most need help. The Chinese model for international aid, the BRI, uses Chinese labour and Chinese finance for these projects, many of which are done on the basis of commercial or sub-commercial loans. UK aid works alongside local communities to develop aid projects and pursues proper development. I would hope that the Minister might add something in her wind-up on what we will do in response to the BRI and explain our strategy for meeting its challenge, particularly in Africa.', 'My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, for tabling this debate and for his continued interest in the international development strategy. He made an enormously powerful introduction, and I am grateful for his kind words about some of the successes at the COP 26 conference just a couple of weeks ago The international development strategy will be the first statement of the UK’s approach to development since the creation of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. It will bring together our diplomatic and development expertise with trade and other levers, including our leading UK institutions and civil society, enabling us to set a high level of ambition The strategy will take forward our commitments in the integrated review, which set out that the UK is one of the world’s leading development actors, committed to the global fight against poverty and absolutely committed to achieving the sustainable development goals by 2030. In line with the integrated review, the strategy will have a time horizon to 2030 and beyond. We will focus our development efforts not only on the needs that exist today or that could arise from crises but on those areas where we can have the greatest life-changing impact in the long term. In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Collins, I say that it will be published next spring, and I am pleased to provide an overview of the Government’s current thinking in this debate Reflecting our integrated review, published in March, the strategy will respond to the trends shaping today’s international geopolitical context. I am keen to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Alton, that this includes China’s increasing assertiveness and the critical importance of the Indo-Pacific region. It also includes the ideological competition between freedom-loving democracies and autocratic regimes. It encompasses transnational challenges, such as Covid-19, climate change and environmental degradation, which deeply affect vulnerable and developing countries and require global combined action Many of these trends are felt more acutely in developing countries. The drivers of poverty and instability—such as institutional fragility, conflict and climate change—are increasingly complex and interconnected. Indeed, these issues often have the most devastating impact on the most vulnerable, while threatening global stability and prosperity for everyone Against this backdrop, the integrated review makes it clear that the UK will remain a major development player. With this strategy we will work to reduce poverty, tackle climate change and address humanitarian crises, while bringing more countries into the orbit of democratic, free-enterprise economies. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans and a number of other speakers pointed out, this is not an add-on to the rest of the business of government or a box-ticking exercise; this is absolutely critical. The work of the FCDO on development is fundamentally right but also fundamentally in our own interests. One only need consider climate change, which is clearly the defining international challenge of our lifetimes As set out in the integrated review, tackling climate change and biodiversity loss is the Government’s number one international priority over the next decade. As COP 26 presidents, only last month we brought the world together to finalise and build on the Paris Agreement. Although clearly there remains a big gap between where we are today and where we need to be, there can be no doubt that we narrowed that gap considerably further than anyone had anticipated or predicted, and we have indeed kept alive the possibility of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees. We saw significant and meaningful progress with net-zero commitments in the final negotiated text, which was agreed by all 197 parties. Indeed, we now have net-zero commitments for over 90% of the world’s economy—up from 30% just two years ago, when the UK took on the COP 26 presidency There is a clear recognition that we cannot tackle climate change—or, indeed, a whole range of other issues, including the sustainable development goals—without massively increasing our efforts to protect and restore nature. Of course, that is true of climate change, but also of poverty. The noble Lord, Lord Balfe, mentioned Ethiopia. There are all kinds of complex causes that have driven Ethiopia back into the dire state that it now finds itself in. But one of those causes, undoubtedly, is pressure on the environment. For example, increasing desertification and acute water insecurity are both fundamentally environmental problems that need addressing We know that the commitments secured at COP will count for nothing unless we continue to ramp up ambition and until those promises are kept. I absolutely assure the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, that that is our priority this year. Our presidency did not end with the conference; it ends as we hand over to Egypt. While we hold the presidency, we will absolutely use every tool at our disposal to ensure that we can give meaning to the commitments made at COP Through the international development strategy, the UK will continue to ensure that our development offer helps to accelerate an orderly and inclusive global transition to a nature-positive, net-zero future, and we will continue to work with countries to enable the most vulnerable to adapt to climate change and reverse biodiversity loss. I am absolutely thrilled that the noble Lord called on the Government to align their whole ODA portfolio with our Paris commitments in his opening remarks. I strongly agree; indeed, that is a commitment the Government have already made. But I am very keen for us to go further and align our entire ODA portfolio not just with our Paris commitments but with nature. As part of our presidency over the next few months, I will be doing what I can to encourage other donor countries to do the same. Globally, ODA is about £140 billion a year. Tragically, a lot of our interventions on aid have been made at the expense of the environment, and therefore, I argue, at the expense of the long-term security, peace and prosperity of the people whose poverty we are supposed to be addressing The noble Baroness, Lady Bennett, made the point eloquently, as ever, and passionately that it is not just about new money or ODA. It is also about ceasing wherever we can to be enablers—I think that was her term—of destruction. There is no doubt that even if we were to double our aid commitment and all donor countries were to do the same, it would still be a drop in the ocean in terms of what is needed, not least to tackle climate change and environmental degradation In addition to our aid programmes, we need to do what we can to force an alignment between the finance sector and the objectives we are discussing today. We made progress on that at COP, not just in relation to Paris goals but in relation to nature. Financial institutions presiding over nearly $9 trillion of investments and assets committed to align with nature, and we will do what we can to hold them to that and increase that number in the coming months As we work to deliver sustainable growth and promote British expertise and influence, we will lean on our revamped development finance institution, British International Investment. This will deliver reliable, honest and transparent finance. It will support countries to export, trade and address the challenges that hinder investment, jobs and green growth, all the while creating new opportunities here at home. It will bring in billions in climate financing for projects such as solar power, sustainable transport and disaster-resilient infrastructure over the next five years Of course, no country can be truly free or prosperous without unlocking the potential of women and girls. That is a point that has been made extremely persuasively and eloquently by many speakers today. Tackling gender equality is a core part of the Government’s mission, and it absolutely remains so. The integrated review confirms this commitment, specifically working with women’s rights organisations to tackle the discrimination, violence and inequality that hold women back As the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, my noble friend Lady Sugg and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans have all pointed out, education is likely the single smartest investment we can make if we want to fight poverty, address climate change and save lives. We will absolutely continue to help countries to invest in strong education systems. At the same time, I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that we are not deprioritising in any way the inclusion agenda, particularly for older people, which she mentioned. We will continue our world-leading work to empower women and eradicate violence against them. In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Hodgson, I say that we will support sexual and reproductive health rights and work to end the barbaric practice of female genital mutilation In addition to our focus on women and girls, we are committed to promoting open and inclusive societies which respect human rights by tackling discrimination, with a particular focus on disability and LGBT rights, and breaking down the barriers to achieving equality and opportunity for all I agree with the comments made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans about the value of encouraging foreign students to come and learn here in the UK, for all the reasons he said, not least that those students are likely to return to wherever they come from in the world with a natural friendship with this country and bridges on which we will be able to continue to form partnerships The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, raised the issue of population. I certainly do not seek to downplay that issue; I do not think that anyone in government does. Clearly, numbers matter. The only thing I would say is that, in terms of the impact on Mother Nature, as the noble Viscount called it, the bigger issue is per capita consumption. If he considers that the environmental impact of the average Rwandan is around 40 times smaller than that of the average person living in this country, consumption clearly must be a key part of it. I also argue that our investment in and prioritisation of women and girls, particularly regarding reproductive autonomy, will be absolutely central if we want to tackle the issue of population. It is the only proven solution to the issue that the noble Viscount rightly raised Like a number of noble Lords, the noble Viscount mentioned Afghanistan in this context. Ministers and officials have met Afghan women regularly to inform our engagement on the future of that country. We believe that Afghanistan needs inclusive politics that properly represent the country; I acknowledge that that is clearly a long way from where Afghanistan currently finds itself While we support countries’ long-term growth, we must also, as many noble Lords have said, play our part as a global citizen, responding to crises and their causes; this point was made extremely forcefully by my noble friend Lady Sugg, the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and the noble Lord, Lord Londesborough. Ending Covid-19 and boosting future health security is, naturally, a top priority. We will continue our work to ensure that vaccines are available to those who need them. This includes our £548 million of funding for the COVAX advance market commitment, delivering more than 516 million vaccines to low and middle-income countries We will also continue work to enhance health systems around the world. It is vital to get jabs in arms, save lives and prevent future crises. For example, our support for Nepal’s health system has already helped to halve the rate of maternal mortality in 10 years and bring in an early warning system for disease outbreaks. This will be coupled with ongoing life-saving support for the world’s most vulnerable people, such as our support for humanitarian appeals in Somalia and South Sudan. Indeed, amid rising global humanitarian need, the UK remains one of the world’s top bilateral donors to some of the world’s largest humanitarian crises. The UK will use our position as a principled and effective humanitarian donor and a strong partner in the international humanitarian system to prioritise effective humanitarian assistance for those in greatest need and protect civilians, refugees and marginalised people. We must also work to prevent conflict and violence erupting in the first place, so we will continue to focus on building law enforcement and justice institutions that promote peace and stability I will briefly respond to the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Oates, which were echoed by others, about mines. The Global Mine Action Programme—GMAP3—is due to begin next year. It will involve landmine clearance and education to help affected communities keep safe, as well as capacity development for national authorities to help them address the issue in their own countries. Although I cannot provide details at this point, they will be provided soon We will continue to bolster our defences against terrorists, cybercriminals and money launderers, supporting capacity building in forensics and investigations In all this, we remain steadfast in our absolute focus on tackling poverty through promoting economic growth and employment opportunities. Of course, this also benefits the UK by creating new markets where UK businesses can trade and invest. I note the comments from the noble Lord, Lord Desai, on the ineffectiveness of some aid. Of course, some aid has been poorly invested over time; an enormous amount has been invested. Equally, though, the proof of the effectiveness of investing in, for example, girls’ and women’s education, or some of the environmental initiatives that I have seen closely at first hand, is demonstrated beyond any doubt in the impact they have. For example, areas in the world that are hit by unfortunately ever more frequent storms have been visibly and measurably protected as a consequence of repairs to mangroves and corals. You can literally see that, for the communities that still have either old or regenerated mangroves compared with those that do not and rely on concrete defences, the difference in protection is night and day. That is one example of where investment has proven itself to be effective, but there are many others In responding to new challenges, we will consider not just what we work on but where. We will focus our investment and expertise where we can make the most difference, achieving maximum impact and value for money. We recognise that some of the issues we care about most, such as climate change, particularly affect some of our most vulnerable development partners. Our approach will therefore be different in different countries, tailored to local needs and taking account of the fact that, as countries become more prosperous, they are better able to manage their development As has been noted, we will extend our development reach, tilting towards the Indo-Pacific—that powerhouse of the world’s future economy—and staying strong in Africa, where there are so many challenges and opportunities. This will be reflected in the strategy, of course. We remain completely committed to working with our partners in Africa to meet their goals. As well as humanitarian support, UK aid is helping to deliver the vaccines that are needed, educate girls, reduce crime, improve economic growth and development, and help countries in relation to their environmental challenges We will also continue to work with key countries and regions on specific issues. This includes tackling the root causes of instability in the Middle East and north Africa; protecting our planet’s natural resources in areas of incalculable importance, such as the Amazon and the Congo Basin; addressing drivers of conflict in the western Balkans; and supporting good governance and resilience to crises in our overseas territories.', 'My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady D’Souza, for introducing this debate and giving us a timely opportunity to make the case for the importance of UK aid and of continuing to spend it effectively First, I echo what others said in recognising the tremendous work the UK has already done and continues to do on the international aid front. We do it quite simply because giving aid is the right thing to do. More than 700 million people today live in extreme poverty. The challenges they face include food shortages, disease, natural disasters and conflict. Limited access to healthcare and education compounds and continues the cycle of poverty. We can help—and we do. The UK gives aid because it makes a difference. UK aid is effective. The charity ActionAid reminds us that UK aid has helped to immunise more than 55 million children against preventable diseases and provides 60 million people with access to water, sanitation or interventions to promote hygiene My noble friend Lord McConnell pleaded persuasively not just for such clear, immediate outcomes—good as they are—but for longer-term commitments that deliver wider-scale outcomes. I cite one particular programme that seems to exemplify this: in humanitarian aid, the UK led the way in tackling the Ebola crisis in west Africa. I have mentioned before in this House the expertise at King’s College London, which contributed so much to the UK’s role in helping Sierra Leone conquer this terrible disease. King’s strong background in global health and the creation of the King’s Sierra Leone Partnership meant it was able to step up its work in response to the Ebola outbreak, enabling it to treat an estimated one-quarter of the Ebola cases recorded in the country. But since then King’s has contributed enormously to healthcare capacity building in the region, demonstrating the vital role that university health partnerships can have in creating sustainable healthcare systems for the long term and globally. We should be able to demonstrate sustained benefits for the longer term in all our aid programmes It is to this Government’s credit that they have pledged to continue to meet the UK’s target of spending 0.7% of our gross national income on official development assistance—ODA, as it is normally referred to. This is entirely in line with the promises we made at the 2005 G8 summit. Of the 15 EU countries that made the pledge in 2005, only the UK and Germany have risen to the challenge since then. The UK was the first to meet that target—in 2013, before it became a legal requirement in 2015. As others have observed, the UK was one of just eight countries to meet that target last year. Indeed, eight of the 15 have actually reduced their ODA spending as a proportion of GNI since 2005. To meet our commitment, our ODA spending nearly doubled between 2005 and 2016, from £7.4 billion to £13.6 billion in today’s terms. To continue to meet that commitment, we will need to increase our ODA spending by another £1 billion from now until 2021 As we have heard, most of our ODA or foreign aid spending is done by the Department for International Development. Between 2010-11 and 2016-17, spending by DfID rose by 24%—at a time when budgets for departments other than health, education and defence were cut by an average of 28%. It is worth noting that bilateral aid makes up almost two-thirds of UK ODA. This means it goes to specific countries, regions or programmes, and spending is controlled almost entirely by us as a donor, unlike multilateral aid, which is channelled through organisations engaged in development work, with little condition on exactly how the funds are spent The recent IFS report, The Changing Landscape of UK Aid, highlights the fact that the UK—specifically, the Department for International Development—is seen internationally as, “a leader in shaping the global development agenda” Importantly, the report also notes that despite being one of the smallest areas of government spending, it is one of the most scrutinised. The International Development Committee, the National Audit Office, the Public Accounts Committee and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact all have a monitoring role to ensure that overseas aid is properly spent. DfID is rated in the highest category in the international Aid Transparency Index, and the most recent peer review of the UK aid strategy by the OECD in 2014 was largely positive about the UK’s performance. No less a philanthropist than Microsoft founder Bill Gates has said that DfID is, “one of the most effective, efficient, and innovative aid agencies in the world” I was filled with alarm, therefore, when I realised that the strategic focus of the UK aid commitment has shifted to support aid “in the national interest”. This approach seems to mean that when Britain is determining how it will meet its responsibility to the world’s poorest, it will make a judgment based on what, “best serves and protects its own security and interests” So while we are reducing poverty, we are also looking to improve the business climate and create international business opportunities for UK companies. I suspect that there will be huge challenges in the evaluation of the impact of these two very different aims. I cannot help but also feel that in our relationships with our partners overseas, it will be counterproductive. The noble Lord, Lord Purvis, raised similar concerns, and I will listen very keenly to the Minister’s response to his questions Money is being diverted to other government departments which may not be subject to the same scrutiny as DfID, as we have heard already. Between 2014 and 2016, there was a 12 percentage point drop in the proportion of the ODA budget received by DfID. In 2017-18, 20% of the UK’s ODA is due to be spent by departments other than DfID or by cross-government funds. That is set to rise to 25% by 2019-20. I feel this should be a matter of real concern, particularly in relation to evaluation, because while DfID is a world leader in delivering aid, the aid spent by other departments does not meet the same high standards. Where DfID was rated very good, the highest category in the Aid Transparency Index, the Foreign Office was ranked poor and the MoD very poor. How can we be sure that the Government will live up to their promise that all departments will follow the same high standards as DfID on fighting poverty? How can we be sure that they will remain transparent and accountable A further concern is the recent indication that international definitions of development assistance will be changed to, “better reflect the breadth of our assistance around the world”. Redrawing the definition of what constitutes foreign aid to include work that the UK already does abroad but which cannot currently count towards the 0.7% target has worrying echoes of the changes to the definition of child poverty a couple of years ago. The Government have built on a great track record of generosity from the UK and a strong reputation for effective aid. Will the Minister tell the House how he will ensure that this is not put at risk by poor evaluation of the impact of spend from other government departments?']","<|system|>

When I started my engineering career back in the 1960s, British steel was respected around the globe. From Bessemer’s processes to Goodeve’s BISRA stainless steel, Britain was the home of global steel innovation. However, no other nation has treated its steel industry the way that we have since. We did not just throw the baby out with the bath-water, we threw away the bath, the taps, the pipes and sewers. First, we had three decades of contradictory, inconsistent and underfinanced industrial strategies, then three decades of no strategy at all. That left us exposed so that the steel crisis hurt British producers more than our competitors. It is a global crisis. There are over 200 anti-dumping measures listed at the WTO against one country alone. We are at 30% global overcapacity and flat demand, yet steel capacity is increasing by more than 5% a year The world steel market is clearly distorted. So local action to ensure a level playing field for British producers is essential. I quote a former steel-worker on what must be done. He said that the Government needed to take “three tangible steps”: first, “ensure low exchange and interest rates”; secondly, reduce the “excess costs” that British steel faced versus its European competitors; and, thirdly, take, “urgent, quick action to bring in anti-dumping measures”. —[Official Report, Commons, 21/10/1998; col. 1201. ] Perhaps President Trump has been listening. The insightful former steel-worker was the Minister, speaking in 2001 More than 15 years later, we still need urgent action. Ministers described their own business rates policy as “bizarre” two whole years ago, but we still have not heard what will change. The Government said before the previous election that British steel-makers pay twice as much in energy costs as German firms, yet last month, we heard that action on the renewables obligation still needs European approval. In strategic industries, when times are tough, the Government need to offer fast relief. If European agreement is needed, why is steel a low priority in our Brexit negotiations I hope that I did not embarrass the Minister by citing his speech. I am delighted that he has been appointed to his job: we need Ministers with passion for their brief. Perhaps I may make amends by telling him that he has an ally in No. 10. The Prime Minister’s chief of staff wrote last year: “We do not have to accept ‘dumping’”, and has called our energy policy, “a monstrous act of self-harm” He seems keen to deliver the urgent action that the Minister wanted If we are to do more than just slow steel’s decline, our industrial strategy must look well past the current crisis. Since the end of the war, British steel has suffered from underinvestment and instability. We have created a short-term, inward-looking industry. In the 1970s, we spent about the same on R&D as France and Germany, but we did not implement the results. By 1980, we had the lowest proportion of continuous casting of any major steel producer. Under Governments of all parties, steel was left exposed and uncompetitive Even now, producers struggle with that legacy, whether on pensions—although we hope that that is now sorted out—or on business rates, energy costs or weak infrastructure. Tata Steel invested more than £1.5 billion since buying Corus. I was heavily instrumental in that. Much of it has gone to correcting the errors of the past. When Tata felt that it had to close last year, it was because it was losing £1 million a day. It knew that much more investment was needed. All it was offered by the Treasury was tea and sympathy. However, there has been some change in attitude in the past year That is why our steel industry has declined to the point where Canada, Poland and Belgium all produced more than us last year. This is not a case of a productivity gap—British steel workers are productive and flexible. It is very seldom that they have gone on strike. It is a lack of long-termism, investment and innovation which fetters them To put that right, we need to do three things. First, we need to focus on future market requirements. Total steel demand is stagnant, but demand for specialised and advanced, lightweight, high-strength steel will only increase. Further, as a mature market, we can anticipate future trends in reuse, recycling and steel waste. Excellence here will encourage foreign investment as carbon emissions come under greater pressure Secondly, we need better infrastructure and procurement. Port Talbot’s lack of proper port facilities hampers its exports, but there is little help for steel producers on future procurement by the Government. Finally, we need to do more to make our innovations impactful. We are doing globally significant materials research in the UK, and we need it to reach the market. The promised steel sector strategy should support investment in steel recycling, advanced materials and improved production processes. The research being done now shows that there are opportunities At WMG last month, one of our PhD students won the American Association for Iron & Steel Technology prize for best metallurgy paper by a student, for a paper given on peritectic steel. I would explain what peritectic steel is, but I am sure there is no need. The Economist noted last month that WMG’s research on belt casting and advanced materials could reduce energy used in steel production by one-third. We rightly hear of the need for more diversity in British science and technology; both the research projects that I mention are by women. As the Economist says, this kind of innovation is why producers are considering a new steel plant in the UK We need immediate action on this crisis. We also need to support long-term investment, anticipate future needs, increase the commercial impact of our material innovation, and protect our steel market against dumping. That is a huge problem, not just here but anywhere in the world. That is why Trump has just introduced anti-dumping measures. We have had enough White Papers; perhaps it is time for a little bit of white heat. To put this right, we must look at the future market requirements: steel demand is stagnant, but demand for specialised and advanced, lightweight, high-strength steel will only increase. Further, as a mature market we can anticipate future trends in reuse, recycling and steel waste. Excellence here will encourage foreign investment as carbon emissions come under greater pressure. Furthermore, we need better infrastructure and procurement. Now that the problem at Port Talbot has been solved, with the unions and owners agreeing on a 10-year strategy, the lack of Port Talbot’s facilities hampers exports, while there is little help to steel producers on future procurement by government Finally, we have to do more to make our innovation impactful. We rightly hear of the need for more diversity in British science and technology, so it is worth saying that both research projects that I mentioned are by women. That is the kind of innovation that we need, and perhaps that is why the Government should spend more time not on talking but on white heat.', 'I thank everyone who has spoken on this important topic this evening. We have heard some passionate speeches, not least just now from the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband), and I recognise the significant concern being expressed by all colleagues on behalf of UK steel producers Hon. Members heard the Under-Secretary of State for International Trade, my hon. Friend the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Jayawardena), clearly set out the role of the Trade Remedies Authority, which is sponsored by the Department for International Trade, and how its recommendation process works. The world has changed since 2018 when these powers were put in place, so my Department is very supportive of the Trade Secretary’s desire to review the domestic toolkit, given the challenges of global trade. At the same time, my ministerial colleagues in BEIS and I will continue to devote our focus to the future of this important sector. Although the global economic context is challenging, hon. Members will recall that the Secretary of State said when giving oral evidence to the BEIS Committee’s inquiry into the future of steel that the UK industry will continue to need high-quality steel and British steel is among the best in the world. Making sure our steel industry has the right conditions to thrive is a key part of our efforts to reach net zero and level up across our country There should be no doubt that this Government are committed to UK steel making, as the Secretary of State has affirmed, both at that session and on a number of recent occasions. We are already working to protect jobs and we are straining every sinew to ensure that the industry succeeds at securing a sustainable future. Our unprecedented package of covid-19 support over the past year is still available to the sector, to protect jobs and to ensure that producers have the right support during what has been and continues to be a challenging time My hon. Friends the Members for Scunthorpe (Holly Mumby-Croft), for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Miriam Cates) and for Redcar (Jacob Young), whom I know have all met the Business Secretary today to discuss the best way forward for the industry, will, I hope, be reassured about our commitment to our UK steel sector. As many hon. Members with close links to steel will know, the Government are working closely with industry and trade unions to understand how we can, together, create a sustainable future for the steel sector in the UK. We recognise absolutely that industrial users in the UK pay higher electricity costs than European competitors, which is why since 2013 we have provided more than £500 million in relief to help steel producers with electricity costs, and we are currently consulting steel companies on the future of such schemes As my hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Peter Gibson) highlighted, the Government’s £350 million industrial energy transformation fund will support businesses with high energy use to cut their bills and reduce carbon emissions. It is a fact that to reach our ambitious net zero target the UK steel sector does need to decarbonise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous) set out so eloquently. Our new industrial decarbonisation strategy, which is the first net zero-aligned strategy from a major economy, sets out, for the first time, the Government’s comprehensive assessment of how industry, including the steel sector, can decarbonise in line with net zero in a way that supports competitiveness and clean growth. As my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich East (Nicola Richards) highlighted, this is an important journey for the industry The strategy includes a commitment to work with the UK Steel Council, which the Business Secretary re-formed on 5 March and provides a forum to work in partnership with industry and the unions to develop a plan to support the sector’s transition to a competitive, sustainable and low-carbon future. In particular, we are working with the UK Steel Council to examine the implications of the recommendations of the Committee on Climate Change to set targets for steelmaking to reach net zero emissions by 2035. In 2019, we announced the £250 million clean steel fund to support the sector to transition to low-carbon iron and steel production through new technologies and processes, so I can reassure the right hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) that we have indeed got the steel industry’s back. This fund is currently in development and we need to take the time to design this policy. Complex decarbonisation projects have long lead-in times and the steel sector has indicated that its preference is for the fund to be launched in 2023 All that strong steel action is aligned with our prioritisation of science and innovation. We recognise the equally strong economic benefits of public investment in science and innovation, and in its capacity to leverage private investment. Because of that, we will increase public research and development investment to £22 billion per year from 2024-25. We also plan to establish a net zero hydrogen fund, with £240 million of capital co-investment out to 2024-25. This will support at-scale hydrogen production projects, allowing steel producers the potential to access supplies of low-cost hydrogen Decarbonisation is one top priority. Another one is resolving procurement challenges that the industry faces, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend (Dr Wallis) highlighted. We are working hard to ensure that UK steel producers have the best possible chance of competing for and winning contracts for all Government projects, including those like ships identified by my hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Lee Anderson), with his now famous colour. We have established a BEIS industry-led steel procurement taskforce co-chaired by the Minister for investment to explore what Government and industry can do to address the challenges the sector has reported when competing for public contracts More broadly, we recently consulted on an ambitious package of procurement reform with the aim of creating a simpler and more flexible regime that works much better for British businesses. The Cabinet Office has now published both the national procurement policy statement and a new procurement policy note on taking account of carbon reduction plans in major projects. BEIS continues to publish our annual steel pipeline, along with data from the previous financial year on levels of steel procured by Departments, origin where known, and compliance with the guidance on procuring steel This House should be in no doubt that the Government are working closely with the steel industry and have put our optimism for the future of our steel industry into action.', 'I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar (Anna Turley) on securing this vital debate today, and I also thank the Backbench Business Committee. Before I get on to the substance of my speech, I want to pay tribute to three gentlemen who are sitting in the Gallery. Roy Rickhuss is the general secretary of the Community union, and he is here with Alan Coombs and Dave Bowyer. Those three men are fighting with passion and dedication to secure a sustainable future for the British steel industry and I pay tribute to their professionalism and dedication today The UK steel industry and its associated metals sector comprise more than 24,000 enterprises and were worth more than £45.5 billion to the UK economy in 2012. The sector’s exports account for 150% of UK demand and steel is a driver of productivity that, along with other UK foundation industries, is characterised by sector productivity of 136%. I think the Minister will agree that steel has a clear strategic, economic and defence value to the country and is invaluable in driving sustainable productivity growth A foundation industry feeds into the supply chain of multiple other industries. From automotive to locomotive and aeronautical to power generation, from transmission to construction and from white goods to consumer electronics, the steel industry is at the heart of the British economy. It is no exaggeration to say that the quality of our national infrastructure and the future of the British economy go hand-in-hand with the future of the steel industry. The steel industry and its associated metals sectors are also a vital source of employment, accounting as they do for 330,000 jobs in the UK. In fact, three UK jobs rely on every job in the steel industry and those jobs are likely to be found outside London and the south-east, in regions where such jobs are desperately needed. Those jobs are exactly the type that we all want to see: highly skilled, with high value added, relatively high wages and a vocational field, with the potential for development and fulfilling career paths. In fact, it seems to me that the steel industry is a model of precisely the type of industry that all in this House should wish to promote if we are truly serious about wishing to create an export-led recovery, about solving the productivity puzzle and about rebalancing the British economy away from its dangerous overreliance on the services sector and towards a far more resilient manufacturing base. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, no less, has set a target of doubling exports by 2020. It is crystal clear that he will never achieve that target unless the country has a vibrant and sustainable steel industry The steel industry is also crucial to our prestige as a nation. Without a steel industry, would we even qualify as a leading industrialised economy? What would the loss of this strategic industry mean to our membership of the G8, for example I rise today not only to remind this House of the central role that the steel industry plays in our national economy and security. This industry also shapes the social economic landscape in my constituency of Aberavon. The Tata steelworks in Port Talbot is one of the largest in Europe; it is essential to the UK’s manufacturing sector and the beating heart of our community. As the Minister will know, as she visited the steelworks only weeks ago, the Port Talbot plant is a beacon of British-made manufacturing. She will be in no doubt about the dedication and professionalism of its 3,000 workers As I have mentioned, this is a highly skilled, specialised workforce, and this high-risk, high-skill work results in some of the highest-quality steel in the world. The super bainite steel produced at the Port Talbot works, for example, is used by the Ministry of Defence for such crucial projects as reinforcing the armoured vehicles that were used until recently in Afghanistan. I am deeply proud of the fact that this ultra-specialised type of steel has saved lives in war zones and is made by my constituents The steel industry has a proud past and a vitally important present, and it should also have a truly promising future. It is therefore with deep regret that I rise today to make a speech that I hoped I would never have to make. I believe that the steel industry is on the brink of collapse. This is not rhetoric; it is reality. For a number of reasons, as other hon. Members have said, the industry is now caught in a perfect storm. Let me briefly outline those reasons First, cheap Chinese steel is distorting the market. For the first six months of 2015 the amount of Chinese steel imported into the UK increased by 120%, relative to the same period in 2015. The fact is that the global steel market is now comprehensively saturated by Chinese steel, and the impact is impossible to exaggerate. It is literally squeezing British steel out of the global market and is the primary cause of the parlous state in which the British steel industry currently finds itself. Secondly, the pound is stronger than it has been for many years. Some 40% of total steel sales are exported to the EU, and for every sale in euro, Tata Steel now receives 20% less in sterling than it did just 18 months ago Thirdly, there is the high cost of production here in the UK, which can be attributed largely to the crippling costs of energy bills. Steelmaking is an energy-intensive activity, and the cost of energy in the UK is twice as high as in any other EU country, despite the fact that those countries face precisely the same regulatory costs charged at EU level, such as the EU emissions trading system. UK energy costs are a massive barrier to companies that wish to invest in the future of their business and the skills of their workers The net result of this perfect storm is that Tata Steel is facing a deficit of just over £250 million for the year 2014-15, reflecting substantial year-on-year losses since 2011-12. Despite this, Tata Steel has invested £1.4 billion since it acquired its UK business from Corus in April 2007. I would like to place on the record my recognition of the fact that Tata Steel is facing an extremely challenging macroeconomic and market picture, and I believe that it is striving to address the issues as best it can It is now essential that the Government give Tata Steel all the support and assistance they possibly can. If they fail in their duty to do so, the consequences of such inaction will be catastrophic. The action that the Government can and must take urgently is as follows. First, the Minister must accelerate the full implementation of the energy-intensive industries package. The steel industry must be either exempted from the renewables obligation or shifted to a compensation model. In order for that to happen, the Government must instruct the European Commission to give top priority to reviewing the state aid question in this context. That may well mean a reprioritisation of current cases, for example on nuclear power. If that is necessary, so be it. It is essential that the case of steel is fast-tracked now and placed at the top of the pile of British cases that are currently sitting in the European Commission’s in-tray The Minister has been asked to intervene in that spirit on several occasions since the beginning of this Parliament. Her answer has been, “It’s complicated”. We on the Opposition side of the House truly understand that Brussels is a complicated place but, with all due respect, those complications need to be overcome rapidly and effectively. The concerns about state aid must be resolved within the next month, so that the British steel industry can receive immediate respite from the crippling energy costs that it currently faces. The Government’s insistence on rigidly following every letter of EU state aid rules is killing the steel industry and forcing UK steel producers to compete on a playing field that is neither fair nor even Secondly, a further element of relief on the cost of doing business would be the removal of plant and machinery from the business rates valuation process for manufacturing. Tata Steel recently invested £185 million in the construction of a new blast furnace in the Port Talbot steelworks and was promptly clobbered with a £400,000 increase in its business rates bill. That is patently absurd. If we are to tackle the productivity puzzle by driving a manufacturing renaissance, surely we should be encouraging investment, not disincentivising it in that way We recognise that exempting the steel industry from the renewables obligation and removing plant and machinery from business rates will incur a cost to the Exchequer. However, we also know that the collapse of the steel industry would lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs, and the resulting cost to the Exchequer would be exponentially greater. Therefore, I urge the Minister and her colleagues to see that a failure to provide the urgent support to the UK steel industry that is now required would be a classic and tragic case of a false economy Thirdly, it is essential that the Government do more to support industry positions on anti-dumping cases. I am a firm believer in the importance and value of free trade, but I believe even more passionately in the importance and value of fair play. The fact of the matter is that the US and Chinese Governments are simply not playing fair. There are myriad examples of how tariff and non-tariff barriers are being deployed by Washington and Beijing in order to prevent the fair access of British steel to the Chinese and US markets. That has to stop. I urge the Minister to adopt a more aggressive posture in Brussels, Beijing and Washington. She must stand up for steel and secure a fair deal Fourthly, I would like to pick up on a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar about the use of Teesside steel in wind turbines. I would like to contrast that with the regrettable lack of support that the Scottish Government have shown over the Forth road bridge. I understand that the general secretary of Community union has today written to Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones requesting a meeting to explore the support mechanisms that the devolved Governments can and must provide It is 10 minutes to midnight for the steel industry. The future of this vital foundation industry is hanging by a thread. Steel producers and workers need the full support of the Government, and they need it now.']","<|system|>
